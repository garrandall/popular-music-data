In the beginning, God made the land
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So He came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child


I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them


And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild




Skin on skin
Let the love begin
Women


It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lot of fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice


(I give you) Hair, eyes, skin on skin
(Legs) Legs
(Thighs) Thighs
What's that spell? (Spell, what's that spell?)
(What's that spell?) What's that spell?
(What's that spell?) (Women, women)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(Women) Women
(Women) Calling every girl
(Women, women) All around the world
(Women) Women
(Women) Oh, we can't live without them
(Women) Women
