Home, is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I go numb, born with a weak heart
I guess we must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Weâll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's alright, I know nothing's wrong.. nothingâs wrong

Hey, I got plenty of time
Hey, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passage of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up say goodnight... say goodnight

Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time 
Before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be... where I'll be

Hey, we drift in and out
Hey, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home, and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes light up, I see through you
Cover up your blank spot
Hit me on the head like ay-eee
Like ay-eee
Like ay-eee
