You know what you wanna do
See, I'll never ever go nowhere yet
Think of all the times


Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk 'til dawn
And I'm still not ready to go on
That's the way it flows when it gets real good
Back to back flexin' my manhood


(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere


I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (Girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on
Girl, I'm ready to start over again


This freaky escapade has got me going
It gets better when it keeps on flowin'
I broke you off all night and I'm not tired
Bring your body here and take me higher


(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Don't you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere


I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (No, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere (I'm not ready, yeah)
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on (I'm ready to go on and on, babe)
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on (On and on)
Girl, I'm ready to start over again


Baby, we've been at it all night long (All night long)
I'm not ready (Yeah) to end it while it's still strong (While it's still
Strong, baby)
As I look and see the sunshine (As I look) through the window (Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know I should be gone (Should be gone) but I can't let go (But I can't let go)


I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready (I'm not ready, baby) to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on (I'm not ready, baby)
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on (On and on) and on and on (And on and on)
Girl, I'm ready to start over again (Yeah...)
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (See, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go (Uh) nowhere (To go nowhere)
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go (I don't want to get my close, no)
Girl, I'm ready to start over again (Girl)
I wanna go on and on and on and on
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
