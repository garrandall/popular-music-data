Man fuck ya'll with a sick dick
Semi automatic no click click, we don't feel you
Like an elephant, getting fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye, slick rick
Trukfit, t-shirt, talk second, skeet first
Boy your girl a jump off, I hope she land feet first
She give me brain, research, and I prefer reefer
But if you want some coke, that's cool, cause my homies still

(Pump that bass, pump that bass, pump that bass)

Yeah my homies still
Ha ha my homies still
Yeah my homies still
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah


OK, my girl's and cars both skirt off
I like the pussy so wet that I can surf off
In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin
I do it for my niggas, I just do it to these bitches
Boy, I overgrind, overshine, ain't another nigga over Sean
I'm getting paid, it's over time, I'm rolling pine
I'm so divine, I'm west side, west side, dark glasses on
Like I'm going blind, looking like Eazy E, it's just me
And lil weezy wee, get off my dick

Yeah my homies still
Ha ha my homies still
Yeah my homies still
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah


Look, I'm east side, them haters nodding going west,
My niggas pumping so much bass, motherfuckas going deaf
Weezy F, I'm eastside them haters nodding gone rest, my niggas pumpin so much bass (pump that bass)
Tunechi, Tunechi, tunechi I don't love em hoes
Got so much coke, you gon need another nose man
I just played my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them teardrops, I cry your ass a river
Got that Trukfit t-shirt, listening to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt, Hot Boy, free Turk
Pussy for desert, put your ass beneath earth
And I don't sell drugs, but if you need work, my homies still

Yeah my homies still
Ha ha my homies still
Yeah my homies still


Wow, ok, boy this is what I do do
Got your sister dancing not the kind that's in a tutu
Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that vodoo
She say can't nobody do it better, I tell her true true, yeah bitch true true
My my my bro bro say, these bitches ain't shit
I got the girl you came with, and the girl she came with
She leaking and dripping, woah there
I might just come slipping and have your misses wanna go missing
And she addicted to my what dick did, boy I get it

(Lil bitch!)
Yeah my homies still
Ha ha my homies still
Yeah my homies still
(Lil nigga make my)
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, boy
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah (go dumb)


I'm east side, them haters nodding going west,
My niggas pumping so much bass, motherfuckas going deaf
Weezy F, I'm eastside, my nigga Sean from the west,
My niggas pumping so much bass,

Yea
Uhhh
Young Mula
Truk your girl
