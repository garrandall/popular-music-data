I'm sending you a Valentine
In hopes that you're still mine
And if that Valentine
Doesn't reach you, it's okay

Now it's not as bad
Like you thought it would be
Come on, baby, and take my heart

I love you still and I always will
Be yours, be yours

Yours, yours, yours
I'm so in love with you

I'm sending you this Valentine
In hopes that you're still mine
And if that Valentine
Doesn't reach you, it's okay

I can't make up your mind for you
Just have patience
That's all you can do
I love you still and I always will
Be yours, be yours, yours

I'm on my knees
Begging you back, baby
There's nothing I won't do
If I could only hold you
In my arms again
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm so in love with you
There's nothing your baby won't do
If I could just (hold me)
(I'm in love)

I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm in love

Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, baby
Don't give up on me (don't give up on me)
I'm on your side (on your side)
There's nothing, nothing I won't do

I'm down on my knees
Begging you to stay
(Down on my knees)
Darling, please say you
Won't go away (I won't go away)
Ooh, baby (woo, baby, I'm in love)
