Seger Bob
The Fire Inside
The Real Love
I think I've found The Real Love
Genuine and true
I think it's really come my way today babe
I think it's really you

I remember moments looking in your eyes
Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe
Flickering inside

I've been around and round this track
And the only think I lack
Is The Real Love

Every time I see you, every time we touch
I can feel the way you feel for me babe
And it means so much

And every time you look at me
It's just the way it all should be
In The Real Love

Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'
Stay with me stay
I long to see you in the morning sun
Everyday Everyday

So until that moment
When I take your hand
I'm gonna try to do my very best babe
To prove that I'm your man

I'm gonna do my very best
I'm not gonna rest
Until we've got The Real Love

Real Love
Until we've got The Real Love
