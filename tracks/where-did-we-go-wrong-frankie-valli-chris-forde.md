With Chris Forde

Seeing you again
Tryin' to pretend
That I've been fine
Smilin' all the while
Hoping you can see behind my smile

Hearing how you laugh
Knowing what I have and what I've lost
Trying not to touch
Trying not to let it show too much

Where did we go wrong
Were we so right together
Were the best thing ever
Never two so strong

Where did we go wrong?

Asking for your friends
Trying to pretend
There is someone new
Wondering of you cared
Go ahead to face my lonely room

Where did we go wrong
Weren't we so right together
Weren't in love forever
Has it been so long
Where did we go wrong

Where did we go wrong
Didn't we belong together
Weren't we the best thing ever
Never two so strong
Where did we go wrong

Where did we go wrong
Weren't we so right together
Weren't we in love forever
Has it been so long
Where did we go wrong

Where did we go wrong
Weren't we so right together
Weren't we in love forever
Has it been so long
Where did we go wrong
