The words of her promise
The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord, where did they go?

You know somehow forever
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord, where did they go

You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well but Lord she just walked off all alone
But all that is within me is the bitter just ending
And bewildered because her love is gone

Oh the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
