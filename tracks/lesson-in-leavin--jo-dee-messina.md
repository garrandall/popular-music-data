Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

I hear you've been askin' about me
From some of my friends
Well you'd better believe I'm not goin'
Through that again
You're the kind of man a woman thinks she can change.
Oh, but the only thing changin' is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in losin'
Somebody's gonna do to you what you've been doin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in hurtin'
Somebody's gonna leave you with your fire burnin'
And no way to put it out
Baby there ain't no doubt
You're a fool-hearted man

Yeah, you're the kind of man
A woman thinks she can change
But the only thing changin'
Is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

Oh, a fool-hearted man
Oh, whoa
Oh, a fool-hearted man
