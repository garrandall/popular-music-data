Eyes of silver, hungry and aware
Eyes of silver, your mystic love I share
'Cause I'm hungry baby for the love you give away
Kick out all that stupid pride that's standin' in my way

Inside my loving eyes are open wide
Eyes of silver, on which I shall rely
Diamonds are forever, and gold can make you lie
But your eyes of silver shine on, shine on

Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all
Rubies by the hundreds fill the Taj Mahal
Eyes of silver, you tell me what I need
To bring this cold and lonely man down to his bended knees

Inside my lovin' arms are open wide
For you eyes of silver on which I shall rely
Diamonds and gold make you lie, lie, lie
But your eyes of silver, they shine on, shine on
Eyes of silver, baby, shine on, shine on
Baby, shining, yeah yeah, yeah, baby shining

Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all
Rubies by the hundreds fill the Taj Mahal
But your eyes of silver, tell me what I need
To bring this cold and lonely man down to his bended knees

Inside my lovin' arms are open wide
For you eyes of silver on which I shall rely
Diamonds and gold make you lie, lie, lie
But your eyes of silver, they shine on, shine on
Eyes of silver, baby, shine on, shine on
Baby, shining, yeah yeah, yeah, baby shining
