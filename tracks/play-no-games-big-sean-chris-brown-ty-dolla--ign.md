OK, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet
I'm the one you need alone
I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya
Finally famous


I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious
Baby, I want you to take me serious

Wait, wait, waiting for ya
I be wait, wait, waiting for ya
You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love
Tell me who you wanna fucking love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya
Finally famous




I've been waiting on that ass all night though
Girl, don't keep me waiting no more
Yeah, yeah
It's true
Got some things I wanna do to you, baby
Oh
