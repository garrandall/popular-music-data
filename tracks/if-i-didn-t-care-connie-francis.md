If I didn't care
More than words can say
If I didn't care
Would I feel this way?
If this isn't love
Well then maybe I'm wrong
But why do I lie awake all night
And dream all day long

If I didn't care
Would it be the same
Would my every pray begin and end
With just you name
And would I be sure that this is love
Beyond compare
Darlin would it be true
If I didn't care for you

If I didn't care
Would it be the same
Would my every pray begin and end
With just you name
And would I be sure that this is love
Beyond compare
Darlin would it be true
If I didn't care for you
