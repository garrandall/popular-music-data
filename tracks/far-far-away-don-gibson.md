Far far away is my love of yesterday
And she's gone gone gone gone from me from me
Far far away is my life my love my way
And wonder where where where oh where can she be
Days endless days nights dark as may lonely I'm lonely where can she be
Far far away is my love of yesterday
Wonder where where where where where oh where can she be

Far far away...
