Far, far away is my love of yesterday 
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, from me, from me 
Far, far away is my life, my love my way 
Wonder where, where, where, where 
Where oh where can she be? 

Days, endless days nights, dark dismay 
Lonely, I'm lonely where can she be? 
Far, far away is my love of yesterday 
Wonder where, where, where, where where 
Oh where can she be? 

Far, far away is my love of yesterday 
Wonder where, where, where, where where 
Oh where can she be? 
Where where, where, where, where where 
Oh where can she be?
