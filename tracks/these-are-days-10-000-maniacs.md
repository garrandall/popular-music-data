These are the days
Oh


These are days you'll remember
Never before and never since, I promise
Will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it


You'll know it's true
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true, that you are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you


These are days you'll remember
When may is rushing over you with desire
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour


You'll know it's true, that you are blessed and lucky
It's true, that you are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you


These are the days


These are the days
That you might fill with laughter
Until you break
These days you might feel a shaft of light
Make its way across your face
And when you do
You'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
You'll know how it was meant to be
Hear the signs and
Know they're speaking to you
To you
