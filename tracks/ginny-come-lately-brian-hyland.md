I only met you just a couple of days ago
I only met you and I want your lovin' so
Ginny-Come-Lately, sweet, sweet as can be-ee-ee-ee
You may have come lately but Ginny-Come-Lately
You're the one for me

I only had to see the sunlight in your hair
Your soft, soft silhouette to know I'd always care
Ginny-Come-Lately, sweet, sweet as can be-ee-ee-ee
You may have come lately but Ginny-Come-Lately
You're the one for me

You only had to smile a little smile
Do nothing more than look at me
You only had to smile and in a little while
I was dreamin' recklessly-ee-ee-ee

I only met you just a couple of days ago
And oh, my love for you has no more room to grow
Ginny-Come-Lately, my dream come true-ooh-ooh-ooh
You may have come lately but Ginny-Come-Lately
I'm in love with you
