Come and get it now, oh
The drummer, alright, let's give everybody some
(Give everybody some, yeah)



You better give that bass-player some
Yeah, the bass-player
He can have this from me
Give the bass player some
Alright bass, you got it

La-la
La-la-la-la la, la-la-la la



La la la-la la (Give everybody some)
Give everybody some
