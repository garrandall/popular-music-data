She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good
But if you feel so good
She said, she said, what if I could?
But I gotta leave you alone, ah
She said I gotta leave you alone
I, she said, I know you bad
But I want you bad
She said, she said, makes me so sad
That I gotta leave you alone
I said, I gotta leave you alone
Look, look, look

I got my mind on my money,
All I need is a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can ride through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning get my smash on
I want more much baby egg whites
Keep your stomach in your thighs and your legs right
While I'm out here focus getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there e'ry night
Wake up in the morning and you're still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain't gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had to match our Rolexes baby team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good
But if you feel so good
She said, she said, what if I could?
But I gotta leave you alone, ah
She said I gotta leave you alone
I, she said, I know you bad
But I want you bad
She said, she said, makes me so sad
That I gotta leave you alone
I said, I gotta leave you alone
Look, look, look

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I'm done with the front, hit it from behind
Love a loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigger up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get your own you won't be watching mine
Put you up on G show you to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my back bone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I'm right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it's all gone
Best believe I'ma get it right back
It's the hustler in me I know you like that
You probably think I'm with a different broad every night
When I think about it shit man you're probably right
The more I think about it shit you're probably wrong
Cause what you didn't think about it that probably grown.

She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good
But if you feel so good
She said, she said, what if I could?
But I gotta leave you alone, ah
She said I gotta leave you alone
I, she said, I know you bad
But I want you bad
She said, she said, makes me so sad
That I gotta leave you alone
I said, I gotta leave you alone

She said she wish she never met me
Cause she can't just help but let me
Go ahead do whatever the hell I want
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around, and say she don't need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me
But she don't
But maybe this time I'd be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She'll remind me all the dumb shit that I've done all over the years
But she don't be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah

She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good
But if you feel so good
She said, she said, what if I could?
But I gotta leave you alone, ah
She said I gotta leave you alone
I, she said, I know you bad
But I want you bad
She said, she said, makes me so sad
That I gotta leave you alone
I said, I gotta leave you alone.
