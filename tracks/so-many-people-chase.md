Today the streets were filled with strangers
Callin' names and choosin' sides
Never thinkin' about tomorrow

More and more,
We're running blind,
Makes you wonder where we're headin'

So many people
All in a hurry
Livin' in circles of worship and worry
Dressing so long, that they're late for the show

So many judging the heads that their turning
So busy fighting that there's no time for learnin'
And they're turnin' their backs on people
They might like to know

We may be runnin' out of heros
It seems they tumble everyday
We killed a man
Just for careless dreamin'

More and more
We're running blind
Makes you wonder where we're headin'

So many people, all in a hurry
Livin in circles of worship and worry
And dressing so long, that they're late for the show
