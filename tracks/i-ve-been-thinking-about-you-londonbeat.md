We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you

Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
Oh, yes I have baby
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
Got you on my mind

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
Got you on my mind

What good is being here without you?
I wanna know
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, uhh yeah
I've been thinking about you

I've been thinking about you
Oh baby, can't get you out of my mind
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
You read me baby, I think about you all the time
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
Got you on my mind
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
