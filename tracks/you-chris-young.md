The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you


Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you


Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that


No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you
