Wear this ring with love forever
Wear this ring with love

This ring means I love you
And this ring means you love me too
It's a ring to seal our love together
You for me, me always for you

And you be my woman
And, baby, I'll be your man
If you just wear this ring
With love forever

This ring will tell a story
Think of all the good things we got to
Settle down and have two little children
A boy for me and a
Sweet little girl for you

How sweet it is for a
Man to love his woman
And, baby, for a woman
To love her man

Please, wear this ring with love
(Promise me, baby) forever
Forever (I know you're gonna do it for me)
Forever (ever and ever) and more

Wear this ring with love (hey)
Wear this ring with love (listen now)

Now just put this ring on your finger
And we will be on a ship of love
You and me having lots of fun together
Making real, all the things we dream of

How sweet it is for a
Man to love his woman
And, baby, for a woman
To love her man

Please, wear this ring with love
(Promise me, baby)
Wear this ring with love
(Don't ever pull it off of your finger)
Wear this ring with love
(I know you're gonna)
Wear this ring with love
(You're gonna do it for me now)
