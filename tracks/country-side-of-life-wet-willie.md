You can have your buildings and your heavy arithmetic
I don't need no crowded streets or city slicker tricks
I just need to be someplace where I can move around
Look down at my toes and I can still see the ground
Gimme that country side of life
Which way I can stretch out right
Gimme the countryside oh lord
That country side of life
Which way I don't get uptight
Gimme the countryside
I'm going down to the fishing pond where I can throw my line
It don't matter what fish I catch I only wanna rest my mind
The only fish you get downtown ain't caught with a hook and sinker
Put on your brakes beep beep honk your horn look out now turn on your blinker
Gimme that country side of life
Which way I can stretch out right
Gimme the countryside oh
That country side of life
Which way I don't get uptight
Gimme the countryside
I was born in a Georgia town with a natural lazy streak
Laid back lovers just playing their games and staying off their feet
Nobody trying to get on your nerves or trying to get what you got
Live and let live by the golden rule now don't it just hit the spot
Gimme that country side of life
Which way I can stretch out right
Gimme the countryside oh lord
That country side of life
Which way I don't get uptight
Gimme the countryside
Gimme that country side of life
Which way I can stretch out right
Gimme the countryside oh lord
That country side of life
Which way I don't get uptight
Gimme the countryside
