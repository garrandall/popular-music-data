Maybe I hang around here a little more than I should
We both know I've got somewhere else to go
But I got somethin' to tell you that I never thought I would
That I believe you really ought to know
I love you, I honestly love you

You don't have to answer, I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
But this is pure and simple and you must realize
That it's comin' from my heart and not my head
I love you, I honestly love you

I'm not tryin' to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not tryin' to make you anything at all
But this feelin' doesn't come along ev'ry day
And you shouldn't blow the chance when you've got the chance to say
I love you, I love you, I honestly love you

If we both were born in another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours and here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leavin' it at this
I love you, I honestly love you, I honestly love you
