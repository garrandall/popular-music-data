People, don't you worry, I know what I'm doin'
I know what love's all about
Oh this little girl won't make a fool out of me
Because I'm gonna straighten her out
Oh yeah

Oh this little girl is just about as mean as they come, she is now
She don't even act nice, once in a while like some, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, 'Trouble' is her middle name
But I'm glad that's the way she came
I could be the one to tame this little girl, oh yeah

Oh this little girl won't like me much at first, she won't now
And after a while she's gonna think that I'm the worst, oh yeah
Well I won't treat her with kid gloves and I won't shower her with lots of love
But I'll make an angel of this little girl

Oh this little girl tries to make every guy her slave, oh yeah
But this little man is gonna take her by the hand
And I'm gonna show her the way to behave

Oh this little girl is kinda used to gettin' her way, but no more now
There'll gonna be some changes made startin' today
Oh, oh I said now everyone will be surprised when I cut her down to size
And no one's gonna recognize my little girl

I tell you again now
This little girl, I'm a man now
This little girl, I'll tell you again now
My little girl, oh yeah this little girl
