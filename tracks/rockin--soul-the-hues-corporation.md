If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul
Rock down on the inside
If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul

Each day I feel so much closer to you
But we both got to keep the lovin' comin' on through
'Cause when the train of thought gets off the track
The engineer, naturally, starts pullin' back
'Cause we gotta have a chance to do our dance
And we'll never go wrong when we're singin' our song

So if you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul
Rock down on the inside
If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul

My heart's on my sleeve for the whole world to see
'Cause in my life there's only you and me
You're my firm foundation, the love I need
Please stand right beside of the soul you feed

'Cause we gotta have a chance to do our dance
Yeah, we gotta have a chance to do our dance
And we'll never go wrong when we're singin' our song

So if you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul

If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul
Rock on from the inside
Get down to your rockin' soul
Roll it from the outside
Get down to your rockin' soul
Got to get on down, got to get on down
Get down to your rockin' soul
Got to pad your feet when you feel the beat
Get down to your rockin' soul
Rock on from the outside, children
Get down to your rockin' soul
Roll it from the inside, baby
Get down to your rockin' soul
Got to get on down, got to get on down...
