Said you'd always be my friend
Never let me down again
Well you did 'cause baby it's over
I'm not about to play your game
I don't want you to feel the pain, the way I did
But that doesn't matter

'Cause it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to change
'Cause it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to break

About a hundred times we try
So go and cry a little more
Save your tears
For some other lover
Try and lay your guilt on me
I wish you'd finally try and see
You were the one
Who killed all our chances

'Cause it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to change
'Cause it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to break

'Cause it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to change
You know it didn't take long, for it all to happen
And it didn't take long, for our love to break
