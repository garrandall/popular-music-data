I know you're thinking
I've been better off without you by my side
But baby this season
I don't want another cold rainy July

You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
'Cause I don't have you
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not!
'Cause I don't have you


Come back to the world, come back to the world
Baby back to my world
Come back to the world, come back to the world
Baby back to my world

And I still remember
The way you used to gently touch my face
And since last December
I've discovered that no one can take your place

Don't be thinking that I'm better now
'Cause I'm not!
'Cause I don't have you
Don't be thinking that I'm better now

'Cause I'm not!
'Cause I don't have you



And when the nights get lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one
Tell me you can feel it once again
I know that we can love like we did then...so
Bring it on home
