Shawty fine, Shawty Tight
Shoulda Stayed There All Night
With You (You) With You
I Missed Ya, Picked Ya
Now It's Time I
Get Back up With You(You)Girl With You
Oh Yeah
We Used To Kick Up At The Park
Now She's All Grown Up (up)
Rockin Them Stilettos
Jumpin up Outta That Mercedes Truck (truck)


It Was Kiesha
It Was Sonya
It Was Tonya
It Was Monique
It Was Nece
It Was Keke
Now I See You At 23
All I Can Say Is


Ah, Ah
And I Don't Need No Hook For This Hit
Cause Shawty Right There Is a ten, a ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten


Dior Jeans
Walk so mean
Burberry Fragance On My Shirt From When She
Hug Me
Hard As A Rock From When She Touched Me
Thinkin Now That She Would've Loved Me
What It Is, What It Ain't, Tell Me What To Do
I Know I'm Late But Destiny Brought Me Back To You
Time went byTurned You Into A Butterfly
So I'm here to say hello, Tell Yo *** Goodbye


It Was Kiesha
It Was Sonya
It Was Tonya
It Was Monique
It Was Nece
It Was Keke
Now That I See You At 23
All I Can Say Is


Ah, Ah
And I Don't Need No Hook For This Hit
Cause Shawty Right There Is a ten, a ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten
Shawty you a ten
A ten


If She Fine, If Shawty Is A Dime
You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her
If She Go, And You Love Her
You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her
If She Fix You Eggs And Grits In The Morning
You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her
Pancakes With The Bacon On The Side
(You Should Tip Me, You Should Tip Me)

Shawty Rock To The Beat For Ya Boy
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Rock To The Beat For Ya Boy
Now To See You At 23 All I Can Say Is
