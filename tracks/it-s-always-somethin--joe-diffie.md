Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by.
What else can I do, but wonder if it's you.
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin'
is like a soundtrack, to the love we had.
I should be over you by now, but every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me.
Everywhere I go, there's a memory.
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard,
There's no way to prepare my heart.
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do.
If only I could just stop missin' you.
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing.
But it's always something.

Lunch time, a new place. 
Waitress says her name. 
Why does it have to be, Emily. 
Corner store, stop in. 
Someone ask, "How ya been?" 
I say I wouldn't know. 
I really gotta go. 
Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how. 
Cause every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me.
Everywhere I go, there's a memory.
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard,
There's no way to prepare my heart.
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do.
If only I could just stop missin' you.
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing.
But it's always something.
