When you get right down to it
Isn't this moment what
It's all about, girl

And when you get right down to it
Don't you just feel this
Moment's last everything

Holding you and touching you
Girl, I need a whole lifetime
To do all the things
That I wanna do for you

When you get right down to it
Doesn't this moment
Wash away the bad times

And when you get right down to it
Doesn't all the hurt
You ever felt disappear

Holding you and touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to relive
This moment again

Yeah, holding you and touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to relive
This moment again

Oh, girl, again and again
All over again, all over again
Just live it again, just live it again
We got to live it again, girl
