Where have the people gone
Seems like there's no one hangin' on
Look through the window
The houses are empty
Hey, everybody's out of town
Seems like I'm the only one around

All of the streets are bare
No traffic tie-ups anywhere
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Hey, everybody's out of town
Seems like, I'm the only one around

Everyone's moved out
From the ghetto
Lots of space
Empty apartments
No more pollution
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
I'm gonna send out a message to noah
Hey, better send some people down
Everyone on earth
Is out of town
