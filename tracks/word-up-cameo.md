Oh!


Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell yo brother, yo sister
And yo momma too
'Cause we're about to throw down
And you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on baby, tell me, what's the word?


Oh, word up!
Everybody say when you hear their call
You've got to get it underway
Word up! It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You'll know that you'll be heard


Now all you sucker DJs
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize
That you're acting like fools
Give us music, we can use it
We need to dance
We don't have the time
For psychological romance
No romance, no romance
No romance for me, mama
Come on baby, tell me what's the word


Oh, word up!
Everybody say when you hear their call
You've got to get it underway


Dial "L" for low
Come on, all you people say...
W-O-R-D up - W-O-R-D up
