Come and talk of all the things we did today
Hear and laugh about our funny little ways
While we have a few minutes to breathe
And I know that it's time you must leave

But darling be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
Darling be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waitin' since I toddled
For the great relief of havin' you to talk to

And now a quarter of my life is almost passed
I think, I've come to see myself at last
And I see that the time spent confused
Was the time that I spent without you
And I feel myself in bloom

So darling be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waitin' since I toddled
For the great relief of havin' you to talk to

Go and beat your crazy head against the sky
Try and see beyond the houses and your eyes
It's okay to shoot the moon

Darling be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
Darling be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waitin' since I toddled
For the great relief of havin' you to talk to
