Drums
A little guitar, please
One, two, three, four

I hope you're ready for the time of your life
Just look at me, I put a gleam in your eye
Buckle-up, we're gonna take you for a ride

Let's go, we gotcha goin' good in a vibe
Everybody put your hands to the sky
Buckle-up, we're gonna take you, take you high

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
La-la, la-la, la-la, let me see how you vibe
It's on, it's on, it's on

Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
'Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it, dance 'til we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

Okay now, are you ready?
One, two, one, two, three, four

Show stoppin' when I step in the place
Before it's done, you're gonna beg me to stay
Get on board, come on, let's ride the wave

Let's go, let's go, we just do what we do
Watch me break and pop, I'll pass it to you
You wanna rock like us 'cause we're never second place

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
La-la, la-la, la-la, let me see how you vibe
It's on, it's on, it's on

Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
'Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it, dance 'til we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

Okay now, are you ready?
One, two, one, two, three

Th-th-there is no competition
That's why we in the number one position
Your crew can't hang with us, man, we're too dangerous
Ain't got the style or the stamina

Just doin' my thing, get hooked on my swing
Rockin' the place, droppin' the bass, makin' all the girls sing
Yeah, we make the bell ring
It's on, it's on

Drums, yeah
A little guitar please
One, two, three, four

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
La-la, la-la, la-la, let me see how you vibe
It's on, it's on, it's on

Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
'Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it, dance 'til we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

Show me, show me, show me, show me, show what you got
Come on, come on, come on, come on, ready or not
La-la, la-la, la-la, let me see how you vibe
It's on, it's on, it's on

Get crazy, crazy, crazy, take it over the top
'Cause we, 'cause we, 'cause when we rock we let it rock
Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it, dance 'til we drop
It's on, it's on, it's on

It's on
