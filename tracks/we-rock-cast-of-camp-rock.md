'Cause we rock
We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock on


Come as you are
You're a superstar
The world's in your pocket
And you know it


You can feel that beat
Running through your feet
Heart's racing fast
You're rock and rollin'


All that you need is the music to take you
To some other place where you know you belong


Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice
Following our dreams
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world is going to bring us down
The louder we go
Well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on


We got the music in our souls
And it's the thing we want the most
It picks us up when we fall down
It turns our world around


'Cause we rock
(Camp Rock!)
We rock, we rock on
Every day, it's every night
'Cause we rock
(Camp Rock!)
We rock, we rock on
It's all we want, and doing now


Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice
Following our dreams
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world is going to bring us down
The louder we go
Well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on


Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice
Following our dreams
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world is going to bring us down
The louder we go
Well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock (we rock!)
We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock on
We rock!
Camp Rock!
