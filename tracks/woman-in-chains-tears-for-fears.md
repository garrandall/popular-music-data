You better love lovin' and you better behave
You better love lovin' and you better behave
Woman in Chains
Woman in Chains

Calls her man the Great White Hope
Says she's fine, she'll always cope
Woman in Chains
Woman in Chains

Well I feel lying and waiting is a poor man's deal
(A poor man's deal)
And I feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel
(Your eyes of steel)
Well, it's a world gone crazy
Keeps Woman in Chains, woah
Woman in chains
Woman in chains

Trades her soul as skin and bones
(You better love lovin' and you better behave)
Sells the only thing she owns
(You better love lovin' and you better behave)
Woman in Chains
(The sun and the moon)
Woman in Chains

Men of Stone
Men of Stone

Well I feel deep in your heart there are wounds time can't heal
(That time can't heal)
And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
Well you know what I mean
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps Woman in Chains

It's under my skin but out of my hands
I'll tear it apart but I won't understand
I will not accept the Greatness of Man

It's a world gone crazy
Keeps Woman in Chains
(Gone crazy, keeps woman in chains)

So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
(The sun and the moon)
So Free Her
(The wind and the rain)
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
So Free Her
(The Sun and the moon)
So Free Her
(The wind and the rain)
So Free Her...
