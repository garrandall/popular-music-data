Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk like a man

Oh, how she tried to cut you down to size
By telling dirty lies to your friend
But your own father said
Give her up
Don't bother
The world isn't coming to an end

You better walk like a man, talk like a man
Walk like a man, my son
No woman's worth
Crawling on the earth
So walk like a man, my son

Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh

Bye, baby
I don't mean maybe
Gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be crying
On account of all your lying
Forget
Just look who's laughing now

Why don't you walk like a man fast as he can
Walk like a man from you
He'll tell the world
Forget about it, girl
And walk like a man from you

Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk

Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk

Why don't you walk like a man fast as he can
Walk like a man from you
He'll tell the world
Forget about it, girl
And walk like a man from you

Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk

Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohoh
Walk, walk, walk, walk

Walk, walk, walk, walk
