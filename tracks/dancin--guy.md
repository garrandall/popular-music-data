GUY
Can I have this dance?
I know you've never danced with a man like me before
And when you dance with me
You'll never want to dance no more
Let me show you

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

Looking in your eyes
As we start to dance the night away
I can feel your heart
As you're pushing your body close to mine, yeah

To the beat, to the drum
To the music till we're one
Don't you worry about the crowd
'Cause there's no one else around

I can freak it if you like
I can make you feel all right
I can serve it to you right
'Cause I'd like to explore your body tonight

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

Baby, take my hand
And let me guide you to this dance of love
We'll be moving so close almost like we're making love
Baby, bring your body and let it bounce with me

To the beat, to the drum
To the music till we're one
Don't you worry about the crowd
'Cause there's no one else around

I can freak it if you like
I can make you feel all right
I can serve it to you right
'Cause I'd like to explore your body tonight

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

Do you wanna dance with me?
(Hey)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Hey)
I want you to, I want you
(Hey)
(And you know that I do)

Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want you to, I want you
(Hey, hey, hey, I do)

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing, when we're out on the floor
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

Can I dance? Can I dance? Can I dance with you?
Can I dance? Can I dance? Can I dance with you?
Can I dance? Can I dance? Can I dance with you?
So I slowly move closer, let her know that I want her

She Y2K
