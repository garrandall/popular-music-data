Night school strutter just struttin' around
Can't find work since the band left town
Can't get up cause he can't get down

He's a heartbroken bopper

Honor roll student graduation day
Summa cum laude is a big okay
Car wash king is havin' beans today

He's a heartbroken bopper

Rise from the gutters, there's too much has gone to waste
Rise with the others, there's too much is done in haste

He's a heartbroken bopper
