I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me, I'm the man who won

Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was riding night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger
Because I steal hearts and souls

Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

Some men call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me Sinner, Lord
Some men call me Saint
Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there isn't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothing left to gain

Outlaw man
Outlaw man
