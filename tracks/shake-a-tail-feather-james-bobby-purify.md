Ow! Get it baby! Alright
Well I heard about the fella
You been dancing with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby?
Or didn't you think I could?
Well I know that the Boogaloo is out of sight
But the shing-a-ling's the thing tonight
And if that was you and me out there baby
I would have shown you how to do it right
Do it right, do it right
Do it right
Ah!
Twistin'
Shake it shake it shake it shake it baby
Here we go loop-de-loop
Shake it up baby
Here we go loop-de-lie
A-bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on let me see you shake your tail feather
Ah!
(Twistin')
Shake it shake it shake it shake it baby
Here we go loop-de-loop (oh yeah)
Shake it up baby
Here we go loop-de-lie
A-bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Ah!
Twistin'
Oh yeah
Alright
C'mon girl, baby
C'mon child
Do the shing-a-ling
Shake that thing
C'mon O yeah...
