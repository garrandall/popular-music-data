As the sun is rising
We’d come back to earth
I’m gonna leave your loving
And it’s gonna hurt
So glad I got you
I don’t wanna let you go

These precious moments are what life’s about
If you didn’t know that already
One kiss will ease your doubt
No need to hurry
Cause I’m right here next to you
And whatever we do

Let’s do it slowly and take our time
And do it slowly and let our love unwind
As if we only got tonight
And whatever we do
Let’s do it slowly

And in the morning
When we hear the clock
You’re touching me so deeply
I don’t want you to stop
I wanna hold you
But I’ll have to let you go

Only I’ll be running like the world's on fire
Only thing that’s burning, baby
Is my desire
I’m gonna hurry just to get back here with you
And whatever we do

I’m gonna do it slowly
And take our time
And do it slowly and let our love unwind

As if we only got tonight
And whatever we do
Let’s do it slowly
Slowly
Slowly

Cause when I’m by your side
With your heartbeat on mine
I know a friendly one can make our time stand still
We will

Slowly
And take our time
And do it slowly
And let our love unwind

As if we only got tonight
And whatever we do
I wanna do it slowly

And take our time
And do it slowly
As if we only got tonight
So whatever we do
