Baby, take off your clothes and come on
Turn off the lights 'cause girl it's on
Now that we are all alone
I want you to sex me

Oh yeah, it's time for that sex me remix to pop off
You know what I'm sayin'?
Check it out, this is going to take off your clothes tip
So fellas grab your ladies and make it real wet

Baby, take off your clothes and come on
Turn off the lights 'cause girl it's on
Now that we are all alone
I want you to sex me

Listen to the remix, baby
Come here, girl

Come over here and let me take off your clothes
'Cause things I wanna do to you, nobody has to know
Just lay your body right here, lady have no fear
'Cause ecstasy is near, oh yes it is

Anything unexpected, bring it on
Any secret fantasies

So I can see 'Sex me baby' written on your face
Slow baby, slow baby steady as we go
Up and down to a sixty-nine tempo

Yeah, now throw your body parts around
Now let me hear you make a ohaah sound
'Cause I'm your lover man
So call your other man and say you found another man

Baby, take off your clothes and come on
Turn off the lights 'cause girl it's on
Now that we are all alone
I want you to sex me

Baby, take off your clothes and come on
Turn off the lights 'cause girl it's on
