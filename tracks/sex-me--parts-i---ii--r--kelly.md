Pimpin, it aint easy for me
Especially the way these chicks be checking for me
It's like all the time
And it's like everywhere 
And it's like into the club honey's stop and stare
Wait a minute..

It's not my ego ya'll that's just the way it is
Showbiz like no biz
I love girls throughout my whole career
From suburb chicks to the cuties on the bus stop
Church girls all the way up to the movie stars
I'm not trippin when it come down to the woman
Ryse is down with all signs, oh let me tell ya'll something


These are the zodiac signs that I wanna make love too
The zodiac signs that I wanna get next too
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world

These are the zodiac signs that I wanna take shopping
The zodiac signs that I wanna take club-hoppin
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world



Now, let's get a hotel room...And have an after party
The show is over now it's time to freak somebody
So throw your hands up and represent your sign
Fella's I don't know about you but Im about to make one of these hunnies mine


Ladies let me tell you all about the Capricorn
See when it comes to sex it's guaranteed some babies will be born
See I've got three of um from listening to the 12-play
Aquarius I tell you they can go from night till day

Kells I ain't trippin 
Ryse loves um all kinds, yeah
They all mine
All dimes
All fine, yeah...


These are the zodiac signs that I wanna make love too
The zodiac signs that I wanna get next too
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world

These are the zodiac signs that I wanna take shopping
The zodiac signs that I wanna take club-hoppin
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world


(Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini) I see you in the club with your hands held real high
(Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra) The way you treat your boy I'd do anything for ya
(Sagittarius, Scorpio, Capricorn, Aquarius) See I ain't gonna front it is all of ya'll I really love...

I love you, wooo I love you, wooo, I love you, wooo, I love you.....


These are the zodiac signs that I wanna make love too
The zodiac signs that I wanna get next too
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world

These are the zodiac signs that I wanna take shopping
The zodiac signs that I wanna take club-hoppin
See I ain't trippin when it comes down to these girls
We are the world, we are the world


And this is the remix
Turn it up in your jeep
Play it when you go to sleep
On your answerin service
On a late night creep
