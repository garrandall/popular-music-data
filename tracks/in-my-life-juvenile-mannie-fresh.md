Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls
lil children, dogs and cats
right now, you are listening to the incredible drum patterns of
DJ Mannie Fresh

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN !


Mannie: I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels,
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds,
Got alot of drinks, steppin out, gators, coca-cola mink
Juvenile: I Need it in my life, I want it in my life
come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life


Its ya nigga Juve, from the magnolia, still loakin,
You ho's gon' know whats up with me
Bust the pussy open
Loose titty, loose booty,
round down and up,
if a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fo'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in the he and she say
Its UTP day, we with the streets may
They represent us when they hear us at the DJs
Break bread with me nigga, is ya mad with me
though we was beefin , your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down, give me a whip, give me
a bitch and let her blow me down,
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, i'm so grimey
I promise you something, I bet you gon find me
I'm a eat, purchase, whatever I please
CO, give me the keys, aww please, I need two of these




I'm a be so courageous,
and so contagious,
Until my fucking rap sheets gonna recieve mo' pages,
Listen to Juve cuz this my year mon' (my year mon')
Invision I'm bout to kick it in here mon' (in here mon')
Don't you see the Soldiers and Bauds when I appear mon' (appear mon')
About being written on my face cuz I don't fear none (don't fear none)
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up,
Skip, Smoove put in work and wacko poppin the chopper
I Scream the "U" cuz I mean it, 
the only difference is you be throwing your set up when you screamin
I Seen it, Man all of the obstacles that I been through,
what make you think i'm a be scared of a bitch like you,
I'm ya dog, let me get it all consign me,
you ain't paid them last people yet, 
dog don't even remind me,
I gain knowlege, my game polished, and it is obvious
you can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit




Can I untape the clips and chill ?
Show my niggers its real,
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills,
I got alot of work I know thats gonna be ahead of me still,
But my peace mentality gon' keep me ahead in the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase,
Now cut thru the talking and bring me straight to the safe,
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape,
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensics to trace,
I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I had been payin',
I figured about a lil'bit less than 75 grand,
and my dog Rocky, caught a nickel for a pistol,
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you,
Life is at a standstill, all change in this damn field,
What you say, can get you and ya mans killed,
This my last chance to come up, this gotta be it,
Juve comin up, the first round' lottery pick
