Summer lovin' had me a blast


Summer lovin' happened so fast


I met a girl crazy for me


Met a boy cute as can be


Summer days driftin' away, to uh-oh those summer nights


Uh Well-a well-a well-a huh


Tell me more, tell me more


Did you get very far?


Tell me more, tell me more


Like does he have a car?


Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh


She swam by me, she got a cramp


He ran by me, got my suit damp


I saved her life, she nearly drowned


He showed off, splashing around


Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights


Uh well-a well-a well-a huh


Tell me more, tell me more


Was it love at first sight?


Tell me more, tell me more


Did she put up a fight?


Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh


Took her bowling in the arcade


We went strolling, drank lemonade


We made out under the dock


We stayed out 'till ten o'clock


Summer fling, don't mean a thing, but uh-oh those summer nights


Uh well-a well-a well-a huh


Tell me more, tell me more


But you don't gotta brag


Tell me more, tell me more


Cos' he sounds like a drag


Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, 
shoo-bop bop,shoo-bop bop, 
shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, 
shoo-bop bop, YEAH


He got friendly, holding my hand


While she got friendly down in the sand


He was sweet, just turned eighteen


Well she was good you know what I mean


Woah!


Summer heat, boy and girl meet, but uh-oh those summer nights


Woo, woo, woo


Tell me more, tell me more


How much dough did he spend?


Tell me more, tell me more


Could she get me a friend?


It turned colder - that's where it ends


So I told him we'd still be friends


Then we made our true love vow


Wonder what he's doing now


Summer dreams ripped at the seams, bu-ut oh those su-ummer nights....


Tell me more, tell me more!
