When the morning comes
I find myself just missin' you
Find myself just wishin'
You were laying by my side

But as my day goes on
I'm wonderin' if you're missing me
Wonderin' if you're wishing
We were laying side by side

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I get the message loud and clear
Let yourself come home
Forget the others bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs

But when my evening comes
I'm wishin' I was kissing you
I'm fishin' for the words
To lay on you to make it right
Make it right
Make it right, yeah

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I get a message loud and clear
Let yourself come home
Forget the others bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs
