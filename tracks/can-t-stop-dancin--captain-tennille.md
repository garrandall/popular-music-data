Oh, you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
You know you can't stop dancin'
Yeah, yeah

Just because
The band has packed it up and gone home
You know you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone

Cause if you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
You're gonna turn the music back on

There's a rhythm in the universe
And the music is always there
But whenever life goes wrong
Sometimes it's so hard to hear just the same

We've got to move with the time
If you don't
You're gonna be left behind
Just remember that the beat goes on
Pretty soon
They're gonna play your song

And you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
You know you can't stop dancin'
Yeah, yeah

Just because
The band has packed it up and gone home
You know you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone

Cause if you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
You're gonna turn the music back on
