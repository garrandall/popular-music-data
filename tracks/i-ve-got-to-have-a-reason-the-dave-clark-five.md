I've got to have a reason
I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason why
You're walkin' out on me

There's somethin' on your mind
But you won't tell me
Mmm, tell me why you're cryin'
And I will help you, help you, help you

But I gotta have a reason
I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason why
You're walkin' out on me

If there is someone else
Then I would like to know
But you know I'm never ever gonna find out
If you won't tell me, tell me, tell me

But I gotta have a reason
I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason why
You're walkin' out on me

If you tell me what you're thinkin'
Everything will be all right (everything will be all right)
Love will never leave your side (love will never leave your side)
If you place your trust in me

I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason why
You're walkin' out on me

I got to have a reason
I got to have a reason
