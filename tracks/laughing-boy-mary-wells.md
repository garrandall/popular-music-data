Laughing boy
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
That's what they used to call you
Before you found a new love to take my place
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

Laughing boy
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
That's what they used to call you
You always wore a smile upon your face
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

But as I look at you now
I know that somehow
The smile you're wearing is untrue
Laughing boy
(Laughing boy)
I think you're blue

Your new love
(Your new love)
She really must have hurt you
She really must have filled your heart with pain
'Cause I know you well
(Know you well)
And you could never fool me

I know that somehow you're not the same
(La la la la la la la la)
As I look at you now
I know that somehow

When you say you're happy
You're lying
Laughing boy
(Laughing boy)
I believe you've been crying
(La la la la la la la la)

Don't you know that it's true
I still love you
Just as much as I did before
So laughing boy
(Come on home)

Come on home, laughing boy
(Come on home)
Come on home, laughing boy
(Come on home)
And smile once more
