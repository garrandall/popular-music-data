A place where nobody dared to go, 
the love that we came to know 
They call it Xanadu 

And now, open your eyes and see, 
what we have made is real 
We are in Xanadu 

A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star 
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally 


Xanadu, Xanadu, (now we are here) in Xanadu 
Xanadu, Xanadu, (now we are here) in Xanadu 

Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanadu 
The love, the echoes of long ago, 
you needed the world to know 
They are in Xanadu 

The dream that came through a million years 
That lived on through all the tears, it came to Xanadu 

A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star 
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally 


Now that I'm here, now that you're near in Xanadu 
Now that I'm here, now that you're near in Xanadu, Xanadu
