A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
(It takes your breath)
(It'll leave you blind)


And now, open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
(A dream of it)
(We offer you)


A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally


Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu (Xanadu)
Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu


Xanadu
Your neon lights will shine
For you, Xanadu


The love, the echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
(With every breath)
(You drift away)


The dream that came through a million years
That lived on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu
(The dream you dream)
(Well it will happen for you)


A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally


Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu (Xanadu)
Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu
(Xanadu Xanadu)


Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
Xanadu
