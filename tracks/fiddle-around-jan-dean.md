Wo wo wo fiddle around, fiddle around
They would fiddle around & around, all over the town

Do you remember Judy?
Her eyes were big & blue
Her kisses were so tender & warm
But her heart was so untrue
She used to fiddle around, fiddle around
She would fiddle around & around all over the town

Susie, she'd be faithful
Kathy gave me her heart
But they would start a-cheatin' on me
Each time we were apart
Oh they would fiddle around, fiddle around
They would fiddle around & around all over the town

(Scat singing)

Well, I've had lots of girlfriends
When all is said & done
Baby, you're the only girl for me
'Cause you're the only one
Who doesn't fiddle around, fiddle around
You don't fiddle around & around all over the town
You don't fiddle around & around all over the town
