When you pray with every breath
You know that is free as the love you have
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take
There's no peace
You close your eyes
I'm all out of truth, I'm out of alibis
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take


We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one
He gives a new kind of meaning to what I am
I know that I could never love any other man
One of these days he'll understand, understand


And his face, his heaven scent
He makes me believe there must be something else
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take
I can feel the need in you
There isn't a thing I won't let you do
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take


We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one
He gives a new kind of meaning to what I am
I know that I could never love any other man
One of these days he'll understand, understand
Understand

We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one
He gives a new kind of meaning to what I am
I know that I could never love any other man
One of these days he'll understand, understand
We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one
We're gonna love one another
We're gonna love one another
Give up resisting one by one, one by one
