Yield not to temptation
Oh my love, while I am away

Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
I'll be back home to stay

Yield not to temptation
And then no one lead you astray

So many times you gonna be lonely
So many times you gonna be blue
But yield not, yield not yeah
Oh, yield not, yield not

Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
Oh, I'll be back home to stay

Yield not to temptation, oh

So many times you gonna be lonely
So many times you gonna be blue
Yield not, yield not
Oh yeah, yield not

Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
I'll be back home to stay

Yield not to temptation
Yield not to temptation
Yield not to temptation
