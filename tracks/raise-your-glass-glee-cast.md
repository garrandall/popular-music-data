Right right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 AM turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you are gangsta'
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise Your Glass!

Slam slam oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out
Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now

Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you a gangsta'
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

Blaine with the Warblers:
So raise your glass if you are wrong In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise Your Glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!

My glass is empty...that sucks!

So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool (treated like a fool)
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always
Party on our own...

So raise your
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be never be!
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Won't you come on! and come on! and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
Won't you come on! and come on! and
Raise your glass
For me
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
...for me
