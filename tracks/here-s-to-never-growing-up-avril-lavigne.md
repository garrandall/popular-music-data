Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs,
With the boombox blaring as we're falling in love,
Gotta get up in the morning, but we're living right now,
Singing, "Here's to never growing up."

Call up all our friends.
Go hard this weekend.
Just for no reason,
I don't think we'll ever change.

Meet you at the spot,
Half-past ten o'clock.
We don't ever stop.
And we're never gonna change.

Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever,
Hey, we can stay forever young.

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs,
With the boombox blaring as we're falling in love,
Gotta get up in the morning, but we're living right now,
Singing "Here's to never growing up".

We'll be running down the streets, yeah, never look back.
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever. We're still living like that."
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups,
Singing, "Here's to never growing up."

Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.
Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.

We live like rockstars.
Dancing in your car.
This is who we are.
I don't think we'll ever change.

They say, "Just grow up."
But they don't know us.
We only live once,
And we're never gonna change.

Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever,
Hey, we can stay forever young.

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs,
With the boombox blaring as we're falling in love,
Gotta get up in the morning, but we're living right now,
Singing "Here's to never growing up".

We'll be running down the streets, yeah, never look back.
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever. We're still living like that."
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups,
Singing, "Here's to never growing up."

Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.
Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.

Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever,
Hey, we can stay forever young.

Oh, singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs,
With the boombox blaring as we're falling in love,
Gotta get up in the morning, but we're living right now,

Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.
Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.

Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up.
Oh, whoa-oh, oh, whoa-oh.
Here's to never growing up!
