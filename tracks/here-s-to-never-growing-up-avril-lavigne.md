Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' here's to never growing up


Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change


Say, won't you say, "Forever?" Stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young


Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blaring as we're fallin' in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street, yelling, "Kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin' here's to never growing up
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Here's to never growing up
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Here's to never growing up


We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change (hell no)
They say just grow up
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change


Say, won't you say, "Forever?" Stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young


Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Here's to never growing up
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa (so raise your glass and say)
Here's to never growing up


Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Here's to never growing up (no, we're never growing up)
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Here's to never growing up
