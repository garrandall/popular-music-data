You need cooling
Baby, I'm not fooling
I'm gonna send you
Back to schooling

Way down inside
Honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love, oh

Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love

You've been learning
And baby, I been learning
All them good times
Baby, baby, I've been discerning

A-way, way down inside
A-honey, you need-a
I'm gonna give you my love, ah
I'm gonna give you my love, ah

Oh, whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
I don't want more

(You've got to
Bleed on me)

Ah ah ah ah ah...
Love, love, loooove
Oh, babe, oh

You've been cooling
And baby, I've been drooling
All the good times, baby
I've been misusing

A-way, way down inside
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you
Every inch of my love
I'm gonna give you my love
Yes, alright, let's go

Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love

Way down inside
Woman, you need it
Love

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, oh
Shake for me, girl
I wanna be your backdoor man

Hey, oh, hey, oh
Hey, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hoo-ma, ma, hey
Keep a-cooling, baby
A-keep a-cooling, baby
A-keep a-cooling, baby
Uh, keep a-cooling, baby
Wah, waaah
