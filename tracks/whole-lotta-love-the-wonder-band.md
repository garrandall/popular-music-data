Tell you a story not a little white lie
Wasn't long tall sally it was no surprise
That's right - tell me that's right
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news
That night - tell me that's right
The band was singin' and playin' a tune
Love comes a-tumblin' down, oh yeah yeah

All shook up and bent out of shape
Wasn't johnny b. goode but it sounded great
That night - tell me that's right
From the cabaret to the highway of hell
Had a monkey on his back it was easy to tell
That night - tell me that's right
The band was singin' and playin' a tune
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah yeah

The band was singin' and playin' a tune
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah!

(v.o.) i'm wishing to live longer aided by the supreme healing force of music
It most definitely overcomes all weakening aspects of the body
I've felt quite lost and distraught without those wonderful vinyl productions
I'm convinced it's an addiction, too. i feel just great again
(band, get ready)

When you see the train come
Then you'll know what to do
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes
That's right - tell me that's right
(love came) a-stumblin' and a-tumblin' down
Not a pretty picture when the body was found
That night - tell me that's right

The band was singin' and playin' a tune
(love comes a-tumblin')
Tough act to follow not too good in your shoes
(love comes a-tumblin')
You see the train come you know what to do
(love comes a-tumblin')
Johnny b. goode it sounded just great
(love comes a-tumblin')
Long tall sally it was no surprise
(love comes a-tumblin')
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news
(love comes a-tumblin')
Not a pretty picture when the body was found
(love comes a tumblin')
Mama mama mama mama
