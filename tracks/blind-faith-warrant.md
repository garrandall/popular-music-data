Darlin' I know you're sleepin'
But there's something I've just got to say
Wonder if you'll hear me
While you're dreamin'
You make a lifetime
Out of every day
Thanks to you now I know
All my dreams can come true

Blind Faith in you
I got
Blind Faith in you oh yeah

Your eyes keep things well hidden
Just a hint of what
You're feelin' inside
And the first day that I met you
I consider that the first day of my life
Thanks to you now I know
All my dreams can come true

Blind Faith in you
I've got
Blind faith in you
And I'm not sure I deserve
A women so true, but I love
That you think I do

With You and Faith, beside me
I'm feelin' stronger every day

Blind faith in you
I got
Blind faith in you
It's true
Blind faith in you
I got
Blind faith in you
And I'm not sure I deserve
A woman so true but I love
That you think I do.
