You want my love and you can't deny
You know it's true, but you try to hide, yeah
You turn down love like it's really bad, ow
You can't give what you never had, yeah
Well, bless your soul, you can fool a few, ha ha
I know the truth now so do you, how how

You can't hide, I betcha, hoo
Betcha (Betcha)
Can't hide love, can't hide love
Well I betcha (girl, I betcha)
I can't hide, yeah (feel inside)

You can't pretend there's nothing there
Girl, I look in your eyes, I see you care
So why not stop trying to run and hide
You won't find out, if you never try

(You want my love, I betcha)
Ooooo, yeah, whoa, oh, whoa
(Hoo, betcha)

You want my love
Well, I betcha (girl, I betcha)
Whoa, oh, whoa, I've a feeling inside
(Feel inside)

Love has found the time for kissing, yeah
Can you find the time to listen
Life's found the time to want you, yeah
Can you find the time for blissing, yeah, how, how
