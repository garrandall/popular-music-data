Was it the pull of the moon now baby
That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy
I think it's something more
I've never felt the Earth move honey
Until you school my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ohyeah


We're hanging right on the edge now baby
The wind is getting stronger
We're hanging on by a thread now honey
We can't hold on much longer
It's a long way down but it's too late


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ohyeah


Oh baby I couldn't get any higher
This time I'm willing to dance on the wire
If I fall, If I fall


If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ohyeah


If I fall
If I fall
