I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching


And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try


Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl


I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving


And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I would not try


Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl




Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
