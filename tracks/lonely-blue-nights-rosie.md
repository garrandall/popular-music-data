Lonely blue nights, lonely, lonely blues
I can't hold you tight
I've got nothing to lose
For since you've been gone
All I have is lonely blue hoo hoo hoo hoo

My nights are filled with tears
My heart is filled with pain
I promise I'll be true
If you'll just come back again
For since you've been gone
All I have is lonely blue hoo hoo blues...

I'm sorry I hurt you, darling
I'll prove it to you someday
Regretting the things I've said, dear
That made you go away
And though you're far away
You might hear my cry
And come home someday
Forever to be mine

I'm sorry I hurt you, darling
I'll prove it to you someday
Regretting the things I've said, dear
That made you go away
For since you've been gone
All I have is lonely blues
Hoooo hoo hoo hoo hooo's whoo hooo

Whooo hooo hooo hooo...
