Heartbreak Suzie playing with my mind (ME CAN'T BELIEVE THE GIRL HAVE ME UNDER SO MUCH RAPS)
Heartbreak Suzie don't you waste my time (MAKE MY HEART A BEAT RAPID)
(SHAGS MAN AND THE GOLD MINE PON A DIFFERENT TIP)
Heartbreak Suzie playing with my mind (THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A DANCEHALL ROMANCE)
Heartbreak Suzie don't you waste my time (SHE HAVE ME IN A FANTASY ISLAND)

COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!

Wasn't it you who left me alone
Wasn't it you who called me on the phone
Wasn't it you who wrecked my home
Wasn't it you who wanted life alone
You must be crazy (YOU MUST HIM MOTTLE)
To still want to be my lady
You must be crazy (MM)
To still want to be my lady, hey

I KNOW NOW FI TELL HER SAY, HA

YOU SAID YOU WANTED A BREAK UP
YOUR LOVE WAS A FAKE
THERE WAS A MISTAKE MADE
YOU SAID YOU WANTED A BREAK UP
YOUR LOVE WAS A FAKE
THERE WAS A MISTAKE MADE

I REMINISCE ABOUT THE TIME WE HAD JUST ME AND YOU
AND HOW MUCH DAYS AND NIGHTS WE SPENT UPON THAT LONELY CRUISE
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE FOR ME I BET I COULD NOT LOSE
AND OUT OF MANY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN YOU ARE THE ONE I CHOOSE
TO LOVE AND HONOR AND PROTECT AND EVEN SAY "I DO"
BUT THEN YOU WANTED US TO PART AND THAT'S WHEN I REFUSED
BUT STILL YOU LEFT ANYWAY AND SUDDENLY I HAD THE BLUES
NOW HERE'S A THE PASS AND NO ONE ELSE COULD EVER FILL YOUR SHOES

You sending me up bringing me down got my head just spinning around
Come on in get on out baby why you wanna go that route

Say you must be crazy (HEY GIRL YOU MUST HAVE GIDDY)
To still want to be my lady, yeeeah (MR LOVER, COME BACK TO ME, HA)

NOTHING IN THIS WORLD COULD EXTINGUISH MY FLAMES
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I WANTED TO BARE MY NAME
ALL OF A SUDDEN I NOTICE YOU PLAYING MIND GAMES
GIVING ME MIGRAINE SO MUCH EMOTIONAL PAIN
YOU WERE THE ONE AND NO ONE ELSE COULD MAKE THAT CLAIM
IT'S A SHAME TO SEE THE RELATIONSHIP DOWN THE DRAIN
NOW YOU WANT US BACK TOGETHER AND IT WON'T BE THE SAME
WHAT YOUR AIM IS IT TO CAUSE ME MORE PAIN

Heartbreak Suzie playing with my mind (mm) (MMM)
Heartbreak Suzie don't you waste my time (YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME)
Heartbreak Suzie playing with my mind yey(STEP A FALL AND BEAT)
Heartbreak Suzie don't you waste my time

COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!
COME BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY BOOTY BY HAY!

Wasn't it you who left me alone 
Wasn't it you who called me on the phone
Wasn't it you who wrecked my home
Wasn't it you who wanted life alone
You must be crazy (GOT ME TURN ON THE SIDE YA SAY QUIETER)
To still want to be my lady
You must be crazy (SHE'S A NAUGHTY)
To still want to be my lady

HUH
RING A RING A ROSIE GAL A SO YOU BOISE
SWEETER THAN THAT NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND
NOW YOU COULD HAVE BROKEN MY HEART INNA SO MUCH SECTION
MASH ME UP UNTIL ME NEARLY TURN IN A MAD MAN
WALK AND KICK STONE AND TURN OVER RUBBISH PAN
NOW YOU WANT ME BACK I KNOW I'LL BE A SENSELESS MAN
NAW GO END UP INNA THE SAME SITUATION
GO TRY TO FIND ANOTHER GOON FI TURN IN A CARTOON
SO WHAT

YOU SAID YOU WANTED A BREAK UP (Heartbreak Suzie)
YOUR LOVE WAS A FAKE (you must be crazy)
THERE WAS A MISTAKE MADE (crazy crazy)
YOU SAID YOU WANTED A BREAK UP (Heartbreak Suzie)
YOUR LOVE WAS A FAKE (uh)
THERE WAS A MISTAKE MADE

Wasn't it you who left my home
Wasn't it you who wanted life alone (UH)
Wasn't it you who called me on the phone
Wasn't it you who wrecked my home

You must be crazy (CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GIRL)
To still want to be my lady (YOU KNOW WHAT I TELL ABOUT)
You must be crazy (SHE CAN NOT KISS)
To still want to be my lady (AN AMOUNT UP OF CASH A KNOCKED THE DOWN)
