Every time I hold you close to me
I don't mind tellin' everyone
It's plain to see
That I love you, yes I love you

Gonna tell the whole wild world
Baby you're so good to me
You're good to me

If you're feelin' lonely any night
Just keep thinking of our love
And you will be alright
'Cause I love you, yes I love you

Gonna tell the whole wild world
Baby you're so good to me
You're good to me

Each time that we're together
Everything is fine
I get this feeling inside of me
This feeling's that you are mine

Every time you kiss me tenderly
My heart keeps on saying
That you're the girl for me
And I love you, yes I love you

Gonna tell the whole wild world
Baby you're so good to me
You're good to me
Wow!

Each time that we're together
Everything is fine
I get this feeling inside of me
This feeling that you are mine

Every time you kiss me tenderly
My heart keeps on saying
That you're the girl for me
And I love you, yes I love you
I'm gonna tell the whole wild world
Baby you're so good to me, good to me
