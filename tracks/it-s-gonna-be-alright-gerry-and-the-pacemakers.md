It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

The day you came my way
I knew I would stay
Close by your side
To keep you staisfied

It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

When you look at me
In your eyes I can see
The love that grows each day
That's why I've gotta say

It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

Never thought I'd find a girl like you
Now I have, I know I'll never be blue
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

Every time we meet
My heart skips a beat
And now you're here to stay
You'll always hear me say

It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

Never thought I'd find a girl like you
Now I have, I know I'll never be blue
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right

Every time we meet
My heart skips a beat
And now you're here to stay
You'll always hear me say

It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
