Poor Otis dead and gone
Left me here to sing his song
Pretty little girl with the red dress on
Poor Otis dead and gone


Yeah, back down, turn around slowly
Try it again, remembering when
It was easy, try it again
Much too easy, remembering when


All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walking blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the running blues


Well, I've got the running blues
Running away, back to L.A
Got to find the dock of the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A


Running scared
Running blue
Goin' so fast
What'll I do


Well, I've got the running blues
Running away, back to L.A
Got to find the dock of the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A


All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walking blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the running blues
All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walking blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the running blues
