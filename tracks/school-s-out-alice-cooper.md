Hey Hey
Hey Hey
I guess I`m a loner and I don`t fit in (No...)
I ain`t too comfortable in my skin (No...)
An' I don`t play well with the others
I`m stuck somewhere between high school and old school
I can`t decide between my rules and your rules
Hey Hey
Hey Hey
Nobody wants me hanging round
Unless it`s from a tree in the middle of town
And I'm out of step with the others
I`m stuck somewhere between high school and old school
I can`t decide between my rules and your rules
I`m stuck somewhere between high school and old school
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules
My clothes don`t make me
My hair ain't cut right
And I don`t care much
No I don`t care at all
I guess my brain is out of synch, I think
I`m stuck somewhere between high school and old school
I can`t decide between my rules and your rules
I`m stuck somewhere between high school and old school
I can`t decide, I just can`t decide
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Aw...
