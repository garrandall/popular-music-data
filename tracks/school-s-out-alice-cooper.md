Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin all that noise
Cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag


School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces


No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks




Well we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes


School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces


No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks


Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all


School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely
