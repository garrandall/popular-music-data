When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me


Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got influence on me, can't comprehend
Oh no, next thing, you're on top of me
Okay with this, I call that a win-win


So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me


Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively


Who taught you how to drive stick?
You a fool with it, love the way you fool with it
And the way you motion, motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it


So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me


Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively


When I rise up, baby, don't shy up
Open your mind, don't knock it 'til you try it, darlin'
Show off when you come closer
Don't waste no time, love it when I'm in it, shawty


When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me


So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me
