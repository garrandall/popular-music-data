If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darlin'
Maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong, gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out that door, yeah
See if I care
Go on and go now

But don't turn around
'Cause your gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cry
Just walk away
It's tearin' me apart that you're leavin'
I'm lettin' you go
But I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holdin' me tight, so tight, real tight
If you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright
I'm gonna be strong, gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know I'll survive
I'll make it through
I'll even learn to live without you

But don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cry
Just walk away
It's tearin' me apart that your leavin'
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could cry out loud
That I love you, baby
I wish I could sing to you
Don't go, don't go, don't go

But don't turn around
'Cause your gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cry
Just walk away
It's tearin' me apart that you're leavin'
I'm letting you go

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cryin'
If you want to walk away, walk away babe
So, go on, go on, go on
Just don't turn around
Don't turn around
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that your leavin'
Diane Warren, Albert Hammond
