Happy days

Happy days

You're going away
Won't ask you to stay
Though this is the end
We're going to still be friends

Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)
Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)

Thank you for the picture
I'm smiling can't you see
Thanks for the lovely hours
You gave to me

Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)
Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)

I know my darling
You found someone new
But still my darling
I love only you

Goodbye, Goodbye
Though hard I've tried
All that's left for me to do
Is cherish memories of you

Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)
Happy happy days (happy days)
I wish for you (happy days)

So long bye bye
Though you broke my heart
So long bye bye
We're going to have to part
So long so long
Though you done me wrong
So long, goodbye
Though you made me cry
