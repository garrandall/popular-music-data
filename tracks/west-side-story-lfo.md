There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to look, time to care
Some day
Somewhere
We'll find a way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Somehow,
Some day,
Somewhere
