Man, I sure dig girls

I dig girls who wear a ponytail
Short fat fanny or as thin as a rail
Whoa, whoa, baby, I don't care
She can be a dream lover
Or a nightmare

The big or the small ones
The short or the tall ones
I dig girls, but oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I dig you

I dig girls from Tennessee
New York, Chicago
Or the mighty big beat

Whoa, whoa, baby
I'm telling you
A Tallahassee lassie
Or my Sioux City Sue

The young ones and old ones
The shy and the bold ones
I dig girls, but oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I dig you

I dig walking you in the park
I dig squeezing you in the dark
I dig shaking you every night
I don't feel right unless
I hold you tight

I'm like a Romeo
Looking for a Juliet
And I'm gonna find her
You can bet

Whoa, whoa, baby
I'm telling you
You bit of plain Jane
Or a Linda Lou

The good and the bad ones
The happy and the sad ones
I dig girls, but oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I dig you

I dig girls who wear a ponytail
Short fat fanny or as thin as a rail
Whoa, whoa, baby, I don't care
She can be a dream lover
Or a nightmare

The big or the small ones
The short or the tall ones
I dig girls, but oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I dig you
Yeah, I dig you

Oh, baby, I dig 'em all
Short ones, tall ones, skinny ones...
