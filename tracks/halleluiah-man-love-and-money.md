On the blind side and down the back ways
The roots of sadness crawl
When you can't get what you need
You feel like taking a torch to it all

All the sweet talk makes a bitter man
You can feel the darkness rise
Sometimes you don't know what you're fighting for
You don't know who it is you despise

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

In a coat of a thousand colours
And a star spangled Cadillac
He picked up a rodeo queen
With whiplash marks all over his back

When dreams don't become their people
People become their dreams
He didn't understand at the time
But now he knows exactly what it means

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

They said watch out boy be careful where you tread
You're throwing away all that beautiful bread
He slept outside until the world opened up
They've got to understand he's a Halleluiah Man

He says I am the Halleluiah Man
And I'll do anything to bring a government down

He built himself a prison
He knew he had to escape
Some worlds are held together by steel
Some worlds are held together by sellotape
He was drifting through the sharks teeth
He always paid his dues
When something told him he had nothing
That's when he knew he had nothing to lose

He says

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

When dreams don't become their people
People become their dreams
