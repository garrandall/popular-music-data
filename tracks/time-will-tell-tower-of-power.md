It's a rare occasion
When your plans and expectations
Come down just exactly how you planned them
Hey, life's just that way

You better face the facts, sweet lady
Things change from day to day
It all depends upon the situation
Who can say, any way?

Time will tell
Oh, and we'll both know so very well
Time will tell

So just be patient
Until you reach the realization
You can't have joy without a little sadness, too
That's just the way it is, hey

And girl, I believe we're gonna make it
But not without our share of ups and downs
You can't expect life to be a total paradise
But if we just pray together, girl, it will be so nice

Time will tell
Oh, and then we'll both know so very well
Time will tell, oh, baby

Oh, oh, girl
Take a little time out
And I'm sure that you will see, ah
You just keep on holdin' on, oh, love
You gon' be able to make it with me

Hey, oh, oh, baby
I need you, I want you, girl
I've got to have you, ah
Give me your time, just wait on me
Oh, girl, there's no tellin' how happy we gon' be
