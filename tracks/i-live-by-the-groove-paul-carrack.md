Hey 

Everybody loves to feel the beat 
From Malibu to 42nd Street 

I like to groove 
No matter where I am 
From Detroit City down to Alabama

It has moved me heart and soul 
So I do believe 
It's a whole philosophy to me 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can't feel it, baby 
I can't move 
I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can hear it, baby 
I can't lose 

A good groove will 
Turn your head around 
Lifts you up 
When you're feeling down 

Get your body moving into gear 
That's why the world's 
Been turning all these years 

It ain't written 
In the statute books 
It can't be learned in school 
It's the law, baby 
It's the golden rule 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can't feel it, baby 
I can't move 
I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can hear it, baby 
I can't lose 

All right 

It ain't written 
In the statute books 
It can't be learned in school 
It's the law, baby 
It's the golden rule 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 

Hey, hey, hey, hey 

I live by the groove 
If I can't feel it, baby 
I can't move 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can hear it, baby 
I can't lose 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 

I live by the groove 
I live by the groove 
If I can't feel it, baby 
I can't move 

Said I live by the groove 
I live by, live by 
Live by, live by the groove 

If I can't hear it 
I can't move 
I live by the groove 

If I can't feel it, baby 
I can't move...
