I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Whoah whoah whoah (whoah whoah)
Whoah whoah whoah


I can cast a spell
With secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
But anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly I will appear
Cause...


I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Whoah whoah whoah (whoah whoah)
Whoah whoah whoah


I can sense your needs
Like rain on to the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
That's what I've got plenty of
Cause...


I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Whoah whoah whoah (whoah whoah)
Whoah whoah whoah


I ain't braggin' cause I'm the one
You just ask me, and it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
Cause I've got it
Whoah whoah whoah (whoah whoah)
Whoah whoah whoah
Ah, ah, ah, ah


I'm every woman, I'm every woman
(Tell 'em all about it, child
Wanna really tell 'em all... about it)
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
(Want 'em to know, want 'em  to know that...)
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
