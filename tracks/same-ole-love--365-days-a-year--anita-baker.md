Flashbacks of the times we've had
Some made us laugh some made us sad
We used to break up to make up
All the fun that came from those love games
Oh well, I think I need someone new
Oh, it just won't do, because I think about you baby


From beginning to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ole' love
All I want to do is keep on loving you
I want your same ole' love

There's a reason I feel this way
All the things you do, well it might be the things that you say
Your love never changes
It's like a picture in a frame, and it remains the same

Your undying love for me
Oh it keeps me strong, keeps me holding on


From beginning to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ole' love, baby
All I want to do is share my life with you
I want your same ole' love

Slowly, love me
All is forsaken, I love the love we're making
Cause it's truly lovely
I'll never leave you, you'll know I need you baby


From beginning to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ole' love
All I want to do is share my life with you
I want your same ole' love
