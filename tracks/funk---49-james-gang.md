Sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's actin' right
You don't think it's showin'

J-J-Jumpin' up, fallin' down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think that I know your plan
What you tryna hand me?

Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna act that way
Ain't there's trouble brewin'
