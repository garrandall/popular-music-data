You are so special to me
It's got me going crazy
You don't know how I feel about you
It makes me do the things that I do girl

That's the way I feel
It mades me feel so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you laugh
It can make you cry
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you change
There's no one to blame
Makes ya go insane
That's the way love is

You gave me love, you game me joy
You were there through the thick and thin
I don't know what I'll do without you
You've been there for me, and I'll be there for you

That's the way I feel
It mades me feel so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you laugh
It can make you cry
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you change
There's no one to blame
Makes ya go insane
That's the way love is

It can make you laugh
It can make you cry
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you change
There's no one to blame
Makes ya go insane
That's the way love is

(That's the way it is
Baby, I'm a perfect match to attach
That's the way you work it
One hand washing the otherand your not)

(Watching another man and he's not watching
Some other woman
No need to let the tough times leave a frown
Erase your blue face now)

(Baby, you're with the Brown
He's here to take care of you like a doctor
Don't sweat, nothing Bob she got ya
That's the way love is)

It can make you laugh
It can make you cry
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is

It can make you change
There's no one to blame
Makes ya go insane
That's the way love is

It can make you laugh
It can make you cry
Feels so good inside
