Sometimes (Oh)
Something beautiful happens
In this world (Akon)
You don't know how to
Express yourself so (and Lonely Island)
You just gotta sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her
I just had sex
And I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex
Ways of the past

Have you ever had sex?
I have it felt great
It felt so good
When I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it
It literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice
Man out of the meanest

Never guess where I just came from
I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling
It was the best
When I had the sex
Man my penis felt great
And I called my parents
Right after I was done

Oh hey, didn't see you there
Guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed
Saw her boobies and the rest
Was sure nice of her to let you
Do that thing
Nice of any girl ever
Now sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world

To be honest I'm surprised
She even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense
But man, screw it
I ain't one to argue
With a good thing
She could be my wife
That good?
The best 30 seconds of my life (My life)

I'm so humbled by a girls ability
To let me do her
Cuz honestly I'd have sex
With a pile of manure
With that in mind
The soft, nice smelling girls better
Cuz she let me wear
My chain and turtle neck sweater

So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them
If you're near or far
Whether short or tall
We wanna thank you all
For letting us fuck you

She kept looking at her watch
(Doesn't matter, had sex)
But I cried the whole time
(Doesn't matter, had sex)
I think she might've been a racist
(Doesn't matter, had sex)
She put a bag on my head
(Still counts)

I just had sex (Sex)
And all my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you had sex in the last
30 minutes then you're qualified
To sing with me

I just had sex (Everybody sing)
And it felt so good (We all had sex)
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her (I wanna tell the world)
I just had sex
And I'll never go back (No no no)
To the not-having-sex
Ways of the past
