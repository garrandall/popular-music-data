I'd like to live out all my dreams
And if I could, yes if I could
The nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me
Don't you ever get lonely?

Lord, I'm no good when you're away
But what do you expect, from a girl
Who loves you like I love you
Won't you ever just get tired
And come on home to me?
Won't you ever get lonely?

You're a part of me
That I can't live without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you've never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
And take me away, take me away

Friends say it's great now you're a star
But what do they expect, from a girl
Who loves you just the way you are

Oh, and late at night
How I wish things had never changed
And you were here with me
Don't you ever get lonely?

You're a part of me
That I can't live without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you've never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
And take me away, take me away
And take me away, take me away
And take me away, take me away
And take me away, take me away
And take me away
