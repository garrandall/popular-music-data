Here comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby
For a while it was fun, we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby

See the rain in my eyes, baby
I never could stand goodbyes, baby
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain, could you, baby

Here comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby
For a while it was fun, we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain, could you, baby
