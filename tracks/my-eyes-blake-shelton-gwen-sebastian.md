Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, wanna drink 'em up
And keep on drinkin' 'til you make me drunk

Tied up hair, wanna let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can't beat the view

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But girl, my eyes ain't seen
Nothing quite like you, hey baby

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
