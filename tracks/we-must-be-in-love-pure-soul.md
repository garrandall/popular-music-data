Here we are together
In a place, in a space surrounded with love
Here to say
(Yes, I do)
I love you and I wanna be the only one
'Cause you, you are
(You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with)
I wanna spend the rest of my life
(You are just the one to bring out the very best in me)
You make me so happy
(You make me so happy)
Happy forever
(Happy forever)
And that's a mighty long time
We must be in
We must be in love
Yes, I've reconciled in my mind
That you are the only one for me
Yes, I've been around
And to this day, no one has made me as happy as you
Â€~Cause you are the one
(You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with)
I wanna spend the rest of my life
(You are just the one to bring out the very best in me)
You make me so happy
(You make me so happy)
Happy forever
(Happy forever)
And, oh that's a mighty long time, yeah
We must be in
We must be in love
Just let the love show, I'm pledgin' all my love
And this union that we have, we've got to make it last
It's me and you
(It's me and you)
And you and me
(And you and me)
We must
(Let's both take this, say you do)
You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with
You are the one, yeah
(You are just the one to bring out the very best in me)
I wanna feel you
(You make me so happy)
And I wanna be near you
(Happy forever)
We both go hand in hand
We are part of God's perfect plan
We must be in
We must be in love, oh
(I never thought, I'd find someone who loves me like you)
We must be in
We must be in love, oh
(Somethin' old, somethin' new)
(Somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue)
We must be in
(Oh, oh, oh)
We must be, oh
You
(You, you, you)
You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with
You are the one , yeah
(You are just the one to bring out the very best in me)
When I look into your pretty eyes
(You make me so happy ever)
I think of you then I smile
(Happy forever)
Now I know, yes I know, I will never let you go
We must be

Yeah

We must be in love, oh oh oh

We must in love, oh oh oh
We must be, yeah
