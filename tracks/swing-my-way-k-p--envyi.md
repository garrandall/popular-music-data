Oh, yeah, oh


Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way


I stepped off in a club on a Friday night
Lookin' for a man that would do me right
First move that I made was on the dancefloor
But got down one time, then I went down for mo'
Physical action was happenin' at
Saw this young playa dip through the crowd
Looked over to my left and told my girl, hey
If I see him again I'mma have to say
And I'mma have to say


Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Swing it over here shorty
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way


I got off the floor tryin' to find this man
Lookin' all around doing all I can, damn
He sure look (fine)
By the end of the night he's gonna be (mine)
I thought to myself he couldn't of gone far
Then I saw him again standing by the bar
So far everything is going my way
Now that I found him I'mma have to say


Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Swing it over here shorty
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way


Got to get up the nerve to get my swerve on
Gotta do it fast or he'll be gone
Cuz it'll be just my luck
That somebody else will scoop him up
Can't have that
Wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly
Got contact eye to eye
Then I walked over to him slowly
Said I know that you don't know me
But this might be my only shot at
A tenderoni
He told me that we can do this
Cuz a girl like you I can't resist
Got straight to the point, no time to play
Didn't need no game, just had to say


Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Swing it over here shorty
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way


I'll hold you tight
All through the night
Anything that you want
I'll keep it chrump
Boy you're gonna see
How good it can be
Just come to me
I'll
I'll hold you tight
All through the night
Anything that you want
I'll keep it chrump
Boy you're gonna see
How good it can be
Just come to me
I'll


Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way
Swing it over here shorty
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please

You're lookin' good shorty, good, sure 'nuff good enough for me
You're lookin' good shorty, good, sure 'nuff good enough for me
