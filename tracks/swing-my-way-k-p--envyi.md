I'll hold you tight, all through the night
Anything that you want, I'll keep it crump
Boy your gonna see, How good it can be
Just come to me, I'll...


Uh, shawty swing my way, you heard right
We was meant to be, like Mike and Ike
Bout to go in, like they turned on the street lights
Now we falling off, like when you first learned how to ride a bike
Now don't you cap like you forgot
I was the best blessing you got
Even your mama new that
And I know that, you want me back
It added up till we subtracted each other
Now I'm like what happened?
Things happen

Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here

Sitting back thinking got me reminiscing
You payed for everything, but never paid attention
Too just what I was missing we had different visions
The key in the ignition bout to start it where we ended
Guess I was tardy to the party
You pulled up on lil shawty, so I had to pull up on lil' shawty
I mean like, if you really loved me
Why you doing all of this to me?
I know what we could be, over here is where you should be


I'll hold you tight, all through the night
Anything that you want, I'll keep it crump
Boy your gonna see, How good it can be
Just come to me, I'll...


Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here

I know you thinking bout me and from time to time
I still cross your mind I hope you see the signs
If you ain't see me in your future than you must be blind
You must've lost your mind, well I'ma help you find - it
Hah, bring it over here bae
I ain't Michelle Obama but I am your First Lady
No steering wheel but you sure do be driving me crazy
What I got with you they hate it, let's let 'em hate bae

Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here
Bring it over here


I'll hold you tight, all through the night
Anything that you want, I'll keep it crump
Boy your gonna see, How good it can be
Just come to me, I'll...
