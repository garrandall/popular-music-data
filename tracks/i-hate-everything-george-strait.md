He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down
When he ordered up his third one he looked around
Then he looked at me, said I do believe I'll have one more
He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink
But on second thought tonight I think I hate everything

Then he opened up his bill-fold and threw a 20 down
And the faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
And I picked it up, he said thank you bud, I put it in his hand
He said I probably ought to throw this one away
'Cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything


I hate my job, I hate my life and if it weren't for my two kids I'd hate my ex-wife
I know I should move on and try to start again
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring and said I hate everything

He said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything



So I pulled out my phone and I called my house
I said babe I'm comin' home, we're gonna work this out
I paid for his drinks and I told him thanks, thanks for everything
