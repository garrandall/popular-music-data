With Mike 'The Hitman' Wilson

Walking around where you're the hero
Everyone who's in your life
Thinks so much of you

But friends don't mean
A whole lot to you, do they, boy
They're only fun?
Just part of the master play

Tried to move a little closer to your heart
But in your game, I always lose
Cause there's no getting close to you

Remembering times we were together
Feeling, oh, so safe and warm
Baby, in your arms

But you just took my love
And pushed me to the side
Thinking I'll be there for you
Like the other girls you used

I tried to move a little closer to your heart
But in your game, I always lose
Cause there's no getting close to you

I can't take another sleepless night
I can't take another sleepless night
