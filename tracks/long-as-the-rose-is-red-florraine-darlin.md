Inside my high school book
I placed the sweetest rose
It's right next to your name
And Heaven knows

()
Long as the rose is red
And skies are blue
You'll be my one true love
I'll go on loving you

I thought I'd lost your love
My letter set you free
But in my heart
I vowed eternally

()

Now that you're back, my love
I only hope and pray
That nothing in this world
Can take your love away

()

She's not my little girl
She only looks like me
Throw her a kiss and then
Pledge faithfully

Long as the rose is red
And skies are blue
I'll be your one true love
And God may bless us two

(Roses are red)
