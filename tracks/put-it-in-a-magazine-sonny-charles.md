It's just another night
Shining through
I've got to turn off the lights
I think I'm through

I'm all worn down
From my nine-to-five
It's heavy on me

And when I fall asleep
Dream about love, oh, baby

Here comes the dawn
And the dream is gone
But I keep on holding on

Gonna put it in a magazine
Tell the world
About my love for you
Gonna put it in a magazine
Just to prove that
My love is true

Still another day
Comes passing through
Don't want to make me stay
I've made plans with you

I'm gonna pick you up for dinner
A movie or a show
Don't matter what it is, girl
Just as long as you're gonna go

And when the evening's over
Finally take you home
Then you'll see my specialty
Is loving all night long, night long
All long, all long

Oh, baby, now I've made some plans
Darling, I want to be your man
Now then I hope you understand
Just mad about you

Oh, oh, and I spread the news
Gonna be one bout me and you
I thought I'd let you know
Before you read about it

Gonna put it in a magazine
Tell the world
About my love for you
Baby, baby, baby

Gonna put it in a magazine
Just to prove it
That my love is true

Hey, baby, baby
Gonna put it in a magazine
Tell the world you made
My dreams come true

You know you did, baby
Put it in a magazine
I want the world to know
My love is true

Oh, babe
Put it in a magazine
I want the world to know
My love is so true, yeah

Gonna put it in a magazine
Tell the world my love is
Good for you, now, baby

Gonna put it in a magazine
I want the world
To know you're mine
I'm gonna put it in Time

Baby, hey, hey
Baby, in a magazine
I want the world to know
My love is true now, baby

I, I, I
Gonna put it in a magazine
Hey, hey, baby
Gonna put it in a magazine, yeah

I want the world to know
That I love you so
That's why I'm gonna
Put it in a magazine...
