(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom)

I have a boyfriend
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
Met him a week ago
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
He's my forever
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
Last night he told me so

He's the boy that I adore
Never felt like this before
And I know I'll never let him go

I have a boyfriend
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom)
(Whoo-ee-whoo)
We'll never say goodbye
(Boom-sh-boom)
(Boom-sh-boom)
He made a promise
(Boom)
(Whoo-ee-whoo)
He'll never make me cry
(Boom-sh-boom)

Every time we kiss goodnight
Feels so good to hold him tight
And I thank the stars
Up in the sky

(And someday I know) oh-oh, yeah
(We'll walk down the aisle)
Yes, we will (so much in love)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (wearing a smile)

Every time we kiss goodnight
Feels so good to hold him tight
Oh-oh, I'm so glad I have a boyfriend

I have a boyfriend
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I have a boyfriend, yeah, I do
