Mmm, oh
Yeah, yeah


I've been waiting all day here for ya babe
So won't you come and sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together, always?
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever


(I never thought that anyone)
Could make me feel this way, oh
(Now that you're here, boy, all I want)
Is just a chance to say


Get out (leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her (who?) and I wonder (why?)
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)


Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone


(So now after all is said and done)
Maybe I'm the one to blame, but
(To think that you could be the one)
Well, it didn't work out that way


Get out (leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone (You to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (Who?) and I wonder (why?)
How I bought all the lies (All of the lies that you...)
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (Waste of time)


I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice you've gotta leave
Because my heart is breakin'
With every word I'm sayin'
I gave up everything I had
On somethin' that just wouldn't last
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes
Oh, oh
Get out!


Get out (Leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me (You and me)
It's too late (Now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone (You to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (Who?) and I wonder (Why?)
How I bought all the lies (How did I buy all the lies?)
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (Waste of time) (Oh)


Get out (Leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me (Hey, yeah!)
It's too late (Now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone (You to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (Who?) and I wonder (Why?)
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right (Treat me right)
But you was just a waste of time (Waste of time) (Oh, yeah)


Get out (Leave!)
You and me
It's too late (Now!) (Too late!)
You
'Bout her (Who? Why?)
You said that you would treat me right (No)
But you was just a waste of time (Waste of time)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
