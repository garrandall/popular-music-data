Silver moon
Shining on my bed
Beside my pillow
Light the pathway
To bring that man
To me

Something tells me
My words
Are goin' straight
To his heart
And oh
Somethin' tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinkin' of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it goin'
You turn me on
Baby, come to me

Know a secret
How to make you want me
How to make you love me
Whoa
Sure
As there's a moon above
It's a friend of mine
It still makes you burn

Said, oh oh
Something tells me
The fires
Goin' right up
Your spine
Whoa, oh
Somethin' tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinkin' of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it goin'
You're turnin' me on

Baby, come to me
Said I love you
Thinkin' of you
Oh, whoa
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you, yeah
Got it goin'
You're turnin' me on

Baby, come to me
Whoa, yeah

Come on, baby
You know what I want
Listen
Come on closer
Go 'head

Oh, oh
Something's
Tellin' me, yeah
The fire's
Goin' right up
Your spine
And oh oh
Something's tells me
Yeah
You'll be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinkin' of you
Oh, oh, yeah
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it goin'
You're turnin' me on

Baby, come to me

Sweet baby
Come to me now
(Come on home to me, baby)

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you

Oh, baby, I need you
(Shining over you)
Sweet baby
Come to me now
(Me and you, oh)

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you
(Oh)
Oh, baby, I need you
Sweet baby
Come to me now
(Baby, why don't you
come on home to me)
