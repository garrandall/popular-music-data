There you were, standing there, smiling as you made your plan
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
And that's the very same thing you once told to me

And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you?
To me it means the world but youve torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart

There you were, standing there, smiling as you made your plan
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
And that's the very same thing you once told to me

And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you?
To me it means the world but youve torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart

So take my little golden band from your hand
My little band of gold means nothing to you
To me it meant the world but youve torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
