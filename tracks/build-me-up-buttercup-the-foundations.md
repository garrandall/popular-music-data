Why do you build me up Buttercup baby just to let me down and mess me around
And then worst of all you never call baby when you say you will but I love you still
I need you more than anyone darlin', you know that I have from the start
So build me up Buttercup. Don't break my heart


I'll be over at ten, you tell me time and again but you're late. I wait around and then
I went to the door and I can't take no more but it's not you. You let me down again


Baby Baby try to find a little time and I'll make you happy
I'll be home waiting beside the phone waiting for you.


Why do you build me up Buttercup baby just to let me down and mess me around
And then worst of all you never call baby when you say you will but I love you still
I need you more than anyone darlin', you know that I have from the start
So build me up Buttercup. Don't break my heart


To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you adore, if you'd just let me know
Although you're untrue I'm attracted to you all the more. Why do I need you so?


Baby Baby try to find a little time and I'll make you happy
I'll be home waiting beside the phone waiting for you. Ohhhhhh


Why do you build me up Buttercup baby just to let me down and mess me around
And then worst of all you never call baby when you say you will but I love you still
I need you more than anyone darlin', you know that I have from the start
So build me up Buttercup. Don't break my heart
