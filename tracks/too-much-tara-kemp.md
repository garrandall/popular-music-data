Too much for us to hold on to
In a world where we can't be
Just me and you

Too much, it's more than I can bear
In a world where love and war
Have to be compared

In some ancient past
Love was all there was
But in modern life
We're condemned to strife
No time for love

This love affair was heaven made
You're a pagan god and I'm passion slave
But we're captured here in this world of hate
Where no one wins and no one relates

There will be a day
When we can play in a sea of blue
But now we are here
And all that we fear
Is coming true

This love affair was meant to be
When you are here you're all that I see
But we can't ignore what life has in store
For those less fortunate than we

There will be a day
When we can play in a sea of blue
But now we are here
And all that we fear
Is coming true

It's too much for me and you
U know what we have to do
It's too late to hesitate
We've got to turn this world hate
Into love
