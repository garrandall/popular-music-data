Can you ride the rhythm of this human wave?
Caught up in the music and the space you save

Caught up in the magic of it
Caught up in the madness

Sometimes you scare yourself
You're so strong

You're so tough
Can you feel the fire pumping through your veins?
You try to get up and here it comes again

Right down to the basics of it
Right down to the wire

So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack

Hold on
Come back
Oh yeah, it's just that easy
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack

Hold on
Come back
Oh yeah, it's just that easy

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Let the walls come down

Surrender your wings before they lift you off the ground

Surrender for every reason
Surrender yourself

Sometimes you go so far
You're so hot
You can't stop
Can you make it last
Make it rock to the bone?
If you do it faster will the hunger drive you home?
Right down to the basics of it
Right down to the wire
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack

Can you ride the rhythm of this human wave?
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
