I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You'd better stop the things you do
I tell you, I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it cause you put me down
Oh no

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it cause you put me down
Oh oh

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Oh yeah
