Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away, Dixieland

Sing it, fellas.

Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland 
I'll take my stand 
To live and die in Dixie

For Dixieland I was born
Early Lord one frosty morn'
Look away, look away, look away, Dixieland

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

So hush, little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord, soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
