Baby (baby)
You're driving me crazy
(Right out of my head)

I say, baby (baby)
You're driving me crazy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You got a brand new
Lover for yourself
You went and put your
Number one lover on the shelf

Baby (baby)
You're driving me crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I said, lover (lover)
There isn't any other
No, no, no, no

I said, lover (lover)
There is no other
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get ahold of yourself
Gonna lose control
Gonna find you had a lover
With lots of soul

Say, baby (baby)
You're driving me crazy

You got a whole lotta
Fellas out on the street
Smile on your face for
Every fella you meet

Lips of a-wine
I say you're so fine
You're bout to make me
Lose my mind

I said, baby, yeah
You're driving me crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I say, baby (baby)
You're driving me crazy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You got a brand new
Lover for yourself
You went and put your
Number one lover on the shelf

I say, baby, yeah
You're driving me crazy

Yeah, I'm out of my mind
You got to be there
You know I've lost control
You got to be there

You got to be there
Yeah, I've lost my mind...
