I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that guy's got into your blood
Go out and get him
If you want him to be
The very part of you
Make you want to breathe
Here's the thing to do


Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now


I know something about love, you gotta show it and
Make him see the moon up above
Go out and get him
If you want him to be always by your side
If you want him to only think of you


Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now


Ever since the world began, it's been that way for man
And women were created to make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated, oh yeah?


I know something about love
You gotta take his hand
Show him what the world is made of
One kiss will prove it
If you want him to be always by your side
Take his hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride


Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now
Oh, you have to go now
(Tell him that you're never gonna leave him) oh, yeah
(Tell him that you're always gonna love him) yeah
(Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now)
Don't you let him go, now
(Tell him that you're never gonna leave him) oh, yeah
(Tell him that you're always gonna love him) yeah
(Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now)


Just take his hand in yours and tell him
