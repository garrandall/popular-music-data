Ooh, the storm is threatnin'
My very life today
If I don't get me no shelter
I think I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away (Yeah)

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
My very street today
Somebody oughta gimme some shelter
Or I think I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, just one shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, just one shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, yeah yeah

Mmm, the floods is threatnin'
My very life today
Gimme, why don't you gimme some shelter
Or I think I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Shot away
Shot away

It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away

Why don't you stop that shootin'
Why don't you stop that shootin'
Oh, children
Together now
