We use to talk forever on a dime
Now we live together, never find the time
We use to walk as lovers on the sand
Now we`re working full time on our lifetime plan
We never stop to see the moon at night
We`re just too busy leading complicated lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember holding you so tight
Oh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Look at us now weÂ’re all grown up, we got it all together
Got it all sown up, but is this all, it all was leading to
Do we just run out of dreams when all our dreams come true
What ever happened to those endless nights
When we were happy living young and foolish lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember holding you so tight
Oh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(sax solo)
Whoa oh oh, whoa
We never stop to see the moon at night (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
We`re just too busy leading complicated lives
Whoa, whoa...Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember holding you so tight
Oh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember living on a big road stop
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember holding you so tight
Oh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoo, baby leave me on a rooftop
I remember love on a rooftop
(I remember living on a big road stop)
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
I remember holding you so tight
Oh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
