Yeah, Ideal
Y-2-Kay Gee and R.L. collabo'
Uh-oh
Make 'em, make 'em, make 'em dance to this
Uh, yeah, Ideal, come on
Make 'em, make 'em, make 'em dance to this
Let's go

Whatever you wanna do, uh-uh
Whether it's at the crib or club, uh-huh
It's all up to you, what-what
Whatever you wanna do

So you wanna groove, uh-uh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What you gonna do, what-what
'Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

Tonight you're with me
I'm talkin' VIP
Cristal, Mo?t, Dom P. tonight, oh
Nice suite at the Double Tree
You and me in between the sheets
It's whatever you like, baby, tell me

{I like when you move up close to me}
{Sexy grindin', holdin' me}
{Real close 'cause you're supposed to be, baby}
I like it when you put that thing on me
Pushin' it up against the jeans
Makin' it harder in between, baby

Whatever you wanna do, uh-uh
Whether it's at the crib or club (Yeah, yeah, yeah), uh-huh
It's all up to you (What-what), what-what
Whatever you wanna do

So you wanna groove (Oh), uh-huh
Show me how you move (Oh, oh), uh-huh
What you gonna do (Yeah), what-what
'Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

Tonight I just got paid
Let's hop in the Escalade
Go out on an escapade tonight, alright
What sip you choose
I'll grab your hips and move
And do whatever you like, tell me, tell me

{I like when you move up close to me
{Sexy grindin', holdin' me}
{Real close 'cause you're supposed to be, baby}
I like it when you put that thing on me
Pushin' it up against the jeans
Makin' it harder in between (Baby)

Whatever you wanna do, uh-uh
Whether it's at the crib or club (Oh, ho), uh-huh
It's all up to you (What-what), what-what
Whatever you wanna do (And whatever you want)

So you wanna groove, uh-uh
Show me how you move (Oh, oh), uh-huh
What you gonna do (What-what), what-what
'Cause I wanna rock with you (Yeah)
Whatever you wanna do

You could choose the place we go
Or stay home with the stereo (Oh, oh)
You choose the scenario
Tonight (Come on, come on, come on, come on)

Tonight your situation (Yeah)
Here's your invitation
Come with me (Come and go with me)

Whatever you wanna do
Whatever you wanna do (Oh, no), uh-uh
Whether it's at the crib or club (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), uh-huh
It's all up to you, what-what
Whatever you wanna do (Whatever, whatever, whatever)

So you wanna groove, uh-uh
Show me how you move (Oh, oh), uh-huh
What you gonna do (What-what), what-what
'Cause I wanna rock with you (Yeah, yeah)
Whatever you wanna do

Come on, show me how you move
Baby, let me see you groove
We can do what you want to
Tonight

You can move across to me
You can say, "Come on, mami"
You can say, "Come on, papi"
Tonight

Whatever you wanna do (Whatever you wanna do), uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club (I'll give it to you), uh-huh
It's all up to you (Whatever you need), what-what
Whatever you wanna do (I'll do it for you)

So you wanna groove (Whatever you want), uh-huh
Show me how you move (I'll give it to you), uh-huh
What you gonna do (Whatever you want), what-what
'Cause I wanna rock with you (I'll give it to you)
Whatever you wanna do
