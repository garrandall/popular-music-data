Hmm-mmm-mmm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time


Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight (Hmm-mmm-mmm)
'Cause it's always a good time
Slept in all my clothes, like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time


Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time (Woo!)


Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
(Good time, good time, it's always a good time)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)


Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out, if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time


Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time (Woo!)


Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time


Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there
Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
(It's always a good time!)


Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (Doesn't matter where), whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (Doesn't matter where)
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time


Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
