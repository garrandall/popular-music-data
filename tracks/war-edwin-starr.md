War, huh, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, uh-huh, uh-huh

War, huh, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again, y'all

War, huh, good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

Oh war, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, huh, good god, y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again

War, huh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh, Lord
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreak
War, friend only to the undertaker

Oh, war, is an enemy to all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest within the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?

Oh, war, huh, good god, y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it

War, huh, uh-huh, yeah, uh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War, it got one friend, that's the undertaker

Oh, war has shattered many a young man's dreams
Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to spend fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away

Oh, war, huh, good god, y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again

War, huh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh, Lord
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War, friend only to the undertaker

Peace, love and understanding, tell me
Is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But lord knows there's got to be a better way

Oh, war, huh, good god, y'all
What is it good for?
You tell me, (nothing) say it, say it, say it, say it

War, huh, good god, yeah, huh
What is it good for?
Stand up and shout it (nothing)
