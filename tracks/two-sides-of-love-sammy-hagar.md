You never hear about it
It's not the thing you talk over with friends
You never see it coming until it begins

But something stepped in between us
It's taken all of our time alone
In her heart love remains, but is seldom shown

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

A kiss goodbye, a kiss hello 
You wonder why she get's lonely
You've got to show her, don't tell her
She's your one and only, yeah

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

We make promises, promises
And late at night you make big plans
Someday we'll run away and leave the love demands, yeah

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

Two sides of love 
Two sides of love 
Two sides of love 
Two sides of love
