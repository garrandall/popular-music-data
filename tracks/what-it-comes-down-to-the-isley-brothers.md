Here I am lovin' you
You're like a dream come true
For so long I've waited for this time
Girl what you mean to me
In reality, you what I ever hoped for
You will always be
More than right for me
Each day I love you more
Well, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Yeah, same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Why do we stay together
Talkin' about you and me'
You got your reasons
I got mine
Oh, if it had to be, one and only me
Sure would be a drag now
Need somebody who, needs somebody to
Keep from bein' sad now
Well, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Ah, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Well, what it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
