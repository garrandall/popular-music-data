I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you


Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feeling so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
Sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freek'n you is all I need


Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you


What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you


Oh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last cause I'm a freak
Turned on by everything you say
I'm turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you


Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you


What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you


Freek out and freek me up and down
DeVante Swing
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down


Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight
Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight


What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
