Get up on it

Let's do it
That's nice
I like it


That's the way it has to be
Cause that's the way I like it
That's the way it has to be
Cause that's the way I like it


You told me that you loved me
Now, girl
Show me
Cause I can't believe it's true
By the things you do

Never have I ever
Had such pleasure
Of giving up my love this way
I want you every day


Take me by the hand
I will be your man
Cause that's the way you make me feel

Take me by surprise
Look into my eyes
And show me that your love is real



Yeah, yeah, yeah

(I like it)
Uh huh, uh huh
(I like it)
Uh huh
(Uh)


Let's wine and dine
And just take our time
The night is young and so are we
Just come with me

We'll walk in the park
And kiss in the dark, girl
Cause that's the things I like to do
When I'm with you

Take me by the hand
I will be your man
Cause that's the way you make me feel

Take me by surprise
Look into my eyes
And show me that your love is real



Uh, I like it

Let's do it

People, clap your hands
If you like it

Stop
This is what I like


Your hair so wild
Sunglasses and that smile
That's the way
Uh, huh
That's the way
Now dance

I like it nasty
(Uh)

Every time I'm with you
I just want to kiss you
Yeah, yeah

Girl, you make me feel good
The time is right
I wish you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah
