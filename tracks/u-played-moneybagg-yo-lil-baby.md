How a nigga sayin' they gon' ride for me?
Really don't give no fucks 'bout who gon' ride for me
'Cause I'ma ride for me
Let you have it, it's gon' be a homicide 'bout me

Surrounded by this fake love
What's that? it's bad blood
How you with me when you fuck with bruh
What's that? that's bad blood
How you cross me, we come out the mud
What's that? that's bad blood
Snake shit for a stamp, that's bad blood in the camp
She ain't got shit, you gotta buy her love
What's that? that's bad blood
She gon' fuck off, holdin' on a grudge
What's that? that's bad blood
Lay up with you plottin' to set you up
What's that? that's bad blood
Gotta stay on your toes, it's bad blood with these hoes

I ain't just rappin', I don't do no cappin' and I won't sugarcoat what happened
Came to you like the man I am, I never told Gotti what happened
Texted and called and you ain't respond
Seen too much, I don't play with guns
Tried to nip it in the bud, bad blood is what it was
I'm poppin' meds like crazy ('bout you)
I'm lettin' certain shit faze me ('bout you)
I'm readin' shit on the blogs (what?)
Like what happened with you and your dog (dang)
Can't believe it came to this here (things changed)
Really thought shit was sincere (I did)
Let a big hater get in your ear (big bitch)
It could've been our year (true story)
Saw Courtney with you at Icebox
I approached him, tryna smack him
You jumped in the way of my action (why you do that?)
I couldn't take your reaction (fucked me up)
I treated you like a lil brother, I'm big brother
Look at us now, this shit crazy (crazy)
Could've been on tour gettin' hella guap
I really thought we was fed babies (shit crazy)

Surrounded by this fake love
What's that? it's bad blood
How you with me when you fuck with bruh
What's that? that's bad blood
How you cross me, we come out the mud
What's that? that's bad blood
Snake shit for a stamp, that's bad blood in the camp
She ain't got shit, you gotta buy her love
What's that? that's bad blood
She gon' fuck off, holdin' on a grudge
What's that? that's bad blood
Lay up with you plottin' to set you up
What's that? that's bad blood
Gotta stay on your toes, it's bad blood with these hoes

You told me secrets I won't speak on and I never ever will
Copped that Michael Myers chain because you gave me that idea
Shit was so real on my end though, I treated you like my kinfolks
Got you monkey, I'm GP, still Lil JoJo and 3Three
(And I'ma leave it at that, maybe one day we could
Laugh and talk that shit out but until then I'ma drop the situation)
Watch what you say 'round these hoes, 'cause they cross shit up (what happened?)
Have a nigga at your neck tryna box you up (God damn)
All this hate comin' from every angle (every way), where the love?
No offense to all you bitches (why you say that?), you hard to trust
I'm too heartless, I don't care about choice, I don't give no fucks
You don't love me, that shit lust
You might throw me under the bus, yeah

Surrounded by this fake love
What's that? it's bad blood
How you with me when you fuck with bruh
What's that? that's bad blood
How you cross me, we come out the mud
What's that? that's bad blood
Snake shit for a stamp, that's bad blood in the camp
She ain't got shit, you gotta buy her love
What's that? that's bad blood
She gon' fuck off, holdin' on a grudge
What's that? that's bad blood
Lay up with you plottin' to set you up
What's that? that's bad blood
Gotta stay on your toes, it's bad blood with these hoes

How a nigga sayin' they gon' ride for me?
Really don't give no fucks 'bout who gon' ride for me
'Cause I'ma ride for me
Let you have it, it's gon' be a homicide 'bout me
