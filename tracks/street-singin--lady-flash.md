Yeah, you're a down and dirty blues man 
Look-a-here 
You play blues on blue guitar 
According to the news man 
As far as blues goes you a star 
I'll admit you gettin' down there 
But I'm down much deeper then you are 

Yeah, you sing those songs of sorrow 
But to me you just don't sound real 
You say you're down enough to borrow 
I must be down enough to steal 
Now the blues ain't what you're singin' 
The blues is what I feel 

You tell me your love light is dimmin' 
And how your old lady cheats 
You go backstage with all the women 
While I go back out on the street 

Well, you know that you're a winnner 
And you tell me you were born to lose 
But please, please, please, don't tell me about the blues 

You tell it like you're barefoot 
And you're wearin' those hundred dollar shoes 
Yeah, you can shuck and jive me all you wanna 
But please, please don't tell me about the blues 

Yeah, you tell me you a poor man 
While you flashin' those ruby rings 
But on a million dollar tour 
Man, you can flash more than a goddamn thing 
But it's me who's payin' my dues 
So please, man, don't tell me about the blues
