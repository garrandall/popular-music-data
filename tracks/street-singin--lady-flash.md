Well, well, well
Here we are
Me and you
Shoop shoop
Me and you
Well, well, well
Singing like we used to do
Do wah ditty ditty

Do you remember the sweet sounds
Do you remember the good times
Do you remember how it
Used to be so fine (so fine)
You forget about the time

When we were street singing
We were beauties in the night
We were sweet street singing

With the future looking bright
I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life

Hey, hey, hey
Sure and we was nobody`s fool
No, no, nobody`s fool
Hey, hey, hey
Always playing super cool
Supe, supe, super cool

Do you remember the old days
Singing down in the subways
Do you remember
How we used to sound so fine (so fine)
And we didn`t have a dime

When we were street singing
We were beauties in the night
We were sweet street singing

With the future looking bright
I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life

Do lang, do lang, do lang
Shoo bop, shoo bop
Do lang, do lang, do lang
Shoo bop, shoo bop
Do lang, do lang, do lang

I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life

Oh, remember, oh

Street singing
Street singing
Street singing, do lang, do lang
Do lang, do lang, do lang

Street singing
Street singing
Street singing, papa oom mow mow
Papa oom mow mow
