Curtain going up-up-up - curtain going up-up-up

Walking along the street last night, I happened to see you within
You went into a picture show - the drama was about to begin
Followed you inside, didn't try to hide

The lights were down, you took his hand and when the movie star-arted
You moved right in so close to him - it left me broken hear-eart brea-ea-ea-eak

I caught your act, oh I saw what you did girl
I caught your act, caught your act baby
I saw the whole thing, you got carr-arried away
It was easy to see-ee, there was no part for me

Oh-oh, I caught your act, oh I saw what you did girl
I caught your act, caught your act baby
(Caught your act, caught your act baby)
And I got caught in the dark

Curtain going up-up-up
Caught you baby, yes I did, he was holdin' you in his arms, yeah
Curtain going up-up-up - one night stand with your thievin' man
Curtain going up-up-up - did he buy popcorn, did he buy candy
Why'd you ever get together

When you played those long love scenes your kisses failed to show
I had the best seat in the house
And when the lights came on you were the first one to know

Oh-oh, I caught your act, oh I saw what you did girl
I caught your act, caught your act baby
I saw the whole thing, you got carr-arried away
It was easy to see-ee, there was no part for me

Oh-oh, I caught your act, oh I saw what you did girl
I caught your act, caught your act baby
(Caught your act, caught your act baby)
And I got caught in the dark

Curtain going up-up-up - followed you inside, didn't try to hide
Caught you baby, yes I did, he was holdin' you in his arms, yeah
Curtain going up-up-up - followed you inside, didn't try to
