DJ Esco, Lil Uzi Vert, Future
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce


Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Hermes in the A, that's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous, I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now, that's too much sauce
That's too much sauce, got too much sauce
That's too much sauce, I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all on my fingers, that's too much sauce


Yeah, all of my diamonds they shine
Haters like "knock that off"
Yeah, all of your diamonds are fake
Need to stop that dawg
You really kissin' that girl like she ain't top me though
Shaquille O'Neal with the haters cause I'm blockin' y'all
Yeah, yeah, that's too much sauce
Rockin' VLONE when I'm rockin' Off-White
That's too much sauce
Yeah, she smile at me on her teeth with that ice
That's too much sauce
Yeah, smokin' that gas got me high like a kite
Yeah, yeah, too much sauce, yeah, yeah
Diamonds they look like Dasani huh, more like Voss, aye
Yeah, that boy saw my chain, he said "what's the cost?", aye
You wanna know the amount? Can you count?


Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Hermes in the A, that's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous, I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now, that's too much sauce
That's too much sauce, got too much sauce
That's too much sauce, I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all of my fingers, that's too much sauce


Yeah, too much sauce, yeah, yeah
Diamonds they look like the Dasani, more like Voss
Young man, young man
Young man turned myself right to a boss like yeah
Coppin' no matter the cost, like yeah
That's too much sauce
Fuck that bitch and her friend right in my Benz
Too much sauce
Think me and Future fucked on the same twins
Damn, yeah, yeah
Now I'm getting money
Niggas actin' like they been knew us, aye
Fake energy don't move us, yeah, aye
Diamonds they wide like a cougar
Diamonds they straight from the jeweler
Drugs got me lost like Bermuda


Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Hermes in the A, that's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous, I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now, that's too much sauce
That's too much sauce, got too much sauce
That's too much sauce, I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one, that's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all of my fingers, that's too much sauce


Too much sauce, yeah, yeah
Diamonds they look like Dasani
