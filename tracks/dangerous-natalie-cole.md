Da, da, da, da, da, da, dangerous
Da, da, da, danger, dangerous

All my friends say he's much too hot
Don't get involved, it's emotional shock
But ooh, he charges my electricity
When he puts his finger on me

I said a oh, oh, oh, you know I want you and I
And I, and I need you pretty baby
I'm in the fire, there's just no turning back
Though I know, know, know

You're dangerous
So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
Ooh, dangerous
I feel my heart beat, I feel it beating faster

Ooh, ooh, too dangerous
The way you kiss me, I know I never felt like this
Oh, you're dangerous
Wild, even stranger, need a little danger

You make your move and I'm begging please
Then you're pushing me away, you know you're such a tease
One look can drive me right out of my mind
And get my heart pumping double time

And then I hear myself say you better be strong
Stay away, he's gonna do wrong
You better run girl while you've got the chance
'Cause you know, know, know

He's dangerous
So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
Ooh, dangerous
I feel my heart beat, I feel it beating faster

Ooh, ooh too dangerous
The way you kiss me, I never, ever felt like this
Oh, you're dangerous
Wild, even stranger, need a little of your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh

I'm in too deep and when you're close to me
I get so weak
Our bodies touch and then our hearts collide
I feel inside, emotional love exploding

Oh, dangerous
So hot and heavy I know that I just can't resist this
Ooh, dangerous
I feel my heart beat, beating a little bit faster

Ooh, ooh too dangerous
The way you kiss me, I never, ever felt like this
Oh, you're dangerous
Wild, even stranger, need a little danger
