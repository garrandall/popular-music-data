They say all the pretty girls
Come from Louisville
(No, no, they come from Memphis)
And all the sweet girls
Come from Baltimore
(Uh, uh, they come from Memphis)

M-e-m-p-h-i-s
That's Memphis, Tennessee

I hear all the cool girls
Come from Chicago
(No, no, they come from Memphis)
And all the movie stars
Come from Hollywood
(Oh, yeah, but they
Were born in Memphis)

M-e-m-p-h-i-s
That's Memphis, Tennessee

Well, if you don't believe
Just take a little trip
Down the Big Muddy
The mighty Missisip

Take a look around
That happy little town
If you're looking for a little girl
You'll find her in

M-e-m-p-h-i-s
That's Memphis, Tennessee
Oh, yeah

Well, if you don't believe
Just take a little trip
Down the Big Muddy
The mighty Missisip

Take a look around
That happy little town
If you're looking for a little girl
You'll find her in

M-e-m-p-h-i-s
That's Memphis, Tennessee

Well, I believe
San Francisco
(No, no, Memphis)
Philadelphia
(Uh, uh, Memphis)

St. Louis
(Aw, Memphis)
New York City
(Come on now, Memphis)

Washington
(No, Memphis)
