'm getting outta here cause there's too many complications
Yeah I'm getting outta here don't get driven any information
And if they ask you for a number to call just say I'm gone that's all 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, Destination unknown 

If anybody wants me just say you don't know the address
Cause I've had enough of the confusion and the madness
And should anybody ever try to stall, just say I'm gone that's all 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, Destination unknown 

I'm tired of playing other peoples games
Tired of waiting for some things to change 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, Destination unknown 

I'm tired of playing other peoples games
Tired of waiting for some things to change 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, Destination unknown 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, Destination unknown 

Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home 
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
