(Somebody)
Told her that there was a place like Heaven
'Cross the water on a 747
Yeah we're living in
In a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
And pretty soon she'd really got the notion
Of flying out across the big blue ocean
Yeah we're living in
In a modern world

Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is (static)
Information, I'm still here
Redial on automatic

Calling America
Can't get a message through
Calling America
That's what she said to do
Calling America
That's where she has to be
Calling America
She left a number for me

But I'm just talking to a satellite
Twenty-thousand miles up in the sky each night
Yeah we're living in
In a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
All I had to do was pick up the phone
I'm out in space trying to talk to someone
Yeah we're living in
In a modern world

She left a number I could call
But no one's there, no one at all
There must be something going wrong
That number just rings on and on

Calling America
Can't get a message through
Calling America
That's what she said to do
Calling America
That's where she has to be
Calling America
She left a number for me

Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while
Guess she's missing me across the miles
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

Calling America
Can't get a message through
Calling America
That's what she said to do
Calling America
That's where she has to be
Calling America
She left a number for me

Calling America, Calling America
