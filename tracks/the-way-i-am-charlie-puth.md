Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide (Oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try


And that's okay
I promise myself one day
(Hey!)


I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am


That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am


Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (Oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before (It was nothing like before)
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (Surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure


And that's okay
(Baby, now, that's okay)
I promise myself one day
(Hey!)


I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am


That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am


I'ma tell 'em all (That's just the way I am)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
(That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am


Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along


Everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide


I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am


That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
(Maybe I'ma get a little anxious, maybe I'ma get a little scared)
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
('Cause everybody's tryna be famous)


I'ma tell 'em all
(That's just the way I am)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
(That's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am
