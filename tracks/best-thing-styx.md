Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever had
Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever had

Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever had
Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever had

Silk and satin make me wonder
Just who I am
To be with you in times of slumber
Makin' me a man

I haven't known you for a very long time
But it's on my mind what I want to do
A trip to the skies we begin to fly
Oo-oh

All the riches I have taken
From you every night
Pay you back someday with interest
'cause your loving makes it right
Yeah

Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever had
Your loving seemed to be the best thing
That I ever, ever had
Oh yeah

Best thing
(repeat to fade)
