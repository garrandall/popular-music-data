And everything will be alright

Everything you ask of me sweet heart I'll do for you

My Promise to you is I'll always be true
No matter what No One, No One trys to do
To death do us part you can have my heart forever
And that's a Long, Long time

Just Be My Lady
Just take my hand and I'll lead the way
Just Be My Lady
