I met her in the morning she was lovely, lovely
Standing on the corner with my books in my hand
I said, "I'll see ya later"
She said, "Lovely, lovely"
I got to get this girl
I gotta get me a plan

(Lovely, lovely) So fine
(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely, you'll get there)
(Lovely, lovely) Uh huh
(Lovely, lovely) You're mine
(Lovely, lovely, walkin' on air)

I met her in the evening she was (lovely, lovely)
I took her out dancing and I held her real tight
I walked her in the garden it was (lovely, lovely)
I held her and I kissed her in the silver moonlight

(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely) Uh huh
(Lovely, lovely, you'll get there)
(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely) So fine
(Lovely, lovely, walkin' on air)

Saw her standing there
Her love is fine
Hey stop, don't go
Oh you're gonna be mine

You're just so lovely, lovely, so fine

(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely, you'll get there)
(Lovely, lovely) Uh huh
(Lovely, lovely) You're mine
(Lovely, lovely, walkin' on air)

I met her in the morning she was lovely, lovely
Laughin' and a talkin' and a lookin' so sweet
I put my arms around her it was lovely, lovely
Now were goin' steady and my plans are complete

(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely) You're fine
(Lovely, lovely, you'll get there)
(Lovely, lovely) Oh yeah
(Lovely, lovely) Uh huh
(Lovely, lovely, walkin' on air)
(Lovely, lovely)
