A time for memories returning
A time for heartache and yearning
Shades of blue, crowding through
As I sit here remembering you
A time for wondering what happened
For wondering why did it happen
No goodbye, not a sigh
How could love slip away and just dye
I thought that you, the night, the summertime
Were out of sight and out of mind
Yet here you are the night, the summertime
Still in my heart, I was blind
A time for memories returning
With too much heartache and yearning
So I better store these dreams away
Like broken toys in the attic the memories
Of my yesterdays
