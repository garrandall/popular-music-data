This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
Oh, I love you, yeah baby, I love you

Listen, baby
When I'm just barely survivin'
Oh, you make me feel so important
And you mean so much to me, that I never want to leave your side

Oh, this is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
Oh, and I love you, yeah baby, I love you

I know some of my friends try to tell you
That you oughta put me down
And start dating some other girls, yeah
Whenever I'm not around
And I feel so good till I hear someone say
You're not right for me
But when I'm with you, baby, I'm right where I want to be

This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
Oh, and I love you, yeah baby, I love you

My heart beats like a thousand drums
When I reach out to hold you in my arms
It feels like I'm floating on a cloud
Every time you speak my name out loud

This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel, when I'm with you, baby...
