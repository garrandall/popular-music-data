You're talking, it all sounds fair
You promise your love, how much you care
I'm still listening and still unsure
Your actions are lacking, nothing is clear


No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love

Remember when the words were new
They carried a meaning, a feeling so true
Well, I'm looking for a long romance
Not a picture of passion or one time chance



But don't fool yourself
Your empty passion won't satisfy me, I know
So don't pretend that you want me
You don't want me, no



We make love, and it's all the same
Your eyes show nothing, no lover's flame
Well, don't promise we can work it out
You can leave right now if you're feeling doubt



No more words
You're telling me you love me and looking away
No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises



No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises of love
No more words and no more promises of love
No more words and no more promises of love
