I never wanted
I never wanted to touch a man
The way that I want to touch you

I never wanted
I never wanted to love a man
The way that I want to love you

You are sunshine
You are shadow
You are morning
You are night
You are hard times
You are good times
You are darkness
You are light

I never wanted
I never wanted to give a man
The things that I want to give you

I never wanted
I never wanted to live with a man
The way that I want to live with you

You are sunshine
You are shadow
You are morning
You are night
You are hard times
You are good times
You are darkness
You are light

I never wanted
I never wanted to love a man
The way that I want to love you

I never wanted
I never wanted to touch a man
The way that I want to touch you
The way that I want to touch you now
The way that I want to touch you
The way that I want to touch you now
The way that I want to touch you
