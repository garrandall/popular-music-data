You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling


Sister girl, I know you don't understand
But you going have to understand he's my man now
What you had is gone, our thing is sweet
Our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me
He knows my heart and that's the part
Yo roots are dug up so you might as well give up
I see your intentions, you can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago now it's time to turn him loose


You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(You're getting in my way)
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(My feelings, you're...)
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(...getting in the way of what I'm feeling)


Sugar honey girl, fly, fly away
I been a lady up to now, don't know how much more I can take
Queens shouldn't swing if you know what I mean
But I'm bout to take my earrings off get me some Vaseline


(You better go on get out my face girl you better chill)
Chill and I mean it
(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
You better relax yourself
(You better go on get out my face girl you better chill)
He's my man and nobody else's
(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
You better back down


You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling)
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(You better back down)
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling
(You're getting in the way)
You're getting in the way of what I'm feeling


Everything was beautiful between me and him
And here come you and your big mouth talking about me
Telling him that you seen me up 24th Street
With them other cats, but you know that's a lie
You keep lying to my man girlfriend
I'm go take you out in the middle of the street and whoop your tail
For all this worth, 5.99 or something like that


(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
I ain't playin' wit' ya
(You better back down before you get smacked down you better chill)
