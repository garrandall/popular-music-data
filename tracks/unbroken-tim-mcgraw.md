How I ever lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall 
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces 
Of a jagged heart 
You kissed me and every piece went back in place, every pain got erased 
You held me up to the light 

No one ever left me out in the rain 
Cold words still remain unspoken 
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark 
You're here, now my heart's unbroken 
When I see your smile fill my soul again 
I'm unbroken 

If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand 
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch 
Of your magic hands 
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel 
Babe, the changes day and night 
I swear it's life 

No one ever left me out in the rain 
Cold words still remain unspoken 
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark 
You're here, now my heart's unbroken 
When I see your smile fill my soul again 
I'm unbroken 

I still see the night, I fell into your eyes 
And when we made love it felt like the first time 

No one ever left me out in the rain 
Cold words still remain unspoken 
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark 
You're here, now my heart's unbroken 
When I see your smile fill my soul again 
I'm unbroken 

When I see your smile fill my soul again 
I'm unbroken 
I'm unbroken, oh yeah 
I'm unbroken 

No one ever left me out in the rain 
Cold words still remain unspoken 
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark 
You're here, now my heart's unbroken 
When I see your smile fill my soul again 
I'm unbroken
