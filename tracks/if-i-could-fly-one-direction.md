If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything
Just ask me to


Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless


For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only


I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing


Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless


For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only


I can feel your heart inside of mine
(I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind
(I feel it, I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time, and I
Hope that you don't run from me


For your eyes only
I show you my heart
(For when you're lonely)
And forget who you are
(I'm missing half of me)
(When we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only)


For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only


For your eyes only
(For your eyes only)
