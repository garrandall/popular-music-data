I talked to my sister in Memphis
And I told her you were moving to town
Here's her number
She said she'd be glad to show you around
I left a map on your front seat
Just in case you lose your way
But don't worry, once you reach Sallisaw
It's all interstate

I know you need to go
But before you do I want you to know, that I


Wish you the best
And I wish you nothing less
Than every thing you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay


I figure right about sundown
You'll be in West Tennessee
And by then
Maybe I'll understand why you had to leave

I know that you've done some changing
And I know there's no changing your mind
And yes I know
We've been through this a thousand times

I'm sorry for still holding on
I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong, and I'll




Yeah, everything you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you'll find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay
I wish you'd stay
