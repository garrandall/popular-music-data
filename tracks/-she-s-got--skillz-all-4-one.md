Little rump shaker she can really shake and bake
She's got skillz
Watch her slippin and a slidin' working booty left to right

She's got skillz
She can work it to the left
Work it to the right
She wants to get a little freaky tonight

She's got the potion in the motion
To cure my illz
She's got skillz

She shimmies up my jimmy and she'll do me all night long
She's got skillz
In the mornin' when I'm yawnin' she gives me a sticky bun
She's got skillz

Yum yum eat 'em up think I'm in luck because
She wants to lick me like a lollipop
She's got the potion in the motion
To cure my illz
She's got skillz

Skillz
Girl has it goin' on
She's got skillz
Work her booty all night long
She's got skillz
Makes me wanna scooby doo
She's got skillz
Makes me want to zoom zoom zoom

She's got the potion in the motion
To cure my illz
She's got skillz

Yum yum eat 'em up think I'm in luck because
She wants to lick me like a lollipop

She's got the potion in the motion
To cure my illz
She's got skillz

Little rump shaker got the flavor that I like
She's got skillz
Little cutie with that booty, think I'll take her home
Tonight
She's got skillz
