AXL
Hahaha, huh? Hahaha
Tired of niggas cappin' (Tired of niggas cappin')
Trap House vibes
Niggas frontin' their jewels (Yeah)
They ain't expectin' this one (And it's like that)

Facts, my bitch love coco (Haha)
Ooh back, baby (Ooh back, baby), woo (Haha, yeah)
Let me see some, okay, okay (I see ya), okay, okay

Look, you cannot say Pop and forget the Smoke (Yeah)
I'm from the floors where niggas tote
They couldn't be Crips, so they turned folks (Bah)
Drivin' through the 'Ville, droppin' the choke (Brr)
I gotta laugh, 'cause these niggas jokes (Haha)
Just like, "Who these niggas?" (Who these niggas?)
"I don't know" (I don't know), but I'm on go (Woo)
And I'm in that Bugatti, movin' two hundred (Bah)
Givin' pumps, like, "Who shot ya?"
Me and Trey, that's four choppers (Woo)
Man down (Woo), all you see is helicopters (Grr)
Paramedics pick him up, they gon' send him to the doctor
I'm in the hood like an engine, revvin' (Trey, get that nigga)
My checks is clearin' (Woo, woo), your checks is pending (Woo, woo)
And I got a couple gangstas, let me know (It's a fact)
If you want smoke (If you want smoke)
'Cause boy I can send 'em (Boy I can send 'em)
And I got a bad bitch, ass up (Hahaha)
Face down (Face down), yeah, she love doggy style (Uh-huh)
And she got a Louis bag (Yeah), that hold the extendo (Woo, woo)
Okay, okay (Okay, okay)
Okay, okay


Facts, my bitch love coco (Haha)
Ooh back, baby (Ooh back, baby), woo
Let me see some, okay, okay (I see it), okay, okay (Turn around)
My bitch love coco
Ooh back, baby (Ooh back, baby), woo
Let me see some, okay, okay (I see it), okay, okay {Right}


Got it jumpin out the zoo, seein' red, seein' blue (Yeah)
Young La Flame, how it moves, Pop Flare how itâ (Woo)
Bring my hands out, try to hide my face (Yeah)
Duck away, she wanna lay up and hibernate
I took a chance, it's a lot to take
I took a right, ended up right away (Straight up)
She need a chunk, not a piece (Alright)
It cost me three for the keys (Keys)
Not the work but the V
She let it twirl to the beat
I send the work, bet it reach (Reach)
Wearin' pearls, expensive beads (Beads)
I only hurl at my peeps (It's lit)

Cuts, diamond cuts, I done popped a blue
Two cups of the stuff, now I'm up
Coco Chanel when she tuck it
We bunk, get a nut (Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)


My bitch love coco (Haha)
Ooh back, baby (Ooh back, baby), woo
Let me see some, okay, okay (I see it), okay, okay (Turn around)
My bitch love coco
Ooh back, baby (Ooh back, baby), woo
Let me see some, okay, okay (I see it), okay, okay (Turn around)
