Got it jumpin out the zoo, seein' red, seein' blue (Yeah)
Young La Flame, how it moves, Pop Flare how it— (Woo)
Bring my hands out, try to hide my face
Duck away, she wanna lay up and hibernate (Yeah)
I took a chance, it's a lot to take
I took a right, ended up right away (Straight up)
She need a chunk, not a piece (Alright)
It cost me three for the keys (Keys)
Not the work but the V
She let it twirl to the beat
I send the work, bet it reach (Reach)
Wearin' pearls, expensive beads (Beads)
I only hurl at my peeps (It's lit)


Cuts, diamond cuts, I done popped a blue
Two cups of the stuff, now I'm up
Coco Chanel when she tuck it
