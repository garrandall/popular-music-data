It's too late baby, there's no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud
This is how I do, when I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time


'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine


I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie


You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?


And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded


And you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming


I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?
(I feel like a hero and you are my heroine)


And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
(Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?)
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded


(I feel like a hero and you are my heroine)
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
(Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?)
