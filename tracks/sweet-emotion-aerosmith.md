Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're callin' my name, but I gotta make it clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go must've got up and went
Well, I got good news: she's a real good liar
'Cause a backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're tellin' other things, but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did

Standin' in the front just a-shakin' your ass
I take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your hand
