When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(Ooh)

I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye
(Ooh)

And I would have walked head on
Into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
