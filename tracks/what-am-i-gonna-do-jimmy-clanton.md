What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
I'm so lonely for you
What am I gonna do
When the sun goes down
And all the lights are low
What am I gonna do
When I recall the love
We used to know
I remember the happiness we knew
Darling, can't we make up soon
Cause I don't know
What I'm gonna do
What am I gonna do
On Wednesday night when I
Used to call you on the phone
What am I gonna say at the
Record hop when I show up alone
They'll all ask me
What's become of you
Darling, can't we make up soon
Cause I don't know
What I'm gonna do
At the movies
Or at the football game
Please believe me
Nothing's gonna be the same
Now what am I gonna do
On a Saturday night
When everything goes wrong
What am I gonna feel when
The radio plays our favorite song
I'm so lonely just like Mr. Blue
Darling, can't we make up soon
Cause I don't know
What I'm gonna do
Cause I don't know
What I'm gonna do
Cause I don't know
What I'm gonna do...
