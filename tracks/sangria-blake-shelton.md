You're crashing into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Trying to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

We're buzzing like that "no vacancy" sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

A wrecking ball dancing down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

We're buzzing like that "no vacancy" sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

Only thing I wanna do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

We're buzzing like that "no vacancy" sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

Oh

Only thing I wanna do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
