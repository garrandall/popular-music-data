Don't talk, just listen
First of all
I have to be honest with you, baby
I lied
When I told you I never wanted to see you again
Can you (Please stay, babe, hey, ay)
Just for tonight?
And maybe we can do something like
Make love, watch the sunrise
Or listen to JoJo, K-Ci sing us a verse
Slide, close, baby
Ha, let DeVante feel you
Oh, you feel so sexy and so good


I'm sorry I left you, I left you crying
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
'Cause all of my tears, you know they left me drowning
Please, baby I'm begging for you to stay at home


Tonight, let's start our love again (Start love again)
Tonight, we could be more than just friends
(Don't you know) The sun (You know what?) it is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
(Baby won't...)


Baby, won't you just stay?
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?

(Oh, babe...) Baby, won't you just stay?


So here we are
Just me and you
Thinking of the things that we used to do, babe, haha
Tonight is yours, lady
Yours and mine
Let's try again to put our trust on the line


Tonight, let's start our love again (Start our love again)
Tonight, we can be more than just friends
(You know the sun) The sun is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
(Forget about yesterday, stay...)


Baby, won't you just stay? (Oh...oh)
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while (I'm sorry I left you, baby)
Baby, won't you just stay? (Yes, I am; yes, I am)
For a little while (I'm sorry I left you crying, baby)
Baby, won't you just stay? (Yes, I am; yes, I am)
For a little while (I want my baby...)


Forget about yesterday
'Cause I want you so bad
Make love to me
Like you never have
My love is coming down
Baby, won't you just stay for a little while


Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
I'm sorry I've done you so wrong, so wrong
And I really need you to come back home
I'm on my bended knee
I'm begging you please
No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no, (Stay) no-no-no-no-no-no-no
Come on back, come on back
Come on back, yeah...
