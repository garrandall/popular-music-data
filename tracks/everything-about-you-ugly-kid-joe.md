I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I hate beach and mountains too
(And) I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

And I, hate everything about you!
...Everything about you!

And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
'Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

And I get sick when I'm around, I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you!
Everything about you, everything about you, everything about you!

Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again 'cause I ain't wearing no frown!

Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe

I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad
'Cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you! ha-ha!

Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around

I hate everything about... 

YOU!
