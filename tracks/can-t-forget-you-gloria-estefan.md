There's a part of me that's dying every time I hear your name
There's a part of me that's trying to bring back your love again
There are times when I just want to run, but there's no place to hide
Even though my heart is breaking in a million bits inside
I can make believe that none of this is true


But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow, we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

There are nights when I lay wide awake thinking of how good it could be
Other nights I don't feel worthy of the love you gave to me
I remember not too long ago we both were here to stay
But it seems it happened overnight when I threw it all away
I can walk away and find somebody new


But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow, we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

Hope that I can make you love me once again


But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow, we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday
