Oh, how it hurts
(Oh, how it hurts)
To say goodbye, yes, it does
Oh, how it hurts
(Oh, how it hurts)
For me to cry but that's all right

Because I'd rather leave you now
'Cause it's gonna hurt more after while
Yes, it will
(Yes, it will)
After while
(After while)

I know you've found somebody new
Yes, you have
You think you found your dream come true
That's alright

Because I'd rather leave you now
'Cause it's gonna hurt more after while
Yes, it will
(Yes, it will)
After while
(After while)

I can't take it
We can't make it
No need to feel ashamed

Why try to hide it
You can't deny it
That a new love
Has set your heart aflame

Oh, how it hurts
(Oh, how it hurts)
For me to be blue, yes, it does
Oh, how it hurts
(Oh, how it hurts)
To be without you, yes, it does

But I'd rather end it now
'Cause it's gonna hurt more after while
Yes, it will
(Yes, it will)
After while
(After while)

And I'd rather end it now
Before it's too late after while
