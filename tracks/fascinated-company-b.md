I want to play with you tonight
Hold me
That's all that's on my mind
Baby, something feels so right
Maybe we could play tonight


I want to be so in love with you
I want to do just what you want to do
I want to be all that to you
I got a dream
And you can make it true


Cause I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel


Love me until the morning light
Please me, make me feel alright
Kiss me, let me make you mine
I love it, loving you sometime


Come on, come on
I want to be with you
Come on, come on
I won't get over you
I want to do just what you want me to
I got a dream
And you can make it good


Cause I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel


I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Cause I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
And I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated
