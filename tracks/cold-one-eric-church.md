It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I was starin' at that green water when out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, "I'm out of here," and walked out of my life

That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
Damn, babe, that was a cold one

It ain't the first time, or last time I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
Cause every time I see one sweating, man, I break out in one too

That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
Damn, babe, that was a cold one

That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
Damn, babe, that was a cold one

Damn, babe, that was a cold one
