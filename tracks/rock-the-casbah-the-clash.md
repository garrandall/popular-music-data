Now the king told the boogie men 
You have to let that raga drop 
The oil down the desert way 
Has been shakin' to the top 
The sheik he drove his Cadillac 
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville 
The muezzin was a' standing 
On the radiator grille 


The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 
The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 

By order of the prophet 
We ban that boogie sound 
Degenerate the faithful 
With that crazy Casbah sound 
But the Bedouin they brought out 
The electric camel drum 
The local guitar picker 
Got his guitar picking thumb 
As soon as the shareef 
Had cleared the square 
They began to wail 



Now over at the temple 
Oh! They really pack 'em in 
The in crowd say it's cool 
To dig this chanting thing 
But as the wind changed direction 
The temple band took five 
The crowd caught a wiff 
Of that crazy Casbah jive 



The king called up his jet fighters 
He said you better earn your pay 
Drop your bombs between the minarets 
Down the Casbah way 

As soon as the shareef was 
Chauffeured outta there 
The jet pilots tuned to 
The cockpit radio blare 

As soon as the shareef was 
Outta their hair 
The jet pilots wailed 



He thinks it's not kosher 
Fundamentally he can't take it. 
You know he really hates it.
