I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still, here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searchin' even after today

So there it is, girl
I've said it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay

I know it's late I know you're weary
Oh I know your plans don't include me
Still, here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light (Turn out the light)
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay

Oh we've got tonight (We've got tonight)
Who needs tomorrow
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light (turn out the light)
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay

Oh oh why don't you stay
