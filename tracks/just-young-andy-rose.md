Not my momma, not my daddy, not my uncle but it's me oh Lord
Looking at me like I'm crazy and I'm crazy and it's me oh Lord
Like I'm stuck up in the Matrix and I'm feeling like I'm Neo, Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Standing in the need of prayer
Ha

Look when I was young, I was dumb, then I got older
I'm still dumb the only difference is that now I know it
When I'm a grumpy old man, I'ma love it
I say all the other things I used to say without the repercussions
Some people push my buttons
Say wild things in public
They like LeBron jumpin', I'm just supposed to rise above it
I need strength to not act crazy, now please, Lord
It seem like everybody is a thug behind that keyboard
Until I find they IP addresses then hire the private investigator to find the place that they rest in
Show up to they front door, calm and collected
Just to test them to see if they bold as they was actin' in my comment section
Drivin' down the one way in the wrong direction
All because I'm occupied with the Spotify and the song selection
Wifey sayin', "Chill," she tryna take my phone
Jesus take the wheel
Tryna make it home

Not my momma, not my daddy, not my uncle but it's me oh Lord
I don't wanna look crazy
Looking at me like I'm crazy and I'm crazy and it's me oh Lord
I don't wanna look crazy
Like I'm stuck up in the Matrix and I'm feeling like I'm me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Standing in the need of prayer
Ha
