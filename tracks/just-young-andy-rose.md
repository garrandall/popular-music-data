Just young
Just young
When they see us walking home together
And we're holding hands just along the way
They'll say it's just because we're young
Just young

When they see your picture on my bureau
And they see me kiss it everyday
They'll say it's just because we're young
Just young

Just young but it isn't the way we feel
Our hearts tell us our love is real

Til the time we make them understand us
Secretly we'll smile about the way they say
It's just because we're young
Just young

They say it's just because we're young
Just young

Just young but it isn't the way we feel
Our hearts tell us our love is real

Til the time we make them understand us
Secretly we'll smile about the way they say
It's just because we're young
Just young

Just young
Just young
