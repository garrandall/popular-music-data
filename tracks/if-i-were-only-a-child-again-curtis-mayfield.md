If I were only a child again
No one's ever been, oh, good to me since then
Everywhere I looked it seemed so color bright
There were never such things to me as black and white

Remember when we were part of that special few
Everything it seemed was so pure and true
I guess we were just too young to understand
The unselfish cause of death and war and roles of man

Only, only, only a child
Only, only, only a child
Only, only, only a child
Only a child again, hey, hey

If I were only a child again
I would never want to venture life like this again
People of the world hurling sticks and stones
Like the sore fates of one come up and break my bones

Only, only, only a child

If I were only a child again
And have the ability to understand
I'd speak for little people from the date of birth
And ask the grown ups, when will there be peace on earth?

Grown ups, when will there be peace on earth?
Brother, when will there be peace on earth?

Only, only, only a child
Only, only, only a child
Only, only, only a child
Only a child again, hey, hey
