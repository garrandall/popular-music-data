Watch me now, here I go, all I need's a little snow
Starts me off, sets the theme, helps me dream my Christmas dream
Every year I dream it, hoping things will change
An end to the crying, the shouting, the dying

And I hope you will dream it too
It's Christmas, remember? We've got to remember
So, light the light, I'm home tonight
I need you to warm me, to calm me, to love me
To help me to dream my Christmas dream

Crazy things, said and done every single day but one
Every night should, I believe be the same as Christmas eve
Nights should all be silent, days should all slow down
An end to the hurry, the noise and the worry

And I hope you believe that too
It's Christmas, remember? Does no one remember?
The whole world needs, a Christmas dream
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us
To help us to dream our Christmas dream



The whole world needs, a Christmas dream
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us
To help us to dream our Christmas dream
