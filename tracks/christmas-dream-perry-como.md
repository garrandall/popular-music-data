I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
just like the ones I used to know  
where the tree tops glisten  
and children listen  
to hear sleigh bells in the snow! 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
with every Christmas card I write.  
May your days be merry an' bright  
and may all your Christmas's be white!  

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
just like the ones I used to know  
where the tree tops glisten  

and children listen (and children listen!) 
to hear sleigh bells in the snow! 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
with every Christmas card I write.  
May your days be merry an' bright  
and may all your Christmas's be white!  

(...may all your Christmas's be white!)
