Tried to amend my carnivorous habits
Made it nearly seventy days
Losin' weight without speed
Eatin' sunflower seeds
Drinkin' lots of carrot juice and soakin' up rays

But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams
Some kind of sensuous treat
Not zucchini, fettuccini, or bulgur wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat

Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular, not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

Heard about the old-time sailor men
They eat the same thing again and again
"Warm beer and bread," they say, "could raise the dead"
Well, it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn

But times have changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just Havanas or bananas, or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed

Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium rare with mustard'd be nice
Heaven on Earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and French fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god almighty, which way do I steer...

...for my cheeseburger in paradise?
Makin' the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise
To be a cheeseburger in paradise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and French fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god almighty, which way do I steer?
