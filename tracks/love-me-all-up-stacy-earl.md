I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby

Oh, yeah

Sweet, sweet temptation
For my soul sensation
I just got to have you all to myself
Give it up
A fact's a fact
Too late now for turning back
Every calculation comes up with you

I gotta feel the fire, baby
I guess I'll never learn

I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up

I'm wild for you, baby
(I'm wild for you)
You got me going crazy
I need something different
A new kind of thrill

Reflections of your heart and soul
(Reflections, heart and soul)
In my kiss
I'll make you whole

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll satisfy you

I got a one track mind, baby
And you just crossed my line

I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up

I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up

You're the stars in the night
You're the dream I can touch
Baby, don't be afraid
You can love me tonight

I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up

I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up

I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby

I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby
