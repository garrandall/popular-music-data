Girl, I'm a super Negro
You dudes are zero
Baby, let me be your super hero
I spit that dope, that blow, that preemo, that coke, that smack, that al pacino 


Fly like nino, tough like deebo
We back like teevo, and fat like cee-lo
I drink cognac, I drink veeno
Should I drink all that
You should drink though
Grab a red cup, fill that shit up
And drink till u can no longer hold your head up
I'm a act a fool I don't know no better
But I never get a stain on this polo sweather
So incredible, unforgettable
She be on my nuts like they all so edible
She be on my nuts like it's some kind of candle tho
She be on my nuts like shes lookin for antidote
She be on my nuts cus she don't want her man to know
That she was on my nuts so tough that her camera broke
Feelin like a young earl manacho
What u smoking on now
Oh that's medical
Oh what they smoking on that, all that araginal
Bullshit, weed that's some shit we don't ever smoke
Mike, tell the dj to play my records tho
Ladies on the dancefloor
Go go, gadget go!


Stacy and Brittany, go Erica and Whitney like Tiffany, go Sasha and Tasha all proper 



She like vodka, we like cognac
Poured her a cup and she had thrown that
We like vodka, she like old rap
Used it for the same, but we don't own that
I can't lie, meet the bow neck
That your ass girl I need to hold that
Take my time then I'm a own that
Have u seen them like a keyshia cold shrack
I want safe sex, u want paychecks
I just say next, I ain't for that
This that train wreck u can't roll that
Cali young lee u can't grow that
See u staring baby take a quote that
Get my good side, where my pose at
Wash you down where my hoes at
Early morning like where my clothes at
Why u hurryingly, take a slow job
Why you worryingly take some projack
Checked just clear where my olds at
Call my homies where my bros at
We gon dip out, we gon flip out
Dog, u rollin don't bring your chick out
Girl u rollin don't bring your dude out
Fat frend comin don't bring no food out


Stacy and Brittany, go Erica and Whitney like Tiffany, go Sasha and Tasha all proper 


Put my lights on you niggas
Dump a couple ashes
Jumped to a benz
Skipped a couple classes
Rap shit is cool but I've been tochin asses
Now we have to food had enough for the fastin
Fuck them caskets, clutch their cash yeah
Baby be young only fucks with magnums
Oh it's showtime like I fucks with magic
Birthday suit, yeah I love that fabric
Something tragic, man what's something my niggas know
Had a bad red bone with the pitten toes
On a Tuesday mike fucked the bigger role
Got me stuck like mogli in the middle tho
All my niggas going and boys in the mirror baby
Tryin to fact the sort of playing shit they're hearing baby
Blocking everytime I pass in the firenze lady
You know we do it little crazy
