Na, Na, Na, Naâ¦ Hey, Hey, Heyâ¦ Good Bye!


Whooo! Câmon, Bone Thug, We gonâ do it like this, yeahâ¦ Kray Jacksonâ¦

Remember the killa, the lyrical beast? Iâm gonâ murda ya!
Up in you like a hernia.
You suck, Iâm just confirminâ ya, nigga!
If you did it, nigga, then clearly we talkinâ about you!
Get off the bandwagon
Nigga, quit swinginâ on dicks and get your brand accurate.
Kray Jack the man, ask âem!
Donât need a hand.
Rappinâ insane with the same average, always above!
Nigga, never no love,
You niggas is artificial, insufficient, not an issue.
Our position is monumental, all your shit was accidental!
Simple, donât be no fool!
Donât be consumed in auto-tune. (Auto-tune!)
âCause itâs a deadly storm blowinâ through here soon.
Originators can survive it if they stay true and innovate.
Imitators, fakers, they all die


Yâall simply canât all rap and it ainât no time to play.
Twenty-four hours a day, thatâs seven straight!
My killers be rallied up, the scrilla â they tally up.
Like Ballyâs â I exercise you.
Like Dahmer â I victimize you.
Criticize you for using auto-tune.
Recognize here comes your doom.
Thereâs no room for the wack. They be givinâ a black eye to the game.
But thereâs more than a thousand ways to get âem and leave the lames strangled.
Flesh banged on âem and I never did let up.
Fandango you hoes!
Opponents they keep their back on the ropes, their faces hit the floor.
Suckers ainât nothinâ but jokes with their vocals made artificially.
Iâd rather buck âem yâall exposed, now they gotta get disposed.
My temp is still burning hot, while these phonyâs, they hardly not!
We can lock on up and then see how hard of a hit you got!


Na, Na, Na, Naâ¦ Hey, Hey, Heyâ¦ Good Bye!â¦ Bye Bye!â¦ Bye Bye!
Why they want to sound like, dress like, act like? (Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone)
Why they want to look like, dress like, sound like?
(Itâs the Thuggish Ruggish!) Itâs the critical, criminal, non-subliminal.
Set it off, let it off, lines is visible.
I battle, I challenge, I rhyme my syllables.
Sound like Bone, thatâs dispicable.
Iâll put you in I.C.U. I see you is not original.
Itâs pitiful, niggas ainât lyrical.
Give me that deal, give me that miracle!
They lackinâ the talent, they lackinâ the balance, they lackinâ the harmony.
These niggas pretenders, no contenders, it ainât hard to see.
No authenticity, they wonât make history.
They only makinâ Lil Lay-Lay mad, they going out like they J.J. Fad.
Now how do these stars assume they can use the auto-tune,
Just because the bass go boom I spend my dollars, consume?
But naw, I bring these lames to their doom.
Better wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
We bringinâ back innovation.
We havinâ a celebration, cause Flesh-n-Bone is home.
Been ten years strong, thatâs domination.
Never need no nomination âcause homie the streets respect it.
We keepinâ it epic and never neglect it we get it in on a record.
Iâm talkinâ about keepinâ it classic, they talkinâ about keepinâ it plastic.
They puttinâ the game in a casket. We gonna live on like the Jacksons.
Iâm sorry Iâm endinâ your cycle, I gotta do this for Michael.
You heard from Jay-Z, but nigga this Layzie, itâs somethinâ Iâm willinâ to die for

Yeahâ¦ Come on! Come On! Come On!
Na, Na, Na, Naâ¦ Hey, Hey, Heyâ¦ Good Bye!


Come here nigga, you know what?â¦

First off let me take it back to High School.
You niggas teach rules, being in a rented crib.
To this day I donât wear Jordanâs.
Wasnât the first nigga with them in High School
(?) ass nigga, put that out (Put that out!)
Shine in everybodyâs category.
Cut that out, (Cut that out!) Flat out! (Flat out!)
Itâs a damn shame, for spare change, what come out these fraudelent rappersâ mouth.
Or should I say entertainers, Iâm complaininâ.
North, East, West, and South, cut that out.
âTil âem all Pac and no slouch. (Get it! Get it! Get it!)
If you canât sing, then donât sing!
The realest knew they place and they did it.
We blaze auto-tune so you need to sense this (Bone! Bone! Bone!).
Rest and silent hood living. (lifted?)
They feel me resonate it. Get Bible realest.
Quiet me, (Naw!) Iâmma stay hood, harmonied out.


Invisible cut the Crucifix, explodes into the galaxy!
Show you niggas how loose I get â No! No fatalities!
Zeus, Iâm cominâ to juice the mix. Operation: Totality
Opium flow wherever I go, auto-tune to the Matrixes.
Shot myself in Cali, woke up without no witnesses.
Satan, think she my mistresses.
Mohammad, where my bitches is?
Eveâs wicked as witches is
Yeah! Nigga this peanuts!
Iâm T-Pain, back with my Nazarinians and we nuts!
These Palestinians with 3 buck shots!
When Roger Troutman caught his brother back from Hades like Cain â took him out!
Generals say âGet out man.â
Give me my third eye and Iâll pitch it back to the masters.
Like the back of the dollar, but why?
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!


Na, Na, Na, Naâ¦ Hey, Hey, Heyâ¦ Good Bye!
