Say you love
Say I'm the one your eyes see
Tell me you need me
Deep down inside like I need you
You see I need you to see me through
I wanna hear you say darling, I love you
Through the rain and through the cold
Together we will never grow old
Sometime a goin' will get a little tough
I must admit livin' with me can get rough
I need you to see me through
I get off when you say, baby, baby, baby I love you


So say
Say
You love me
Say
Say
You love me


Let me be, let me be your man
Together I believe we could stand
Let me take your tremblin' hand
Somewhere in God's country, we'll settle on a piece of land
I need you to see me through
I just shake when you say, I love you
Keep on sayin'
