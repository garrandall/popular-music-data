Buss...it...baby...
Hey can I please talk to my bust it babies real quick homie
Let me bring you to my world, and (Plies) let (Ne-Yo) you know where I call lil bust it baby


She got me speedin in the fast lane
Peddle to flo maine, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around they know us
They know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my...


If I wasn't married to the streets it'd be you
Yo lips, what make you so cute
Love when you poke your mouth out when ya mad too
Save yo number in my phone under lil boo
Like yo sex, but more in love wit what you do
Turns me on how u stare at me when we through
When u give it too me I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan round you so all I can say is ooo
My favorite panties of yours are the ones that see through
The one with the pink trim on em and they light blue
Speakin fo' the goons, thank God fo' makin you
Buss it baby, that's what I call you


She got me speedin in the fast lane
Peddle to flo maine, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around they know us
They know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my...


Yeah, yeah, yeah,...so now
They say he's an entertainer, slow down
You're just one more, he don't respect you
He just gon hurt you, and neglect you?
Well let em say what they wanna, (yeah)
I made a promise, (yeah) to do you right and I'm gonna (yeah)
Girl I'll do everything I can
To prove I'm better man then yo friends think I am


She got me speedin in the fast lane
Peddle to flo maine, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around they know us
They know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my...


I just gave her a nickname, it's wet wet
Cuz when we finish she mess up all my bed sets
She got somethin to relax me when I'm under stress
Neva told her or let her know it but shes the best
She like to spell her name wit her tounge on my chest
If you woulda told me it was this good I woulda never guessed
She full of suprises, ionno what shell do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in the heels with the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own check
My buss it baby, I keep her on deck


She got me speedin in the fast lane
Peddle to flo maine, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around they know us
They know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my (buss it) baby
Everybody know that's my...
