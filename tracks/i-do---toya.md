He was a six foot stallion
Said a storybook thug
He was the kind
That made you wonder how he put down the love

He had a hickey in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop pulpitating
Every time he came near

He has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin
He was plaided
And his head was cornrows

He has his wrists bling-blinging
And his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go


I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you

So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out playa
Balling out of control


Me and my crew started grooving
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show

I shook my hips
Took a dip
Roll my tongue 'cross my lips

And when he took his place to dance wit me
I felt fingertips on the small of my back
So I had to react like I was playing hard to get
And told that boy to step back

But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you
Fa 'sho




Watch me
Drop, drop
Shake it
For the fellas who know

Watch me pop
Pop my hips
As I dip and roll

Watch me stop
Stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowing all the papi's want me
But all I want is you
