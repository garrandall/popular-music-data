This song is going out to
The whole wide world out there
And it's called Louie, Louie

I was talking with my mom
About music one day
She told me about this song
Called Louie, Louie

That when she was my age
Caused a big ass rumble
They thought it was filthy
Cause the words were mumbled

Like the singer was trying
To cover up the lyrics
They pulled it off of the air
Caused the people with hysterics

Louie, Louie, oh, no
Down and down, oh, no
I said Louie Louie, oh, yeah
Down and down, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now that my mama's story
Was all we talked about
It was about getting busy
And nobody had no doubt

It was unprecedented
What they said on that platter
That nobody knew the words
So it really didn't really
Seem to matter

I told her, hey, mom
I'd like to check out that song
She turned on a oldies station
It came on before long

Louie, Louie, oh, yeah
Down and down, yeah, yeah, yeah
Louie Louie (say what) oh, yeah
Down and down, oh, yeah

Hey, hey, hey...
Come on, c-c-come on

My mother was right
The words were in an awful state
But I knew there was one dude
Who made a good track great

So I got the great Buffy
And asked him can you hear
What they're saying on the record
He said, yo, yo, it's clear

Can you hear it, Kool Rock
They are the deffest crew
They are rapping just the way
I always wanted to

So he started rapping
And he did know every word
I was all flabbergasted
For this is what I heard

Louie, Louie (say what) oh, no
Down and a round, yeah, yeah, yeah
Louie Louie (say what) oh, no
Down and a round, oh, no

Louie, Louie, oh, yeah
I said Louie, Louie, oh, no
(Come on, come on)
Down and a round, oh, no

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie...
