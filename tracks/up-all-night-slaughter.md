And when morning comes...

Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day

When evening comes I am alive
I love to prowl around in the streets
It's the moonlight that controls my mind
Now I've got the power to speak, yeah

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Watching the city lights
(Stars are shining down)
They'll be shining down on you and I
(And when the morning comes)
And I'll hold you till the morning light

Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right

Driving down the boulevard all alone
The neon signs are calling your name
Find me in the corner having the time of my life
You'd think you'd wanna do the same

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Watching the city lights
(Stars are shining down)
They'll be shining down on you and I
(And when the morning comes)
And I'll hold you till the morning light

Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, come on
Up all night
Ah, maybe we can just stay up
Twenty four hours a day



(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Watching the city lights
(Stars are shining down)
They'll be shining down on you and I
(And when the morning comes)
And I'll hold you till the morning light

Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, come on
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night

(Land where my fathers died)
(Land of the pilgrims' pride)
(From every mountainside)
(Let freedom ring)
