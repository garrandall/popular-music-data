Okay, Coconut man, Moon Head and Pea
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second.
Just stop for a minute and smile

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious?
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time


Everybody look to their left (yeah)
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight?


It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) ch-ch-ching ch-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) bl-bling-bl-bling
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag (OK)


We need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite!
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes,
Am I the only one getting tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright


Everybody look to their left (to their left)
Everybody look to their right (to their right)
Can you feel that (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight?


It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) ch-ch-ching ch-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) bl-bling-bl-bling
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag


Yeah, yeah
Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can, can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need
Are keys and guitars
And guess what? In 30 seconds
I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across
These undefeatable odds
It's like this, man
You can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love
So we fight and sacrifice
Every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall
Never
Waiting to see or send a sign of defeat
Uh uh
So we gonna keep everyone
Moving their feet
So bring back the beat
And then everyone sing
It's not about the money

Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Forget about the price tag, yeah
