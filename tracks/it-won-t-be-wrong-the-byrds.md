Every time I see you smile, come to me, don't be long
Let me tell you how my heart goes wild
Please let me love you and it won't be wrong

Every time you're in my arms, come to me , don't be long
You know that I'll never do you no harm
Please let me love you and it won't be wrong

Let me love you and then you'll see, come to me, come to me
Let me show you once and we'll be free
Please let me love you and it won't be wrong

Every time I see you smile, come to me, don't be long
Let me tell you how my heart goes wild
Please let me love you and it won't be wrong

Let me love you and then you'll see, come to me, come to me
Let me show you once and we'll be free
Please let me love you and it won't be wrong
