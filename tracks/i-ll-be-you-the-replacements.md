I thought we had,
Such a good thing going,
Now the light you burned,
Is dying out so slowly


For starters, ain't heartless I donât hate them,
But I was starving and parted our relations,
I never live in the past like the forsaken,
I was ill, you were never the master of your patience,
We were martyrs for this mayhem,
Now youâre passing your ass out to artists as replacements,
I know itâs harder to father than to make friends,
But you see Iâm proud regardless where my day ends,
It was a task to ask you just to pay rent,
And you laughed cause my heart was in the basement,
Never targeted the market just to make ends,
Wasnât all scars there were parts of it that made sense,
Walking away were the hardest conversations,
Hope you learned if youâre smart you shouldnât date friends,
And I still donât understand you,
So I gotta say fuck you, thank you


I thought we had,
Man I thought that we had,
Such a good thing going,
But we donât, but we donât, but we donât,
Now the light you burned,
Now the light that you burned,
Is dying out so slowly,
And we go, and we go, and we go


Must be hard trying to keep the facade,
Here we are, you nothing, me needing a laugh,
Went from driving to not even a seat in the car,
Still lying now to kissing every cheek of my ass,
From family tree, to just another leaf in the park,
Hope those bright ideas help you see in the dark,
Itâs like first, you say something, second, you blame others,
Third burn the bridge like the first Rage cover,
But they donât know and they never will what weâve been through,
Itâs not you, itâs me, nah itâs you,
I got a lot of love for things you did,
If it only added up to all the things you missed,
Guess thatâs it, heard that you were running with him,
Saw you settled down now and had a couple of kids,
Shit the world keeps spinning like a bottle top,
See the light you burned started something that I aint gonna stop


I thought we had,
Man I thought that we had,
Such a good thing going,
But we donât, but we donât, but we donât,
Now the light you burned,
Now the light that you burned,
Is dying out so slowly,
And we go, and we go, and we go


What a soulful old anthem,
You used to burn brighter now you couldnât hold a lighter to a lantern,
Went from fighter to a phantom,
Invited inside of my life but you a bantam,
Weight, with some heavyweight issues,
Had to separate with you, get you heavy grade tissues,
For all your mood swings, so not amusing,
You could blow the rock out a mood ring,
You can blow the rocks and the tubing,
You can go super hoe the block for a shoestring,
Budget for all I care and this is what I got,
For all my caring? So fuck it,
Nah I ain't sleeping on the couch, you can sleep on the carpet,
Iâm a take the bed and sleep like a starfish,
Hog all the blankets, and sleep off the lagers,
And wake up in the morning like we feeling marvelous


I thought we had,
Man I thought that we had,
Such a good thing going,
But we donât, but we donât, but we donât,
Now the light you burned,
Now the light that you burned,
Is dying out so slowly,
And we go, and we go, and we go,
I thought we had,
Man I thought that we had,
Such a good thing going,
But we donât, but we donât, but we donât,
Now the light you burned,
Now the light that you burned,
Is dying out so slowly,
And we go, and we go, and we go
