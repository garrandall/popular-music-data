You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe

Steady ready to wreck shop
Another rough kid from the streets
Don't sleep on the crew, 'cuz if we roll through
You'll get hit up, watch blood spit up
Hit ya wit' a blow to the back of your head you won't get up
Action, I'm takin' heads like a hunter
Step like you wanna get done I want ya
Bes' believe I move quick then step
Those who never had a chance must have slept
You lost track, swing low, caught a blow hard to impact
I rip when I gotta make dents, so I rock wit' ease
Yeah, you gotta believe

You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe

Cold hard, I get it started 'cuz I'm liable and I'm able
To keep it stable whippin' @!# with my mic cable
You catch fits from my smash hits
Then I bring 'em, don't even need bees when I sting' em
So check it, I bet you thought that I couldn't wreck it
But I'm fat and when it's time flow I handle that
Marky Mark and the Funk B's slide Gs with ease over lordin' M.C.s
What up you sucker, feel strong? Think ya got it goin' on?
Chump's moves are all wrong

It's not a hoax, no jokes, I smokes mic's, like a Phillie Blunt
Don't ever try to front
And it's quite absurd yo, word to herb
When your sleepin' on a Wahlberg
Step to this and I'm a break you down to the knees
So, you gotta believe

You gotta believe Better believe it
You gotta believe Yo better believe
You gotta believe Better believe it
You gotta believe You better believe

The double M got more kick comin' from my rhyme
And comin' from my 9, I rip it up on 2 or 3 times
Remember that still droppin' kids like bricks
While your hoe's on tour tryin' to pull tricks
Gotta know this, doubt and your out for the count
Runnin' ruff rhymes keeps me paid in large amounts
Most of y'all got a problem, keep out my biz
And everything'll be straight: 'There it is'
But if not get a conflict, please no problem
I can handle that real quick
I got too many tricks up my sleeve
And I'm fully aware and prepared
So, you gotta believe

You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
