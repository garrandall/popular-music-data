(Oh)
I cried my eyes out once before (sha la la la sha la la la la)
But I won't do it anymore (sha la la la sha la la la la)
'Cause baby I've got news for you (sha la la la sha la la la la)
And this is what I'm gonna do

I ain't gonna kiss you no more no more
Ain't gonna tell you I'm yours for sure
You're gonna wonder if
I even care at all
'Cause I told you once to come on come on
Love me before it's all gone all gone
Please don't you see that I'm
Just crazy about you

A million little tears I've she'd
Went through your heart and to your head
I would have bought the world for you
But now here's what I'm gonna do

I ain't gonna kiss you no more no more
Ain't gonna tell you I'm yours for sure
You're gonna wonder if
I even care at all
'Cause I told you once to come on come on
Love me before it's all gone all gone
Please don't you see that I'm
Just crazy about you

Ain't gonna kiss you no more no more
Ain't gonna tell you I'm yours for sure
You're gonna wonder if
I even care at all
