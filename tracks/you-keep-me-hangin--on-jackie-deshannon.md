Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out of my life, why don't you, babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You just keep me hangin' on

I know you don't know what I'm goin' through
Standing here lookin' at you
Well, let me tell you that it hurts so, hurts so bad
Makes me feel so sad
Hurts so bad to see you again
Like needles and pins

People say "You've been makin' out okay
He's in love, don't stand in his way"
Well, let me tell you that it
It hurts so, hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It hurts, hurts so bad when you walk away

Why don't you stay, let me make it up to you?
Stay, I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before, you'll love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go, please don't go
Hurts so bad
You know it makes me feel so sad
Hurt so bad when you walk away

Oh, set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out of my life, why don't you, babe?
I know you really don't love me
You just keep me hangin' on
I know you really don't need me
You just keep me hangin' on

Set me free, why don't you, baby?
Get out of my life, why don't you, baby?
