Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man,

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinking that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young


So we live a life like a video
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day
That lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young...

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever
Forever young


Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while we're alive,
Life is for living not living uptight,
'Til you're somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye byes are not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,
Showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here,
And as the father passed the story down to his son's ears,
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby,

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young


Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsches,
Popping up on Forbes lists,
Gorgeous,
Hold up,
Niggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous,
Hold up,
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit,
And I ain't waiting for closure,
I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young...

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young,
