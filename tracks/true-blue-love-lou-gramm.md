Had enough of my yesterdays
Can't go back to mistakes that I've made
Had enough of my dark side
And the hard ride we've been through

Now I know I've got so much to prove
But don't let go, I've been a heart-selfish fool
It's a feeling I'm rising above
And I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Running hard in an empty race
Just take a look at the lines on this face
In my eyes you can measure the miles
But no one can measure desire

So take my hand, can you feel how it burns
Don't let go till your heart finally learns
Why this wandering soul has returned
To give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

And I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away from true blue love

I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

Now I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Now I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away, away from true blue love

Into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

No more loneliness
Just some tenderness
Don't turn away true blue love

Only tenderness
No more loneliness
Oh, baby, I'll give you true blue love
Oh yeah, only tenderness
Don't turn away
Don't turn away true blue love
