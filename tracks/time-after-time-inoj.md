I'm lying in my bed
Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...

Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me (And you will find me)
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen
All from deep inside
The 808's on time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

Time after

And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The 808's on time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time (Time)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time (Time after)
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me (I know you will find me)
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)...
