You are so much cool one, I don't worry about a thing
You are pushin' full of lovin' that makes my heart sing
I know that you want me and you prove it every day
You're the kind of girl I can find giving my birds and I say


Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself


Baby, I'm so proud, I really wanna scream out loud
I can't hold it any longer, your love talk is getting stronger
Just one look in your eyes can make a young man cry
Said I couldn't advertise, but baby, you apologize


Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself


Look, your love is harder than the hardest rock
Ooh-wee, it's shocking like electric wire
Yeah, yeah


Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Everybody, listen to me
I wanna tell ya...
