Got my hands on a little bit of dough
So I went to the grocery store
And got some steaks to go
Went by and picked up my gal, Teddi Jo
We had ourselves a picnic
Beside a dirt road


Rooty toot toot
Rooty toot toot
We had it made in the shade
Like a ball through the hoop
Spinnin' and tumblin' inside this hoola hoop
Livin' and learnin'
Rooty toot toot

We laid out a blanket
And started a fire
Had the radio playin'
From inside the car
I took off my shirt and kicked off my shoes
She read the paper
And told me the news
She said, there's a lot of people out there
Who are at the end of their rope
Sometimes baby
You've got to lay low



We stayed there all day
We both got us some real good suntans
I thought that was ok
Sometimes life can be so grand

We were gettin' ready
To shake out of that place
When the Illinois state trooper
Got in my face
He said, You're on private property
But once he cooled down he was ok
Sometimes you're golden, man
That's all I got to say
