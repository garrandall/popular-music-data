You can't be pushin' up on it you betta werk if you want it 

Don't even call me
If you gotta bout 2/3 other boos
Cause if you want me
You gon' have to give more than usual
Won't be no playin'
Boy my time is just way too valuable

I don't like so don't try to be like the last guy way too comfortable

You wanna hold me
If you wanna stand right next to me
Gotta be the only
Only chick in this room this room you'll see
This room you'll see
So if you want me,
Gotta give gotta give me your everything
Cause I need the right guy to be on the right side givin' it all to me

If you really want me
I demand your responsibility
If you really want me
Takes a lot of moxy to bring me to my knees
I said I said if you really want me
Get ready get ready boy, you should elbow grease
If you really want me
Prove yourself you gotta make it real to me

You betta werk 
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do

If you want me
In my ear boy but make it clear to me
It's how you gonna give
A smile unless you keep it straight G with me
I'm on a cuteness
Way too old to be livin' in make believe

So don't be the wrong type cause I have a say
Better find who's right for me

You wanna hold me
If you really got what it takes
Why don't you show me
Go ahead boy go why don't you make my day
Cause I've been waiting
Long enough now it's time to take your place

Cause I need the right guy to be on the right side givin' it all to me

If you really want me
I demand your responsibility
If you really want me
Takes a lot of moxy to bring me to my knees
I said I said if you really want me
Get ready get ready boy, you should elbow grease
If you really want me
Prove yourself you gotta make it real to me

You betta werk 
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do

Step up to a cutie all the way turnt up
Talkin' bout blue collars â manual labor!
Gotta get a little dirty if you want my love
Cause I'm worth it yeah!
I'm so worth it yeah!

Let me see ya werk 
Break it out now werk 

What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do baby
What chu gon' go baby, tell me tell me watcha gon' do

You can't be pushin' up on it you betta werk if you want it 

You betta werk
