Look, I'm telling you as a friend
Because I think you're so nice
I really think a lot of you
Now you can let her wear your pin
You can let her your friend
But remember, whatever you do


Don't you let her
Be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't you let her
Be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't let her be your baby
(No, no, no, no, no, no)


Don't you know she's gonna
Kiss you (gonna kiss you)
Hold you tight (hold you tight)
She's saying she'll miss you
(She'll miss you) day and night
(Day and night, night and day)

She'll tell you that she loves you
(Sounds so sweet)
Make your temperature rise
(Temperature rise)
She says gonna hug you
(Gonna hug you)
Tell you no lies (tell you no lies)


When she puts her arms around you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) make you
Feel so fine, yeah


She'll be sugar and spice
(Sugar and spice)
Everything nice (everything nice)
And then, and then, and then
She's gonna break your heart
Like she did mine

Push, push, push, push


She'll put her arms around you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) make you
Feel so fine, yeah


She's sugar and spice now
(Sugar and spice)
Everything nice now (everything nice)
And then, and then, and then
She's gonna break your heart
Like she did mine


Don't let her be your baby
(Please be smart)
Don't you let her be your baby
(Have a broken heart)
Don't you let her be your baby
(You agree, if you agree)

Send her back to me
Send her back to me

Don't let her be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't let her be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't let her be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't let her be
