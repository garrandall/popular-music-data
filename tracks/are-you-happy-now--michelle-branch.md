Now, donât just walk away
Pretending everythingâs ok
And you donât care about me
And I know thereâs just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I donât care... yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye 
And tell me that youâre happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased, 
Are you happy now? 
Are you happy now? 

You took all there was to take, 
And left me with an empty plate
And you donât care about it, yeah. 
And I am givin' up this game
Iâm leaving you with all the blame cause I donât care, yeah, yeah yeah,

Could you look me in the eye? 
And tell me that youâre happy now, oohh oohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased, 
Are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now? yeah, yeah, yeah.

Do you really have everything you want?
You can't ever give somethin' you ain't got
You canât run away from yourself

Could you look me in the eye? 
and tell me that you're happy now, yeah, yeah
come on, tell it to my face or have i been replaced,
are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
are you happy now?

Would you look me in the eye?
Could you look me in the eye?
Iâve had all that I can take
I'm not about to break
Cause Iâm happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Are you happy now?
