{​Instrumental lead}​

It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin' when
It comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

{​Instrumental}​

Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world
Still looks the same
Another frame, mmm
