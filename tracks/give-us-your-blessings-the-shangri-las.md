Run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run
Jimmy, run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run

Mary and Jimmy were both very young
But as much in love
As two people could be
And all they wanted
Was to share that love eternally

They went to their folks they told them
That someday soon they'd be wed
Their folks just laughed
And called them kids
So Mary said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

They wouldn't have laughed at Mary
If they could have seen through the door
But Jimmy was waiting in the car
While Mary begged once more

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

Well as they drove off they were crying
And nobody knows for sure
That, that's why they didn't see the sign
That road detour

The next day they found them
Mary and Jimmy were dead
And as their folks
Knelt beside them in the rain
They couldn't help but hear
The last words that Mary and Jimmy had said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

Run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run
Jimmy, run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run
