Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know


And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that


Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home


And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me


Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know


Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home
