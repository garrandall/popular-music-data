Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room

Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room

Now she's gone
It's not about romance
She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for she body
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for she body

She looks so beautiful
She burns with every touch
Don't get too close
She'll break your heart and leave you
Got you wanting her so much
Take a tip from me
That girl don't love nobody

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for she body
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for she body

Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room

Bodies dancing oh so tight
Emotions running wild
Every move excites you
Can resist her if you try
It's clear but you can't see
That girl don't love nobody

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room
Boom chaka la ka boom boom boom
Gal you cause confusion when you walk ina the room

See that hunger in her eyes
Passions on the rise
Every move excites you
Can resist her if you try
It's clear but you can't see
That girl don't love nobody

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance
She don't love you
