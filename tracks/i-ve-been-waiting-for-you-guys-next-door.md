Yeahh..
Girl I've been searchin so long thru this world
Trying to find someone who could be
What my picture of love was to me
And you came along

When I saw you I knew you were the one
The love that I've been dreamin of

I've been waitin for you (waitin for you)
All my life for somebody who (somebody who)
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cuz I've been waitin for you

Girl I've been saving my love all this time
Cuz I knew someday I would find
The one that i've loved for so long in my mind

From the moment that I looked in your eyes
I saw the girl I've loved all my life

I've been waitin for you (waitin for you)
All my life for somebody who (somebody who)
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cause I've been waitin for you

Now that I've found you I just can't let u go (can't let you go)
No no no oh
Oh there's just one thing I want you to know

Spoken: girl I love you so...

I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
When I saw you I knew you were the one
The love that I've been dreaming of

I've been waitin for you (waitin for you)
All my life for somebody who (somebody who)
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cause I've been waitin for you

I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
(fade out)
