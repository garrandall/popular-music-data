Pearly shells (pearly shells)
From the ocean (from the ocean)
Shining in the sun (shining in the sun)
Covering the shore (covering the shore)
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells
For every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you

For each star that twinkles in the blue

For every grain of sand upon the beach
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
I've got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over
For each star that twinkles in the blue

(More than all the little pearly shells)
