Whatever gets you thru the night
It's all right, it's all right
It's your money or your life
It's all right, it's all right
Don't need a sword to cut thru flowers
Oh no, oh no

Whatever gets you thru your life
It's all right, it's all right
Do it wrong or do it right
It's all right, it's all right
Don't need a watch to waste your time
Oh no, oh no

Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me, come on, listen, listen

Whatever gets you to the light
It's all right, it's all right
Out the blue or out of sight
It's all right, it's all right
Don't need a gun to blow you mind
Oh no, oh no

Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me, come on, listen, listen
