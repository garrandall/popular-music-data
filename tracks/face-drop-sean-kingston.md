Kingston, hey, face drop, oh,
Kingston, I see your face drop, drop, drop

You touch my heart, disappear
I never knew how much it hurt here
(Made me feel like)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

First came trust, then came love
But this was none of the above, I'm aware
(Made me feel like)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, hey

But you're the one who said
That I'd be lost without you
(No, no, no, no)
You had your fun, couldn't write
This one without you, baby
(No, no, no)

And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out, hey

'Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner

Did all I can, I understand
That every girl do for their man
(Made me feel like)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

I cut it short, 'cause you got caught
You're not the girl you used to be no more
(Made me feel like)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

But you're the one who said
That I'd be lost without you
(No, no, no, no)
You had your fun, couldn't write
This one without you, baby
(No, no, no)

And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out

'Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner

Tellin' me come on back, what will I do from that?
I would still, still be yours if you knew how to act
But you underestimate a dude like me
And I love it when I see your

Face drop, I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
'Cause you always try to fill me with doubt

Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner

And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
(Thank you beautiful)
'Cause you always try to fill me with doubt

Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
(Thank you beautiful)
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
