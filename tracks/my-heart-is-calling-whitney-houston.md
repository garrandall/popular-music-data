Who would've thought of it
That I might feel like this
Some kind of wonderful
There's nothing quite comparable

The thing about it is
It's oh so innocent
I wasn't looking for
It came knockin' at my door

I'm trying to do things right
But I'm about to lose this fight
'Cause spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer
to my only reservationis you
My sweet temptation, baby.

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

Who could imagine it
I found my happiness
In someone I barely know
And I like to take it slow

But you're so diferent, boy
You're breaking all my rules
What is it in your smile
that makes me feel the way I do

I'm trying to live my life
And I'm trying to live it right
If I desire you
It ain't because I'm trying to

Boy, everyday with you
I swear it brings me closer to
My only reservation is you,
My sweet temptation, baby



I've given it consideration (uh huh)
And it all adds up to you
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby
I've given it alot of thought (uh huh)
And it all ends up on you
My sweet temptation
God knows I'm falling for you



Is is in your smile, boy
Is it touch, baby
I don't know why
