Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancin' through the night
The claim is on you
The sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed
Hey little girl
You want it all
The furs, the diamonds, the painting on the wall
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk

A French maid, foreign chef
A big house, with king size bed
You had enough, you ship 'em out
The dollars up, down, you better buy the pound
The claim is on you
The sights are on me
So what do you do, that's guaranteed
Hey little girl
You break the laws
You hustle, you deal, you steal from us all
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk

Moneytalks

Come on come on
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk
Come on come on, love me for the money
Come on come on, listen to the Moneytalk
