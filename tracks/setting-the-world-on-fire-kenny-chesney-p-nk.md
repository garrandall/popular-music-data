Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …


Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said "Do you think we’ll live forever?" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…


Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


Oh, yeah, yeah


Yeah, we were up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire


World all  on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
World all on fire
