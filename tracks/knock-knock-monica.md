Boy, it's a dangerous game
To try and play a chick like me {huhhh}
Wanna go out and do ya thing

So do just what you want
Any time that you really like

You'll be sleeping alone tonight

So don't you, knock knock knock (knockin', ooohhh)
Stop knockin', don't come knockin' on my door

My life support system
And I thought I couldn't breathe, uhh uhh

Big chains, gold teeth and your gleam on
All night wanna be gone
Wanna tell me stay home like I got a uhh ring on {wooo}
Then you say I'm not your wife, right right {huhh}
So why should I be chillin', goodnight goodnight {huhh}
Now pack up my things for a flight {ohhh}
