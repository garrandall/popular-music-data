I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you

I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light

Baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride

Without your love
I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love
A dog without a bone
What can I do
I'm sleeping in this bed alone

Baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

Baby, baby, baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and take me alright
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
