Why don't we both surrender
Before we both get burned
So many shots fired
So many daggers thrown

Can you think of anything
We have learned from all this menace
Have we learned from all this strife
Have we learned from all this business
With the gun and the knife

I throw up my hands for you
And if you throw up your hands for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I throw up my hands, my hands for you
And if you throw up your hands for me
What a wonderful world this could be, be, be

I remember things you whispered and things you screamed
Does it all go up in flames?
So many bombs dropped, so many names called
Can't you see we've been
Living in a world of pain from all this madness
Can we end it all before?
This world is pulled all to pieces in a tug-of-war

I fall to my knees for you
And if you fall to your knees for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I fall to my knees, my knees for you
And if you fall to your knees for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

Oh, let's both make a mutual surrender
Oh, let's both make a mutual surrender

Why don't we both surrender
Here before we both get burned
With all the shots fired
And all the daggers thrown

There's got to be something
We can learn from all this menace
Can we learn from all this strife
Can we learn from all this business
With the gun and the knife

I raise my white flag for you
And if you raise your white flag for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I raise my white flag, my flag for you
And if you raise your white flag for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I fall to my knees, my knees for you
And if you fall to your knees for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I throw up my hands, my hands for you
And if your throw up your hands for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I raise my white flag, my flag for you...
