I got a call. A telephone call today. 
Somebody's offering a job a thousand miles away, 
And I want to take it, it's the opportunity of a life time, 
But I need a second opinion, an opinion other than mine. 

So I, I'm turning to you, 
Because you always seem to know what to do. 
When times like these arrive, I call, 
On my only true friend in the world, my girl.

So I, I want to know, 
Should I really, really go,
And if so, Are you coming with me? 
I, I got to know, 
If you really want me to go, 
And if so, Come with me.

I never wanted anything as much as I want you with me. 
You were the one who said to follow my dreams, 
Of having a house, a car, a view of the stars, and a beautiful wife, 
So I need someone I can go with, 
I need some love in my life.

So I, I'm turning to you, 
Because you always seem to know what to do. 
When times like these arrive, I call, 
On the only real love of my life, you are my life.

I want to know, 
Should I really, really go,
And if so, Are you coming with me? 
So I, I got to know, 
If you really want me to go, 
And if so, Come with me.

I need you to
come with me
