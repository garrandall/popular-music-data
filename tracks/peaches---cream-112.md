So hot, hot
It's the S the L the I the M


Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna freak, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always again with you
So sweet, I can't forget
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout


Peaches and cream (Oh)
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
(Girl you taste so good to me)
Know what I mean, peaches and cream


I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby right next to you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
OhI love the smell of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

[Hook - 112 (Q)
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (oh
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (oh)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream


Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your arms around my neck and I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' - shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clique


Peaches and cream (Oh)
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (Girl you are tasty)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream
