I can see where I'm going
Although the road's not clear
Sometimes it don't seem so, but I know:
You can't keep a good man down!

I buy the paper nearly every day, but I-
Ain't got time to read it, you know-
Ain't no jobs for me in there now anyway but I know-
You can't keep a good man down!

You can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man-
You can't keep a good man down!

Please don't talk about the plans you've made, honey
I've made some plans myself... you know-
Sometimes the sign says stop but I go and you-
Can't keep a good man down! Listen-

You can't keep a good man down, yeah
You can't keep a good man down
I admit I'd rather fight than quit-
Can't keep a good man down!

Babe! Let's go!

Now take that rich boy who stays home all day, hehe
He's got so much, he really ain't got nothing to say
I'm on the streets and I cover the whole town
Ain't got no money, but you can't keep me down!
No way!

Please don't talk about the plans you've made
I've made my plans for me
You might lock me up, but I'm gonna break free-
You can't keep a good man down!

You can't keep a good man down, like I said now-
You can't keep a good man down, believe me
Don't get tough 'cause I can play too rough-
You can't keep a good man down!
You can't keep a good man down, like I said
You can't keep a good man down, you can't beat me-
I admit I'd rather fight than quit
You can't keep a good man down!
