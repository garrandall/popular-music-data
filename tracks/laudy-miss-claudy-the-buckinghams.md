Well, laudy, laudy, laudy, Miss Claudy
Well, you sure look good to me
Believe me this time, baby
You know I can't be free

I done give all my money
But you just don't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

I'm gonna tell, tell my mama
What you been doing to me
Believe me this time, baby
I'm in misery

Well, laudy, laudy, laudy, Miss Claudy
Well, you sure look good to me
Believe me this time, baby
You know I can't be free

I said bye, bye, bye, baby
You won't see me no more
Bye, little darling
Down the road I'll go
Down the road I'll go
Down the road I'll go
