Outside my window
You're walking by with someone new (outside my window)
Outside my window
The way I used to walk with you (outside my window)

Smiling while you're walking
Laughing while you're talking
Happy as can be (happy, happy, happy)
With your arm around him
You're so glad you found him
You never once look up to see me

Inside my window
I'm just as sad as I can be (inside my window)
Inside my window
I'm wishing you'd come back to me (inside my window)

Some day if you're lonely and you want me only
Here's what to do (what should I do)
Call me, my darling (darling)
Outside my window (window)
And I'll come running to you (outside my window)
(Outside my window)
