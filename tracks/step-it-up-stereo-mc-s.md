Dell, murderess world wind of wit 
get the worse of I break it down bit by bit 
Yet, a nerve my graphics cause seizures you slur, and your memory blurs 
A sure bet, Dell never fails clever tells 
the pear on his quest 
with the terrorist 
sending MC to the therapist 
my microphone will be a family heirloom hmm, 
awaits a white rappers dominate rappers on the scared straight after a clever track 
with exactlin flows that attract befores when it comes 
to rappers like smores that cause puke 
I duke newcomers and those who slumber (Ha Ha Ha) 
I under ones who's mostly dedicated to the leading of previous tedious trauma behind nothin faller 
Use the mileage A flavor fiddles with my pallet 
You know I can't allow it 
Bow if you recognize royalty 
My motor skills is more like a well oiled machine 
any team that we construct we'll blow your dreams up
in flames names all evaporated when my powers activated have to make it fun Think that you dunk me or dip me lift me, why'd you have to pick me when your
points strictly stripped your brothers of their props 
When I rock any facility with artillery like Attila 
you rap with all filler and I'm sure the crickets and fireflies Don't try to dispute we shoot straight and rarely miss 
and go anywhere we wish 
but MCs comin' up who can barely piss 
Watch what you say 
Watch how you think 
Watch how you act 

Fire in the hole stare into the glare 
the flare rips your retina no way to prepare 
for combat cock is sharp a Autobot
brain cells bust lines laced with angel-dust 
X-factor, X-men declare war 
Send your ambassador 
Send the whole peace core 
No shore carnivore attacks and concords 
Mutant assassins, and silent saboteurs
Let me take a stab at your track rewind it back 
Select or access code is hacked 
Rock steady reinforcement enhanced advancement 
Audiences senses audio transmit 
Thunderous storm strikes with ma jolt and 
all hard rock like Thing from fantastic four 
Prune beneath the moon lit rips solar eclipse 
madchild flips like kids on acid trips 



Unicaron formin the union all aluminum 
tracks by Dell just boomin on 
Quality systems all of these tracks we can't list em, 
ditch em. fuck em, reluctant to kick bullshit 
put the fold it like the narrows wearing sombrero chip up the weapons blowing up some Winnebago with bitches under the stagecoach age old definition of
pimping 18A, it's a raping in the date game that they may change in break dames in the high speed make them want to try me but never give Mikey the ties
the unlikely slice me as being forward walks by us shy, caller, holler at me fool that's a cool sack but you can't loose black too fast straight from the
ton and down the prove that but you knew that remember how we do that you whack

I'm the unread lock corner storming professor X 
my neural networks best like what works 
lets first analyze the 21 gun sound
then realize that if it's stereo I won't be surrounded Astounded and amazed praise like two common 
I have nothing in common with the layman 
and the plane I shake magic like a shaman on a red clay plate 
I'm uncommon and way beyond Darwin 
The ultimate test of aptitude is my universal appetite of altitude
triple tons terms you climb when I rhyme 
Newton's apple had worms 
but there's a killer on the road 
so you should read the signs 
come to terms with the modern man of clarity 
an MC of rarity truly a rock odyssey 
gotta see I'm odabe an a mentally parking me follow me 
if you'd be angels where fools fit a tread in they only see my back cause I'm three steps ahead of them 
look at em dead in the eye 
their as crooked as a cloud in the sky 
well I'm the who, what, why, where, when of sewer rats multiply 
more plagues will descend 
I wore like the kin like they wore like Lord Shin
(What you tryin to say Prev) 
Yo let me try this again 
As high as we ascend I woke break a bend 
my soul was carried by the crow but delivered by the red Key my played like sound bytes speak Wordsworth 
like ten at the scientist experiments I prevail as win
