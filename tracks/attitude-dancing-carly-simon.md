There's a new kind of dancing
that's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage

Cop a different pose
From the pose you're in
Shine a different attitude
From underneath your skin

Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Attitude dancing
Any attitude is the proper attitude
Attitude dancing
Don't be afraid to change your attitude
Attitude dancing
Free up your spirit with a new attitude

It don't even matter
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes

And it don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Only one thing matters:
That's your attitude
Your attitude, attitude dancing

Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Attitude dancing
Learn to move in another attitude
Attitude dancing
Find the groove in a new attitude
Attitude dancing
Don't be afraid of a new attitude

It don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Only one thing matters:
Is your attitude

Your attitude, attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a new attitude
Do the locomotion in a new attitude
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Do the hully gully in a new attitude

Find a role you like
Capture it and freeze
Then turn it around
A hundred and eighty degrees
Or if you're at a loss
Observe some natural dude
And turn into a mirror of his attitude
Attitude, attitude, attitude
Dancing
