Now everybody's talkin' about all the brand new dances
But I've got 3 that I'm gonna do for you, lord have mercy

I'm gonna start with a dance now, baby, called the boogaloo
You know that one, don't you?
Everybody's groovin', baby; it's gonna move you too
Lord have mercy, get it! Get it, get it, get it, get it, ow!

Gonna make you feel all right
I'm gonna move up & down & do the skate, look here baby
& when you get that feelin', baby, you're gonna look real great
Lord have mercy
Oh help me! Help me! Ow! Get it, get it, get it, get it, ow!

Wait a minute, everybody, look a-here! I've got a brand new dance
The whole wide world now, baby, is doin' the shing-a-ling
You've heard about it, ain't you?
When you move your hips, lord have mercy, & raise your hand
Look here now, baby
Shake it from side to side, baby; that's the shing-a-ling
Oh I like that one; now get it, get it, hey! Lord have mercy
Do the shing-a-ling now, baby; wow ow!
Get it, get it, get it, lord have mercy, do the shing-a-ling
