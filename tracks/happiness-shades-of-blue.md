The dying flames of love are slowly flickering
Upon the walls of dreams I built around you
They slowly sail away leaving scars of loneliness
And my wealth will be a million shades of blue

My tears will fall on any abuse in you of the rose colored love that we once knew
My plan for happiness will soon be all ashes
And my wealth will be a million shades of blue
