It's gonna be a lonely school year
I'll sing it again
It's gonna be a lonely school year

Baby, Baby can't you finish what you started
It's not that bad
Don't go call me when your broken hearted
Open up, I gave you everything that I had

CHORUS
It's gonna be a lonely school year
I'll sing it again
It's gonna be a lonely school year

Listen girl this is the last time I'll tell you-- I'm not mad
Wasting time was the way that we liked it
Come September remember we got to get back

CHORUS

Because he loves her
I don't care if everyone knows it
Because he needs her
Cause I am the kind of guy that would show it
Ya ya ya
Don't miss the love because I love you baby, love you baby

CHORUS

Repeat Chorus to fade
