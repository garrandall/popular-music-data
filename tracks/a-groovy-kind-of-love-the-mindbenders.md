When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
And then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me
I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing
In my ear
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Anytime at all
When I taste your lips
Oh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love

I love you
I love you
I love you it's true
When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
And then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
If the whole world could shatter
I don't care

Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
