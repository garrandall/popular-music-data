When I'm feelin' blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue

When you're close to me
I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to, anytime at all

When I taste your lips
Oh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love

When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
If the world would shatter, I don't care

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love
