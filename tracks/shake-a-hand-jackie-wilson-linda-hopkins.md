With Linda Hopkins
Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
And I'll take care of everything
Your troubles, I'll share
If you lemme know
I'll be there
Honey, I'll stay close to you
Any place nad anywhere
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand every day
Shake a hand if you can
Be truthful to me
And I'll be truthful to you
And I'm in love with you so
And I don't know what to do
Well, let's call it a day
I said about all I have to say, baby
Except, don't forget to pray
And shake a little hand every day
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
C'mon, shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand every day of your life
Shake a hand if you can
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
One more time
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand
C'mon
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can
