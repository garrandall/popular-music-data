There is never a time to say
'Cause it seems to me we've lost our way
So we carry on down the road
When we live our lives haunted by

All the things we say and do
Keep on missing when I'm alone
With you

No there's never a time to change
You don't get a chance to rearrange
It's a long, long way to go..
Just to find out something we both know

Can't you see what's going on?
It's so sad that a love so strong
Has gone

All I know is what is true
All I ask is for you
To just look around and see

You live your life locked in a dream
Where nothing is real and not what it seems
We can't go on another day
Just being afraid to say

'Cause it's a long, long way to fall
When we both thought we had it all
When you know there's a time to say
'Cause we're all played out; We've lost our way!

All I hoped that you would be
Was so understanding, and by now you'd see
But oh no...

So sad, ohh, so sad
That's the way that it goes, I know

I'm gonna tell you right now...

(end)
