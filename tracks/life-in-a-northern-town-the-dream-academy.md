The Salvation Army band played
And the children drunk lemonade
And the morning lasted all day
All day

And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away
Oh


Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma


They sat on the stony ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down
To listen

He said in winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles

Yeah, yeah


Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
All the work shut down


The evening turned to rain
Watched the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down
To the station

And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight
Bye-bye


Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town

Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Ah hey ma ma ma ma

Make it easy on yourself
Society's so
So hard to desert
So hard that you know
Make it easy on yourself

Life in a northern town
We'll get back up
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
(repeat to fade)
