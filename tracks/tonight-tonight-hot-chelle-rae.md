It feels like a dream
The way you're looking at me
Letting your eyes do the talking

There's no need for words
You wear my Van Halen shirt
Dancing like nobody's watching

You pull me close 
And now I know
This is where I wanna stay

Yeah, frozen in time
Your lips on mine
I feel like we could float away

Take me higher and higher till I can't breathe
I don't need air when you're kissing me
You make my world feel like paradise
And you're all I need tonight

Take me higher and higher, we're off the ground
There's no turning back and we can't slow down
We're falling in love at the speed of light
And you're all I need tonight

I brush the hair from your face
My other hand on your waist
Just like a scene from a movie

Clothes start hitting the floor
Before we get through the door
I'm finally right where I should be

You pull me close 
And now I know
This is where I wanna stay

Yeah, frozen in time
Your lips on mine
I feel like we could float away

Take me higher and higher till I can't breathe
I don't need air when you're kissing me
You make my world feel like paradise
And you're all I need tonight

Take me higher and higher, we're off the ground
There's no turning back and we can't slow down
We're falling in love at the speed of light
And you're all I need tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all I need tonight
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all I need tonight

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Take me higher and higher till I can't breathe
I don't need air when you're kissing me
You make my world feel like paradise
And you're all I need tonight

Take me higher and higher, we're off the ground
There's no turning back and we can't slow down
We're falling in love at the speed of light
And you're all I need tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all I need tonight
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all I need tonight
Yeah, You're all I need tonight
