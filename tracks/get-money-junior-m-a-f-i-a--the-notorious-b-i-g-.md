Mafioso, mafioso
Mafioso, what, uhh, mafioso uhh
Mafioso, uhh, mafioso, what, uhh


Check, how you figure that your team can affect my cream
Gold and platinum plaques since I stepped on the scene
Knahmean, peep the scene
Jacuzzi full of women (uhh)
She hitting me and him and him, much love like Wimbledon
While niggas screaming killa, I'm overseas in my villa
With my masseuse, nothing illa
Frank switch the plan, cop the Lexus Land
C-Gutta, Rockafella, 400's and better (uhh, uhh)
Lil' Cease push threes with fives in his eyes
Knocking Not Gon' Cry by Mary Blige
I die for my niggas packing steel, chickenheads with sex appeal
Reveal sexual acts up in Capone's Ac' (what?)
The chocolate dimes watch the M.A.F.I.A. shine
Uhh, girls get your own can't touch a dime of mine


And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money)
And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money), uhh, uhh


Big Momma, keys in Tijuana (uhh)
Some call me Donna Karan or Armani
Gats by the poonani
For brown-nose pussy crushers
Cap peeling lovers, ignorant motherfuckers
Drive a Benz, no Miata (uhh)
This honey's got a sweet pi√±ata, six-shotta, damn
Lil' Kim the Black Erika Caine and
Who remains in Chanel frames and
Animals of all kind
Russian Fendi sables (what?)
With matching pool tables
Read the label - M.A.F.I.A
Admiring my shoes by Gucci
I be eating sushi, playing with my coochie
Counting lucci, nigga I got banks to rob
Convertible Saab, I'm married to the mob


And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money)
And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money), uhh, uhh


Frank White the Desperado
Used to rock the all-black Movado
The all-black El Dorado
All that and a bottle of Dom P (uhh)
Niggas can't harm me, I keep the army
Is Brooklyn in the house? Without a doubt (uhh)
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
Check it out: guns, I bust 'em
Problems with my wife, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Lear jets, I lust them
Fingerprints, I dust them (uhh), recent address (what?)
Stuck you for your stash in your pissy mattress (uhh)
Your mom's an actress, didn't wanna show me the safe
It's okay, she was old anyway!
I display (uhh), Hot97 rhyme-ready
Cock MAC-11, line steady (what?)
Like Tevin Campbell, I'm ready (uhh)
To do what I do, continuously to (get money)


And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money)
And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to (get money)
You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst, so don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money), uhh, uhh
