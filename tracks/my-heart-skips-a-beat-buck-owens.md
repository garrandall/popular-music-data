Oh, my heart skips a beat as we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat as we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, you came into my life without a warning
You turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Oh yes, you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat as we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
