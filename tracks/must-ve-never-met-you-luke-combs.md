Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you


Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you


"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"


I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"
Must've never seen the other side
"What don't kill you makes you stronger"
Still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl"
"You win, you lose, you find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you
