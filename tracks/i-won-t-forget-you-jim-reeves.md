Dear SeÃ±or Santa Claus I think I tell you what
I would like for Christmas and I hope you wont forgot
I only want a peso that I can have for mine
To get my seÃ±orita something for Christmastime

I don't believe you read the card last Christmas that I sent
You come to see the kids across the street and then you went
Dear SeÃ±or Santa Claus I think me understand
Sometimes the toys all gone before you reach the Rio Grande

Dear SeÃ±or Santa Claus I tell you what I think
I no got a stocking', I'll set out my piggy bank
So please bring me peso that I can have for mine
To get my seÃ±orita something for Christmastime

On Christmas eve I watch for you and I no sleep a wink
If I no get Lolita something she feel sad I think
So please SeÃ±or Santa Claus this Christmas be so grand
If I get peso to buy a ring for my Lolita's hand

I don't know what I buy for her, I think I buy a rose
So she can wear it in her hair most everywhere she goes
Please SeÃ±or Santa Claus this Christmas be so grand
If I get peso to buy a ring for my Lolita's hand
