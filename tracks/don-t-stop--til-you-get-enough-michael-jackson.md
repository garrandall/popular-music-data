You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force
It’s got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah
It make me feel like… oh


Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperatures rising now
Power is the force, the vow (Oh power)
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why (Oh)
So get closer (Closer now)
To my body now
Just love me
Till you don't know how (Oh)


Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough


Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain’t nothing like a love desire (Oh)
I'm melting (I'm melting)
Like hot candle wax
Sensation (Oh sensation)
Lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining (Ah)
Cause this is love power (Oh)


Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough




Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal (Oh eternal)
Love shines in my eyes (Oh)
So let love take us through the hours (Oh, let love)
I won't be complaining (No, no)
Cause your love is alright, alright (Oh)


Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop (Don't stop, baby)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (Oh, my baby)
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough


Lovely is the feeling now I won't be complaining (Oh, oh)
The force is love power


Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop (Don't stop, darling)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop (Don't, baby)
