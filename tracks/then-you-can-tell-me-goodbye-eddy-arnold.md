Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you'll just wait a lifetime before you leave
But if you must go I won't say no
Just so we can say that we try

Tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
Then you can tell me goodbye
