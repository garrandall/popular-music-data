Outside my window a robin builds a nest
At last winter's gone away to rest
Once again the leaves have return to the trees
I can just feel that soft summer breeze

There's magic in the air
Winter's disappeared, it's summer

Children will be playing in the park
Days will be longer till the dark
Nights will be warm with star filled skies
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy

There's magic in the air
Green grass every, everywhere it's summer

Don't you know it's summer time
And the livin' is easy oh, so easy
Everybody sing summer time

Now that summer's here there be million things to do
Vacation near or far, whatever pleases you
Summer is the happiest season of them all
So everybody get together and have yourselves a ball

There's magic in the air
Green grass every, everywhere, it's summer

There's magic in the air
Green grass every, everywhere, it's summer

It's summer time
Magic in the air
Green grass everywhere, oh, it's summer

Take a look around you
It's summer time
Magic in the air
Green grass everywhere, oh, it's summer
It's summer time
