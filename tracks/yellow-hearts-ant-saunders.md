She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes a train, I'll let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say
That we were more than friends (Oh)
Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon?
I thought this was as good as new

She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
Her favorite color, like the stars (Like the stars)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (She put yellow hearts around my name)
I said she was a work of art (I thought they were all just the same)
I didn't listen very hard (To you, what do they really mean?)
When she told me she was crazy from the start (Have you only been playing games?)

Have you only been playing games?
No, no
