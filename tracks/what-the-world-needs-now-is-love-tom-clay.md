Man: What is segration?
Kid: I don't know what segration is
Man: What is bigotry?
Kid: I don't know what bigotry is
Man: What does hatred mean?
Kid: I don't know what that is
Man: What is prejudice?
Kid: Mmm, I think that is when someone is sick


Anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone


Anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed lotta people
But it seems the good they die young


Anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where he's gone


What the world needs now
Is love sweet love
No not for some
But for everyone

Man: What is segration?
Kid: I don't know what segration is
Man: What is bigotry?
Kid: I don't know what bigotry is
Man: What does hatred mean?
Kid: I don't know what that is
Man: What is prejudice?
Kid: Mmm, I think that is when someone is sick
