All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work


Lil Tunechi get that moolah-lah-lah-lah, lah-lah-lah-lah
Back in the kitchen for that moolah-lah-lah-lah, lah-lah-lah-lah
Woah, fly under the radar with my goon, goon, bada
Ain't from Jamaica but we true two shotta, Buju Banton
Nigga I stunted, got that shit back so quick, didn't even miss it
Nigga, I'm hustlin'
Nigga, we hustle, pardon the flexin'
Strongarmin' niggas and kissin' my muscle
Back in the kitchen


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work


Moolah, moolah, moolah
I'm the chef and the jeweler
Write your hoe off on my taxes
But I'll never buy a shooter
Send a platinum plaque to my plug
Tell that nigga, "Put it on the wall"
Accomplishment, a hall of hustle
We done did it, we done sold it all
It go middle finger, middle finger to the law
Loyalty is what I'm preachin' to my dawgs
Loyalty what I'm expectin' from the broad
Lawyer fees for all my dawgs behind the walls


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work


All I ever had was the cocaine
My cousin Leeroy was the dope man
In the GT switchin' four lanes
On the stove whip the coke up like propane
On the block where the shots go "bang!"
Only real niggas really gon' hang
All my life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ay!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work
We whip out that work, whip out that work


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah
And stack my change up then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
