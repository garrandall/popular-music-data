Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Ayy, get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)


All I ever had was the cocaine (Ayy)
My cousin Leeroy was the dope man
And GT switchin' four lanes (Skrrt)
On the stove whip the coke up like propane (Ayy)
On the block where the shots go "bang!" (Brrt)
Only real niggas really gon' hang (Bang, bang, ayy)
All my life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ayy!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work (We whip out that work)


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Ayy, get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)


Got the trap house bumpin' (Ayy)
First in the month where the kids run (Ayy)
Got the whole block jumping on fire
Name on ring when I come through (Hey)
Addicted to moolah, no favors (Ayy)
This feel like a hell of a day bro (Ayy)
I'm falling in love with that coco (Coco)
This shit is runnin' my veins and my whole soul (Whole soul)
Got the whole block in a choke hold (Choke hold)
Middle finger to the po-po (Po-po)
Cool is so coola, addicted to moolah (Moolah, hey)


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Ayy, get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)


We been standin' on the corner, ayy
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
Just to get that moolah
Just to see that moolah
Standin' on the corner
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Just to get that moolah
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
We been standin' on the corner, ayy
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
Just to get that moolah
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' on the corner
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Just to get that moolah
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)


All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah (Get that moolah)
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler (See the jeweler)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work (I whip up that work)


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
