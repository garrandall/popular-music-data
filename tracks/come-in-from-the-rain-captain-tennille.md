Well, hello there good old friend of mine
You've been reaching for yourself for such a long, long time
There's so much to say, no need to explain
Just an open door for you to come in from the rain

It's a long, long road when you're all alone
And a man like you will always choose the long way home
There's no right or wrong, I'm not here to blame
I just wanna be the one who keeps you from the rain
From the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're all right
Time has left us older, and wiser
I know I am

And it's good to know my best friend has come home again
'Cause I think of us like an old cliche
But it doesn't matter 'cause I love you anyway
Come in from the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're all right
Time has left us older, and wiser
I know I am

'Cause I think of us like an old cliche
But it doesn't matter 'cause I love you anyway
Come in from the rain, come in from the rain
