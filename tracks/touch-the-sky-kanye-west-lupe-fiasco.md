I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos'd hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the Lox (locks)
Now let's go

Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apartment

Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about a hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob a hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine

Jay favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am."
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in a accident 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say "I get it"
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket

Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"

Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

Now I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl!
Testify
Come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky


Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third
Hear like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm tryna stop Lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, touchÃ© Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
Sky, sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high

Keep it rolling
Feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!
