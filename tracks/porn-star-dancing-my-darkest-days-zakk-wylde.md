Kelly won't kiss my friend, Cassandra
Jessica won't play ball
Mandy won't share her friend, Miranda
Doesn't anybody live at all?

Amanda won't leave me empty handed
Got her number from a bathroom stall
Brandy just got way too much baggage
And that shit just gets old

But I got a girl who can put on a show
The dollar decides how far you can go

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
Cuz that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage for this
Porn star dancin'

Your body's lightin' up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
There's nothing hotter than a..


Stacy's gonna save herself for marriage
But that's just not my style
She's got a pair that's nice to stare at
But I want girls gone wild

But I know a place where there's always a show
The dollar decides how far you can go

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
Cuz that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage for this
Porn star dancin'

Your body's lightin' up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
Let's throw a party just for two
You know those normal girls won't do


They won't do, I need a girl that's kinda frisky
Drinking with the fellas, takin' shots and gettin' tipsy
Always wanna party cuz she's sexy as hell
And if I ever get in trouble bailin' me outta jail
Cuz she a stone-cold stunner, hotter than the summer
When she step up in the club every man and woman want her
She make me wanna get a stripper pole up in my home
Cuz her porn star dancin' has got me in the zone

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
Cuz that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin right by the stage for this
Porn star dancin'
