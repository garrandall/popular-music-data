Your scars were still showing
When I first met you, baby
From all the wrong
She had done to you

Then I came along
And applied a little loving
Slowly but surely
I brought you through

But now she's back
To rekindle that old flame
She's got a different angle, baby
But she's playing the same old game

Baby, don't be a victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
She's trying to make me her victim too

Now I know she comes round here
Every time I leave (look out, baby)
'Cause she knows she's still
On your mind (got her on your mind)

Even a wise man jumps in misery
Somewhere down the line (listen, baby)
But only a fool would jump
The second time

Our affair is growing
Stronger every day
Don't let her come and
Steal our happiness away

Baby, don't be a victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
Trying to make me a victim too

Oh, baby, don't be a
Victim of a foolish heart
Don't let that girl get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
She's trying to make me her victim too

Don't let her do it
Don't you be a victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
