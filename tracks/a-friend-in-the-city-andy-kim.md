Did you really think
That it wouldn't show
You can't look me in the eye
Sometimes, I wish I didn't know
Cause it's enough to make me cry


You have a friend in the city
Now there's no need to deny you do
You have a friend in the city
And I can't take more
Of what I'm going through

I know about all your shopping sprees
And all those Wednesday matinees
Darling, give me some credit, please
I wasn't born yesterday



Baby, while I told myself
Try to smile and control myself
Well, I'll be just a moment more
But not another day, okay

It's gonna hurt to let you go
But it would hurt more
To let you stay

Go to your friend in the city
And tell him things
Have worked out fine
He can have you all the time

You have a friend in the city
Now there's no need to deny you do
You have a friend in the city

You have a friend in the city
You have a friend in the city, oh
