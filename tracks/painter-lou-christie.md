Painter
Put my hurt on paper
Make the colors lonely
From gold to gray

Paint her shadow walking away
(Walking away) paint the
End of the world today

And paint me crying on my knees
Paint the trees without no leaves

Green for my envy
Red cause I'm angry
Gray for depression
Losing love was my lesson

Paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Paint me mixed up

Abstract twist her heart
And pay her back
Let the colors run together
Is this my life forever
Forever, forever

Paint me on the back streets
Of town (backstreets of town)
She started my world spinning round
(Backstreets of town)

And paint me crying on my knees
Paint the trees without no leaves

Silver for my tears
Blue for the comming years
Yellow for the good times
Life has no reason or rhyme

Paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Paint me mixed up

Paint me crying on my knees
Paint the trees without no leaves

Black for her gown of lace
Beside her, an empty space
The chapel bells that he erased
From now on, I'll wear a false face

Paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Paint me mixed up

Paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
Come on, come on, paint me
