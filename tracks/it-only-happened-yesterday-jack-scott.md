It only happened yesterday
And already I miss you, my dear
If I had known I'd be alone
Do you think that I would've let you go

It only happened yesterday
And already I'm losing my mind
I was smart, I broke your heart
Mmm-mmm, foolish boy

Love like this love I have for you
Will never, my dear, ever die
Alone am I, alone I'll be
Yet these lonely nights have got the best of me

It only happened yesterday
Forgive me if I cry
I'm on my knees, I'm begging please
Forgive me for yesterday
(I'm on my knees)
I'm begging please
Forgive me for yesterday
