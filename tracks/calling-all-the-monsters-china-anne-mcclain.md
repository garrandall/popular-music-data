Callin' all the monsters, callin' all the monsters
Callin' all the, callin' all the, callin' all the monsters

Oh yea aye, oh yea aye, oh yea aye

Heart thumps and you jump
Comin' down with goosebumps!
You dared to go there
I'ma I'ma get you so scared!

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Eh eh

If you stayed in too late
To be getting afraid
This scene's extremeâ¦
I I I I'ma get you so scared!

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Eh eh

Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken

Here we goâ¦
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
If you're only dreaming
Why I hear you screaming?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
We're comin' to get ya!

Callin' all the monsters, callin' all the monsters
Callin' all the, callin' all the, callin' all the monsters

You hide or you tryâ¦
Kiss tomorrow goodbye!
We thrill to your chillâ¦
B-B-B-Buckin' for a freak-out!

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Eh eh

We might just bite underneath the moonlight
More fun if you run!
I-I-I-I'm I'm already chasin'

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Ehh ehh

Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken

Here we goâ¦
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
If you're only dreaming
Why I hear you screaming?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
We're comin' to get ya!

Callin' all the monsters, callin' all the monsters
Callin' all the, callin' all the, callin' all the monsters!

Gonna paint it red, get inside your head, head, head
Like a demon choir playing with fire, fire, fire

Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken

Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
If you're only dreaming
Why I hear you screaming?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to get ya!
We're comin' to get ya!

Oh yea aye, oh yea aye, oh yea aye

We're comin' to get you!
