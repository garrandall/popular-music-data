Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
Calling all, I'm calling all, I'm calling all the monsters


Uh, ye-ah (Oh)
Uh, ye-ah (Oh)
Uh, ye-ah (Oh)
Eh-eh


Heart thumps and you jump
Coming down with goosebumps
You dare to go there?
I'ma, I'ma get you so scared
(We're wanting to)
(Yeah, we're haunting you)
(Yeah, we're wanting to, ye-ah)

If you stayed in too late to be getting afraid
This scene extreme
I-I-I-I'ma get you so scared
(We're wanting to)
(Yeah, we're haunting you)
(Yeah, we're wanting to, ye-ah)


Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken
Here we go...


Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
We're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
We're comin' to getcha


Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
Calling all, I'm calling all, I'm calling all the monsters


You hide, or you try
Kiss tomorra' goodbye
We thrill to your chill
B-B-Buckinâ€™ for a freak out
(We're wanting to)
(Yeah, we're haunting you)
(Yeah, we're wanting to, ye-ah)

We might just bite underneath the moonlight
More fun if you run
I-I-I-I'ma, I'ma already chasin'
(We're wanting to)
(Yeah, we're haunting you)
(Yeah, we're wanting to, ye-ah)


Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken
Here we go!


Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
We're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(We're comin' to getcha)
(We're comin' to getcha)


Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
I'm calling all, calling all, I'm calling all the monsters


Gonna paint it red
Get inside your head, head, head
Like a demon choir playin' with fire, fire, fire


Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken


Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(Ah yeah-eh-eh)
And we're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'? (Why I hear you screamin'?)
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
(We're comin' to getcha)
(We're comin' to getcha)


Uh, ye-ah (Oh)
Uh, ye-ah (Oh)
Uh, ye-ah (Oh)


Coming to get you
