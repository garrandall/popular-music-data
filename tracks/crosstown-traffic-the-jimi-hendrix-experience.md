You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride


You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town


I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead


You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
