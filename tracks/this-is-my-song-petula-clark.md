Love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
The world cannot be wrong
If in this world there's you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you

Why is my heart so light
Why are the stars so bright
Why is the sky so blue
Since the hour I met you

Flowers are smiling bright
Smiling for our delight
Smiling eternally
For the world, you and me

A love when I sing in moonlight
With you in my heart supreme
To hear you say "I love you"
That is my hope, my dream

So love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
The world cannot be wrong
If in this world there's you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
