Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I pace back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, you should've known
You should've known

That you're not a princess
This ain't a fairytale
You're not the one I'll sweep off their feet
Lead you up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood
This is a small town
I was a dreamer before I went and let you down
Now it's too late for me and my white horse
To come around

And baby I was naive
Got lost in your eyes
I never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
I had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That you're not a princess
This ain't a fairytale
You're not the one I'll sweep off their feet
Lead you up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood
This is a small town
I was a dreamer before I went and let you down
Now it's too late for me and my white horse
To come around

And there I am on my knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging you please
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause you're not my princess
This ain't a fairy tale
You're gonna find someone, someday
Who might actually treat you well
This is a big world
That was a small town
There in my rear-view mirror
Disappearing now
And it's too late for me and my white horse
Now it's to late for me and my white horse
To catch you now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch you now
Whoa, oh
It's too late
To catch you now
