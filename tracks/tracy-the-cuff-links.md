(I look up towards the sky, it's like I'm going under
Can feel the ground, it's like I'm saying goodbye
Although I try to make it right, I just make it harder
If you don't love me, there is no real reason why)
Maniac

Had a leng one named Sharna
But she's always out in drama
I don't do dates, no starter
Tex'in my phone, miss me like karla
But she can't be bae
Done too many man, EBK
Bro's in the kitchen, GBK
This slate light brown, not T-E-A
And I got a peng ting named Zara
But she's always out with next man
Why you don't take me Sahara?
Babe, it's a myth cah I see you with them man
How's my man bad for his BM
But on the wing you was doin' up VOVO
Tex'in my phone in PM
Doin' up hair, she's tryna get promo
And S got a pack in his Grey Goose
But that's not weed, it's Ciroq
Slow down B, that's Gucci
There's no way you can sleep in my top
Stop tellin' your friends 'bout us
Like, who knows what they must think
When she phones I press red button
You know we don't cuff links
If I was in a cell
Would you wait 'til I get home?
Now I gotta send my G mail
'Cause he got nicked with a chrome
Not me, it's you
Like I ain't got feelings too
Hurt when my friend got life
But it can't be goodbye for good
She says I'm a t'ug
But I know you gotta thing for guys in the hood
Cah you still wait up in the AM
And you've seen then tings in my DM
And I got your old tings preein'
Like, they still wanna know who you're seein'
Ask why I'm always in Harrods
I don't wear it twice, go check my 'gram
Caught her likin' my pictures
I swear I thought she was a fan
But nuttin' like my ting from Streatham
We used to talk all night on my tizzy
Remember when you were sendin' me pics in your letters
Everyone thought you was pretty
Ay, remember that gov called Tracy?
Shout out my door like, "Miss"
"I'm tryna go halves on a baby"
Born in the '90's, trap like '80's
Need a lightskin like Paigey Cakey
I just seen two tings in a A3
She's like, "Hi, my name is Amy"
But miss, wagwan for your friend?
It's always the slim ones tryna act shady

(I look up towards the sky, it's like I'm going under
Can feel the ground, it's like I'm saying goodbye
Although I try to make it right, I just make it harder
If you don't love me, there is no real reason why
I don't understand
It's getting harder to know what to say
Running out of air
It feels like you're walking away)
Maniac...
