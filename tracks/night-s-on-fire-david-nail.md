Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows sheâs gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, itâs a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Dayâs gone and the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs a seat laid back, a boyâs dream
Drawinâ hearts in the window steam
Sheâs a gettinâ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what youâre headed to
Whatâs a red blooded boy to do

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
