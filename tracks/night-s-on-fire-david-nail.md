Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she's gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it's a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan


You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day's gone and the night's on fire


She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh, ooohh


She's a seat laid back, a boy's dream
Drawin' hearts in the window steam
She's a gettin' you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you're headed to
What's a red blooded boy to do


She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh


You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh, oohh
