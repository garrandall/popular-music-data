Take your little heart
Tear it all apart
Make the teardrops fall
From your eyes

And you'll know how I feel
When she holds you
Whenever she holds you

Pretend no one loves you
Make believe you're blue
And if you get an empty
Feeling deep inside

Then you'll know how I feel
When she holds you
Whenever she holds you

My friends say forget you
I know I should try
But whenever she holds you
I feel I could die

But if you ever find
That I'm still on your mind
Maybe you'll come back to my arms

Til then, I'll cry
When she holds you
Whenever she holds you

Whenever she holds you
