Trains and boats and planes are passing by
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome
For someone else, but not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

We were so in love and high above
We had a star to wish upon wish
And dreams come true, but not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

You are from another part of the world
You had to go back a while and then
You said you soon would return again
I'm waiting here like I promised to
I'm waiting here, but where are you?

Trains and boats and planes took you away
But every time I see them I pray
And if my prayer can cross the sea
The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me

The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me
