Dry your eyes, there's no need to cry
I am so sorry but bye, bye, so long
Mother's gotta go now

I am so sorry to see you cry
Wipe those tears from your eyes, so long
Mother's gotta go now

It's been so long
Since you've been gone away
And baby when you come back
You'll be home to stay

But in the meantime
I'm so lonely and so blue
Why don't you tell me now, tell me now?
What am I gonna do?

I am so sorry to see you cry
Wiping those tears from your eyes, so long
Mother's gotta go now

Dry your eyes
Bye bye, baby
Dry your eyes
Don't cry, baby
