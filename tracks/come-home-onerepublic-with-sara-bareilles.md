Hello, world
Hope you're listening
Forgive me if I’m young
For speaking out of turn
There’s someone I've been missing
I think that they could be
The better half of me
They’re in the wrong place tryin' to make it right, yeah
But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home
Ooh


I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see
The world ain't half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons, all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well, hopefully, the hate subsides
And the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
Until then


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home
Ooh


Everything I can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why I need you here
Everything I can’t be (Everything I can’t be)
Is everything you should be (Everything you should be)
And that’s why I need you here
So hear this now


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known (Ever known)
So come home


Come home
Come home, come home
I've been waiting for you
Come home
