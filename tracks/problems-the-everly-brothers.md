Problems, problems, problems all day long
Will my problems work out right or wrong
My baby don't like anything I do
My teacher seems to feel the same way too

Worries, worries pile up on my head
Woe is me I should have stayed in bed
Can't get the car my marks ain't been so good
My love life just ain't swingin' like it should

Problems, problems, problems
They're all on account-a my lovin' you like I do
Problems, problems, problems
They won't be solved until I'm sure of you
You can solve my problems with a love that's true

Problems, problems, problems all day long
Problems, problems, problems all day long
