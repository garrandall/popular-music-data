Oh, my darling
Come next Sunday
We're getting married
Just you and I

And I can't wait
To hear you promise
That you'll love me
Until you die

And I wanna hear you say
(Oh, yes, I do
You know I do
I do love you)

I will pledge you
My devotion
Darling, by your side
That's where I'll stay

And I promise to protect you
As we travel on the way

And I just wanna hear you say
(Oh, yes, I do
You know I do
I do love you)

Oh, my darling
I wanted so much
For you to be my wife
And when I walk down the aisle
Seeing all my friends
And family smile at me

I wonder deep down in my heart
Will I ever be worthy of you
And, oh, how I wonder
If you realize that I'm gonna
Dedicate every night and every day
Of my life making you happy
If you ever said those
Precious words to me

(Oh, yes, I do
You know I do
I do love you)

Oh, my love on your finger
I'll place a ring
Making you mine
And we'll vow to one another
Our love will last til
The end of time

And I wanna hear you say
(Oh, yes, I do)
One more time
You know I do
I do love you)

Oh, yes, I do...
