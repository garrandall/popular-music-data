I used to cry in the middle of the night
Baby hold me tight
There was nobody beside me when I opened my eyes
Now I've turned the color of those days and nights
Now somethings inside me changed and I think I might be starting over
I don't wanna run
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby

If ever I could love, I think it could be with you
If ever I thought Id find somebody so true
I wonder if you feel the same way that I do
If ever I could love I think it could be with you

You know I cant read your mind my love but it seems to me
Your heart and mine tonight are defying gravity
Somethin' so familiar its still so unknown
The closer that I get I swear it feels like coming home
I ready to be brave
Oh yeah, When you look at me and say

If ever I could love, I think it could be with you
If ever I thought Id find somebody so true
I wonder if you feel the same way that I do
If ever I could love I think it could be with you

If ever I could love, baby
If ever I could love
If ever I could love

If ever I could love, I think it could be with you
If ever I thought Id find somebody so true
I wonder if you feel the same way that I do
If ever I could love I think it could be with you

I still never forget when the baby came and she walked out of my life
And got hurt so bad
I swore Id never let another get inside this heart of mine
But she touched my hand and everything plan I had disappeared like a falling star
Now theres a new beginning and Im moving to the rhythm of a new and braver heart
A braver heart
If ever I could love, oh oh 
If ever I could love, yea yea
