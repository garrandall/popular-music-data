Top 40, news, weather and sports
Top 40, news, weather and sports

Last night I was
Getting my homework up
And listening to my radio

I was kinda sleepy
But was writing my theme
While I was digging my DJ Show

It was Top 40, news, weather and sports
And I was writing on current affairs

Next morning when I
Got up to read my theme
You should have seen
All the classroom stare

I had Lumumba doing the Rhumba
To the tune of the Blue Tango
I had Abominable Snowman hunters
A-bringing in Fidel Castro
I had President Ike up at the mike
Singing, Are You Lonesome Tonight

I had the U.N. lost
In a snow out west
And Khrushchev squealing
You talk too much

And there was Brenda Lee
Running track for state
And there was Kennedy
Giving a station break

And the guys down at Canaveral
Were shoveling snow
Hollering, let's go, whoa, whoa

Top 40, news, weather and sports
Top 40, news, weather and sports

And I had Mickey Mantle
Riding on a camel
Through the rains
Down in Death Valley

I had Mr. Nehru
At the weather bureau
Giving the humidity

And I had Lolita
Humming mighty sweet-a
New Orleans off key, key, key
Rockefeller singing acappella
Save that little ole dance for me

Top 40, news, weather and sports
Top 40, news, weather and sports
