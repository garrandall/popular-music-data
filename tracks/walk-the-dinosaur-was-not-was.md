Boom boom acka lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka lacka boom boom 

It was a night like this forty million years ago
I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey skull to go
The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice
I felt a little tired, so I watched Miami Vice

I walked the dinosaur, I walked the dinosaur


Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur 

Boom boom acka lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka lacka boom boom 

I met you in a cave, you were painting buffalo
I said I'd be your slave, follow wherever you go
That night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the stars
You fell asleep, I stayed awake and watched the passing cars

And walked the dinosaur, I walked a dinosaur




One night I dreamed of New York
You and I roasting blue pork in the Statue of Liberty's torch


Elvis landed in a rock-rock-rocket ship
Healed a couple of lepers
Ah, and disappeared


But where was his beard?





A shadow from the sky, much too big to be a bird
A screaming, crashing noise louder than I've ever heard
It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar
Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar

I killed a dinosaur, I killed a dinosaur


Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur 


Boom boom acka lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka lacka boom boom
