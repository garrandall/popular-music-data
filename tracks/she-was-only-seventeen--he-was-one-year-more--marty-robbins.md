She was only seventeen and he was one year more
She loved him with all her heart and he the girl adored
But all their friends believed they're too young to know the score
'Cause she was only seventeen and he was one year more.

Are they old enough to know if love will last for life
Isn't he too young to be a husband her a wife
Well in the past I bet it's happened more than once before
When someone was seventeen another one year more.

Do we have the right to question love that seems so strong
As long as God has no objections there can be no wrong
Let us be the first to wish them all the very best
Let us hope their love is strong enough to meet the test.

'Cause like I said I bet it's happened more than once before
When someone was seventeen another one year more.

Do we have the right to question love that seems so strong
As long as God has no objections there can be no wrong
Let us be the first to wish them all the very best
Let us hope their love is strong enough to meet the test.
