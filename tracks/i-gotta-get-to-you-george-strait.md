I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me


I'll win you over, over and over again
I'm getting closer, closer than I've ever been


I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me


I'll keep on trying, trying and I'll never give up
I would be lying if I said we were close enough


I gotta get to you 'cause you've sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting
Gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting
Gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
