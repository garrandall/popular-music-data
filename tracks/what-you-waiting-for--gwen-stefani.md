What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by?
Now it's only me


Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick tock, tick tock
(La la la la la la la...)


Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh-oh


What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?


Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Take a chance you stupid hoe


Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place? (Uh-huh)
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out 'cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (For sure)
Life is short, you're capable (Uh-huh)
Oh, oh-oh


Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!


What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?


I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style... go!


Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!


What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?


What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
