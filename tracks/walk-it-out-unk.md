Now everybody leanin, I made the crowd rock
Now 'gwan and walk it out, I see they on my jock
She want that bubblegum, is they the Doublemint Twins?
Two hoes choosin' me, so I know that I'mma win
It's on once again, Patron once again
I threw my hair back, then I froze like the wind

The Southside just got it, Northside stuck in it
In the club, on the deuce, big stacks, no flex
These suckers wanna try me tell 'em tool on deck
He walkin' in his one steady smokin on fruits
She walk in with a friend, all in her snow boots
So (Shit!) There they go (Hey) they walk it on the flo'
Grey Goose, double shots, it'll let your body go
My niggas on my side, haters hate, think it's funny
I walked it on these niggas now I'm gettin' to my money
Froze on them hoes, I'm not talkin 'bout dancin'
Ho count 'pon the charm, diamonds steady stead' enhancin'


Now walk it out (Now walk it out) now walk it out (Now walk it out)
Now walk it out (Now walk it out) now walk it out (Now walk it out)
Now Westside walk it out (Now Westside walk it out)
Now Southside walk it out (Now Southside walk it out)
Eastside walk it out (Eastside walk it out)
Northside walk it out (Northside walk it out)
Now walk it out (Now walk it out) now walk it out (Now walk it out)

Okay, do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out

Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Ayyyyyyyyyyyy!
