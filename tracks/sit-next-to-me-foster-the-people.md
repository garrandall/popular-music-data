And it's over, it's over
I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger
Feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you said "What's up?"
And pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you
But we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober
Symptoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger
Last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted
And I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you

I'm saying come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I'll take you high, high

Well I ain't frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you said
"You wanna keep it light"
But I'm here to tell you
I'm not trying to change your mind
It's alright, oh, it's alright, oh

Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I'll take you high, high, high, high

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

So come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

It's alright
