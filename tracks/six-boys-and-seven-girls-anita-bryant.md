There were six boys and seven girls
Only six boys and seven girls
Six boys and seven girls
At my sweet sixteen affair

Six couples danced by
And I wanted to cry
Cause you
You weren't there

Six boys and seven girls
What a dreamy friendly scene
The lights were down low
They were kissing
I know
While I played the record machine

Where were you, my darling?
Where were you last night
I hunger for two arms to hold me so tight

Six boys and seven girls
Six boys and seven girls
At my sweet sixteen affair

They left two by two
And I still looked for you
But you, you, you weren't there
