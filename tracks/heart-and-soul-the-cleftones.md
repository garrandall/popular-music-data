Heart and soul
I fell in love with you
Heart and soul
The way a fool would do

MadlyYeah
Because you held me tight (Held me tight), held me tight (Held me tight)
Held me tight (Held me tight), held me tight (Held me tight)
And stole a kiss there in the night

Heart and soul
I beg to be adored
Yes, and I lost control
And tumbled overboard

GladlyYeah
That magic night we kissed (That we kissed), oh, we kissed (That we kissed)
Oh, we kissed (That we kissed), oh, we kissed (That we kissed)
There in the moon mist

Oh, but your lips were thrilling
Much too much too thrilling
Never before were mine so
Strangely willing
Darling, and now I see
What one embrace can do
Come on and look at me
You've got me loving you

MadlyYeah
That little kiss you stole (You stole), oh, you stole (You stole)
Oh, you stole (You stole), oh, you stole (Yes, you stole)
All my heart (You stole) and soul (Yes, you stole)
All my heart (You stole) and soul (Yes, you stole)
Oh, you stole (You stole) oh, my heart (Yes, you stole)
Oh, you stole
