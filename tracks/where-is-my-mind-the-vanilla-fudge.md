Where is my mind

Where is my mind
A passing breeze, it looked at me as it would blow
I felt a fire chilling in my mind below
The spirits laughed as when I told a joke
I felt the light shine on my face and I awoke

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

When the birds would sing off key it was their sign
That the water in the fountain turned to wine
A burning bush, it spoke to me as it would glow
And it personifies something that we all know

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Come on

Oh, where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
...
