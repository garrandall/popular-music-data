I could jump off a bridge and let you walk over me
I tend to stay inside myself, I don't want you to take over me
I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai
I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai


Dubai shit, Dubai whips
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Yeah, yeah)
Oh well, like like who that is (Straight up)
Yeah, Dubai shit, Dubai whips (It's lit)
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Alright)
Know me well, know who that is (Yah)


I don't know, where to go (Yah)
Life 'round here is just hysterical (Oh no)
J. Will here, know he sneakin' O's (It's lit)
Give those here, you can't handle those (It's lit)
Enemies, M.I.A. (Yeah, yeah)
At Ace of Diamonds with Ace of Spades (Yah, yah)
We at Club White, ain't no Mandalay (Yah, yah)
You can't get in, nah (oh)


Dubai shit, Dubai whips
Different place (Different), different chips (Yeah)
A-T-L, this shit ludicrous (Luda'), yeah (Ayy)
Know me well, they know who that is (Quavo)


Trampoline (Trampo'), Michael Jordan dreams (Jordan)
Half a bale in that vacuum clean (Bale)
Abu Dhabi on them jet skis (Skrrt, skrrt, splash)
Want straight cash, no checks please (Cash)
Shoot out that coupe (Brrt), what you gon' do? (Who?)
I'm handin' out allowances to all my goons (Gang)
In Dubai, I'm smokin' cookie in the hotel rooms (Cookie)
Got me paranoid, think it's an Esco move (Dubai)


Dubai shit, Dubai whips
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Yeah, yeah)
Oh well, like like who that is (Straight up)


Oh, yeah, birds fly high out in Dubai
Ridin' all these jet skis in Dubai (Ayy)
So much money, my jet ski gold (Oh yeah)


Fish bowl (Fishes), Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
I played with Montana and Rice before (White rice)
Huncho not tellin' no lie, oh, it's so hot in Dubai
I see your soul in your eyes (Soul), I let the opium dry (Drank)
Good drank (drank), mixed with antidote (Anna')
I put her on Molly, Cac' put her on snow (Montana)
Never was a fan of the O's (No), came from the land of the Nawf'
Whippin' the pan on the stove (Stove), whip it 'til your hand grow mold (Yeah)


Dubai shit, Dubai whips
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Yeah, yeah)
Oh well, like like who that is (Straight up)
Yeah, Dubai shit, Dubai whips (It's lit)
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Alright)
Know me well, know who that is (Yah)


I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai
I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai
