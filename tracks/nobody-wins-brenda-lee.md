Well it's over, and nobody wins
Well it really doesn't matter
Who's right or wrong?
We've been hustling each other for much too long
And it's too late to try to say, what might have been
It's over, and nobody wins
Make believe and forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder, each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistakes again and again
Oh it's over, and nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The love it was easy, it's the living that's hard
For there's no need to say to see the way it is
Oh, it's over and nobody wins
