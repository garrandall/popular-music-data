Well, it really it doesn't matter
Who's right or wrong
We've been hurting each other
For much too long
And it's too late to try to save
What might have been
When it's over, nobody wins

Make believing in forever
Is such a line
And it seems a little sadder
Each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same
Mistakes again and again
Oh, it's over, nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
But loving was easy, it's the living that's hard

For there's no need to stay to see the way it ends
Oh it's over nobody wins
