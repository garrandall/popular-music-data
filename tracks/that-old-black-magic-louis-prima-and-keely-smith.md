Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
And down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love

Under the old black magic called love
