(You got what it takes you can win)

You got what it takes you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here, don't you quit
The moment is now, this is it
I know that you can then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind

That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's gonna kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down

But today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

Life's gonna kick
It's gonna kick you around
It's gonna kick you down

Brush yourself up, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or less
Just go out and give it your best

Today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

Today is your day
