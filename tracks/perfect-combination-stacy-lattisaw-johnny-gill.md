Two hearts together
We're a harmony so right
Two sparks united
We're a fire burning bright

For that you're always brand new
Right from the jump we had a hunch
That we had everything

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together

So deep
Inside we share a feeling that's so rare
So sweet
Just knowing that we are a special pair

We're right on time
We're two of a kind
And heaven knows this love will grow
Stronger every day

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
Perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together

We can conquer any mountain
(Oh, baby)
Just as long as we're together
(Oh, oh)
'Cause as one we are an endless fountain
Overflowing with love
(Hey, hey)
Perfect love
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Perfect combination
(Ooh, baby, hey)
Lovers you and me
(Oh, oh, oh)
A perfect combination
(Hey)
We couldn't ask for any better
(Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, no

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Oh, oh

Perfect combination
(Perfect, perfect, yeah, combination)
Lovers you and me

(Lovers you and me, yeah)
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
(Hey, hey, hey)
No, no

Baby, yeah
(Yeah)
Ooh...
(You and me, yes, just you and me, yeah... )
Baby

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
