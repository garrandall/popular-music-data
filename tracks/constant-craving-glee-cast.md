Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin

And constant (Constant) Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always) Been

Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls to what's true
Or maybe it is life itself
Leads wisdom to its youth

Constant (Constant) Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always) Been

Craving
Ah...constant craving
Has always been
Has always been

Constant (Constant) Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always) Been
Constant (Constant) Craving (Craving)
Has always (Always) Been

Craving
Ah...constant craving
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
