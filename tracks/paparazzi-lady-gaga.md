Stuntin' all day
Swag on a hundred million
Private plane like Lady Gaga
Sip champagne like Lady Gaga
Sold-out show like Lady Gaga
Big bank-roll like Lady Gaga
Iced-out wrist, iced-out chain
I'm deep off in the fuckin' game,
Everybody knows my name,
Diamond ring like Lady Gaga
Diamond ring in your face,
Fuck your face, trick bitch
Fuck your life, trick bitch 
I'm caked up and I'll fuck your wife
Fuck your life you bitch ass trick

I'm posted it in the trap
Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap
Cake like Lady Gaga
Cake like Lady Gaga
Cake like Lady Gaga

Cake like Lady Gaga
I'm posted it in the trap
Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap
Cake like Lady Gaga

I roll all the good shit,
You rollin' on that Reggie Bitch
I roll like Lady Gaga
Lady Gaga in this bitch
I roll all fuckin' day
Donatella on your hoes
Donatella got them clothes
Donatella that's fo' sho'
Chopper in the chopper on the way to a sold-out show
Lady Gaga bitch ass trick
I put that on my Papa Joe
I'll mop you all across the floor
Snatch your fucking weave out bitch
In front of paparazzi, singing paparazzi in this bitch

I'm posted it in the trap
Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap
Cake like Lady Gaga

Fuck the world like Lady Gaga
Run the world like Lady Gaga
Phantom pearl like Lady Gaga
Burqa swag like Lady Gaga
Twitter on 30 million, under 30 hundred million
30 million fans straight, fannin' like my children chilin'
Ask my man, Hedi at Yves about EMI, 
Ask anybody
I'm rich, homie I got plenty
Shut shit down like Lady Gaga
Iced-out crown and Miuccia Prada
I son, you son, ask your father
Skull tattoo I hate your daughter

Ayo, I'm lady gaga.
You know I'm lady gaga
Lazer cut up, ladder mesh
Mugler show I'm lady gaga
Bad bitch is gonna walk the runway
Walk bitches like lady gaga
Ortenberg, you can suck my dick
Walk, bitch, you ain't lady gaga
Nicopanda got style, trick
Cathy Horyn, your style ain't dick
Walk a mile in these foot high heels
I run in these, you ain't running shit
You chew beef, I wear meat
And stay on top of...
I'm getting fat and so is my bank
I'm on a sold-out world tour, bitch

I'm posted it in the trap
Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap
Cake like Lady Gaga

Strapped with the AK
Aimin' at your fitted cap
