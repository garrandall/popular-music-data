Our friends all ask me
The last time I saw you
I smile and tell them
It's been a day or two
There'll be no way to explain it
The way that I miss you
And my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue

I talk to your picture
My favorite one of you
I wish that you were here with me
But what good would it do
Having no way to tell you
The pain that I've been through
Oh, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blues
Yes, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
