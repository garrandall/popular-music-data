Lil Uzi Vert
Brown Boy

Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Big house, that's a crib, that's a estate
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face

Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Say I'm broke, I throw a hundred in your bitch face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face


(Lil Uzi)
Yeah nigga, you know me (Ooh)
Margiela all on me (Me)
Diamonds, they wet like the sea (Sea)
Rick Owen all on my feet (My feet)
Fuck that bih' once then I leave (Mmm)
I fuck that girl in a week (Yeah)
No, no, no, I won't repeat (Yeah)
Give me that Panamera key (Yeah)
First off, my whip not a lease (Yeah)
Your girl on me, I need a leash (Aye)
I fucked your bitch right on the beach (Yeah)
She sucked me like  (Yeah)
My pockets, they stuffed but they deep
Givin' pressure, my diamonds on fleek (Yeah)
The chopper there right on my seat (Yeah)
A Bentley truck, this not a Jeep (Ooh)
What are those right on your feet?
Yours' bubbles, I got a crease
Touchin' that bitch, you get leaked (Mmm)
I fucked the bitch in the sink
Slippin', they had me on skates (Ooh)
I fucked that bitch in the Wraith (Yeah)
I fucked that bitch in the faux (Yeah)
I fucked that bitch in the mink

Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Big house, that's a crib, that's a estate
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face

Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Say I'm broke, I throw a hundred in your bitch face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face

I've been hittin' models, baby you are not my first
Goyard cost me thousand, baby this is not a purse
I should drive around my city in a hearse
'Cause I'm dumpin' rap careers off in the dirt
Got matching Perfect Timing rings with Lil Uzi Vert (Bling)
Upside down crosses, we might just get hit with a curse
Yeah, you know we put in work like A$AP Ferg
I made a lot of guap and I want what I think I deserve
It's the brown boy, you know me
Molly and codeine
I know six Michelles, yeah
I know five Maries
Make a pie and sell them P's
Bought my mom Celine
XO like the mob, capisce
You can't get a feature
Your bitch look like a creature
Won't touch her, I don't feel her
Drive in my two-seater (Skrrt)
Treat it like a beater
My diamonds clear, light defects
Pockets lookin' greener
Drug dealers were my teachers (The plug)


Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Big house, that's a crib, that's an estate
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face

Flexin' on them, that's my mistake
Say I'm broke, I throw a hundred in your bitch face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face
Wrist straight, walk around with a big face


I just bought a chopper that came with a beam
This the type that might blow you to smithereens
Drive like it's stolen when I'm rollin' off the beans
Not talkin' millions of the money, what you mean?
Tell me what you mean
