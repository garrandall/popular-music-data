What you doing tonight?
I wish I could be
A fly on your wall
Are you really alone?
Who's stealing your dreams?
Why can't I breathe
You into my life? (So tell me)
What would it take
To make you see that I'm alive?


If I was invisible (Invisible, invisible, invisible)
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am


Saw your face in the crowd
I call out your name
You don't hear a sound
I keep tracing your steps
Each move that you make
Wish I could be
What goes through your mind (Oh baby)
Wish you could touch me
With the colors of your life


If I was invisible (Yeah, yeah)
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am


I'd make you mine tonight (Invisible)
I'd make you mine tonight


I reach out
You don't even see me
Even when I scream out
Baby, you don't hear me (You don't hear me)
I am nothing without you
Just a shadow passing through
(Invisible, invisible, invisible, invisible, invisible)
Oh


If I was invisible (Whoa)
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight (I would make you mine)
If hearts were unbreakable (Hearts broke)
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)
If I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)
If I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)
If I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)
If I was invisible (I'd make you mine tonight)
