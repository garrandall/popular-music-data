My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby

When you quit me baby
Tore me all apart
You gave my love to someone else
Now I've been stabbed in the heart

My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby

Won't you tell me baby
Tell me why I went wrong
Why must I be used all my life
Why must I be scorned

My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby

One thing pretty baby
I never will understand
How can you look me in the eye
And hold hands with another man

My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby

My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
