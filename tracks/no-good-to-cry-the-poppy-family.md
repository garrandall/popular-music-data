I hear a new boy came to town
And now your baby ain't nowhere around, yeah
Now you think you're in despair
You feel that still the cold light's clinging in the air, yeah

(Chorus)
Love's a game you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say
She won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby
Well, don't do no good to cry, yeah yeah yeah

How you think I'm over you
You left me there you never said a word except that we're through, yeah
You didn't fight it all the way
Oh I don't care you just don't mean that much to me this way, yeah

(Chorus X 2)
