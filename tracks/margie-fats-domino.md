My little Margie
I'm always thinking of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your promise to me
I have bought a home and ring and everything

For Margie, you've been my inspiration
Days are never blue
After all I said and done
There is really only one
Oh Margie, Margie, it's you

Margie
I'm always thinking of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your promise to me
I have bought a home and ring and everything

For Margie, you've been my inspiration
Days are never blue
After all I said and done
There is really only one
Oh Margie, Margie, it's you
