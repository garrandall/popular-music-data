(Farrar/Ritenour)
You keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
I don't wait for everyone
This is a one-time situation
You say you need me
I believe you need
But you're fooling no one
This is a one-time situation

What does it matter
Who's been taken in
Ah, what does it matter
When you've got two hearts
Aching to begin

Here's the opportunity
Come and take it to the nth degree
Don't be nervous, I don't have to be
Tied up in promises
Ooh, tied up in words that cut too deep
Tied up in promises we could never keep
I don't wanna let you down
Don't make me let you down

I get a feeling
A head-to-toe feeling
There's something special going on
This is a one-time situation
Take my affection
Give me love or rejection
Honey, do what must be done
This is a one-time situation

What does it matter
Who's been taken in
Ah, what does it matter
When you've got two hearts
Aching to begin

Here's the opportunity
Come and take it to the nth degree
Don't be nervous, I don't have to be
Tied up in promises
Ooh, tied up in words that cut too deep
Tied up in promises we could never keep
I don't wanna let you down
Don't make me let you down

This is a one-time situation
This is a one-time situation

Don't get me tied up
Don't get me tied up
