You acting like you hate me
Where is your love?
You do too much complaining
Where is your trust?

Flyin' in a Wraith, yeah
Pass by time through the day, yeah
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah
Just me and my bae, yeah
One shot, get the racks out the safe, yeah
We gon' party too late, yeah
Do the dash in a whip on the trace, yeah

All these straight diamonds on froze, get a migraine
Life on the edge, live it up on the high lane
Me and Trippie Redd back to back on the same thing
Late night, turnt in the club doing my thing
Sip drank, get a cup, I'ma pour the whole thing
Shawty playin' games, she don't wanna sell her soul, man
Sayin' that she love me but I'm knowing that she don't, man
Playing back and forth, probably thinking I'm dumb, man
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout a bitch, nigga, worry 'bout a check
Nigga, VVS diamonds, lil' nigga had to flex
Nigga hoppin' out the 'Rari them I'm hoppin' in the jet
Bad lil' bitch all on my dick, I want the neck
Aye, she want the dick, I don't want sex, I want the neck
Aye, me and YoungBoy tossing these hoes, we want the neck, aye
Whole full moon in the middle of the day
I done jumped out my sleep, heard the phone go ring
Back to back, we be flippin' these on a train
Keep a pole, we never be playin' no games
Diamonds gon' shine, put an 8 on my chain
I done ran up the money, stay true to the gang
Diamonds, they shining, that's all through the rain
Through all the mud and through all the pain

You actin' like you hate me
Where is your love?
You do too much complaining
Where is your trust?

Flyin' in a Wraith, yeah
Pass by time through the day, yeah
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah
Just me and my bae, yeah
One shot, get the racks out the safe, yeah
We gon' party too late, yeah
Do the dash in a whip on the trace, yeah
