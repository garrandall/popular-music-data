And suddenly my world
Is filled with sunshine
And suddenly my life
Is going so fine

I, I, I used to be
Such a lonely guy
I cried until you
Came into my life

And suddenly my days
Are filled with laughter
And suddenly I've got
The girl I'm after

I (I) I (I) finally found
What I'm looking for
Love (love) sweet love (love)
Come around knocking on my door

And suddenly my world
Is filled with sunshine
Suddenly my life
Is going so fine

I (I) I (I) finally found
What I'm looking for
Love (love) sweet love (love)
Come around knocking on my door

And suddenly my days
Are filled with laughter
Suddenly I've got
The girl I'm after

And suddenly my life
Is going so fine
And suddenly my world
Is filled with sunshine
