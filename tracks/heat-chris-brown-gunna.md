Super wet, her juice is runnin' down her knee, uh, uh

Got you flodgin' with a icy Patek Philippe, oh, oh
Pretty pies inside the mansion by the beach (Beach)
Fendi prints all on your bathin' suit, your style is so unique (Your style is so unique)
Fifty bands inside your room, designer garments for the week (Week)
And that's all on me, I swear, that's all on me (It's all on me)
