She takes him in her arms
She kisses his face and lips

There's only one woman in the world
One woman with many faces

She takes him in her arms
She kisses his face and lips

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make her express how she feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a king on a throne
Make her love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make her express how she feels
Then you'll know your love is real

There's only one woman in the world
One woman with many faces

Long stemmed roses are the way to your heart
But she needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make her express how she feels
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself (There's only one woman in the world)
You've got to make her
Express herself (One woman with many faces)
Hey, hey, hey, hey

So if you want it right now, make her show you how (There's only one woman in the world)
Express what she's got, oh baby ready or not (One woman with many faces)

And when you're gone she might regret it
And think about the love she once had
Try to carry on, but she just won't get it
She'll be back on her knees

To express herself
You've got to make her
Express herself
Hey, hey

There's only one woman in the world
One woman with many faces

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make her express how she feels
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make her
Express herself
Hey, hey, hey, hey

So if you want it right now, make her show you how (There's only one woman in the world)
Express what she's got, oh baby ready or not (One woman with many faces)

Express yourself
Respect yourself
Hey hey
So if you want it right now, better make her show you how
Express what she's got, oh baby ready or not

Express yourself (There's only one woman in the world)
One woman with many faces

She takes him in her arms
She kisses his face and lips

She takes him in her arms
She kisses his face and lips

She takes him in her arms (There's only one woman in the world)
She kisses his face and lips (One woman with many faces)

She takes him in her arms (There's only one woman in the world)
She kisses his face and lips (One woman with many faces)
