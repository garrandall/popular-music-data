You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
You tore off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snow, but you can't fool me, we both know who you are


Homeboy your gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side, ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty, little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me just do this for me brother, come on homeboy

I's haulin' this hay, Uncle Joe's farm
Thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death



You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it alright
Before they're called...homeboy

Homeboy
Come on homeboy
Homeboy
Come on homeboy
