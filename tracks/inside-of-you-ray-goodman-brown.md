Sometimes it seems like
I just can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

You and I are as close as two is two three
And we're growing closer together
We found that magic seed, better than love
And it will grow forever and ever

(CHORUS):
Every day love grows (every day love grows)
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh, I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

(Repeat 1st verse)
Our love is like a house on a firm foundation
That's standing on solid ground
We build a wall of love and trust all around us
And no one can tear it down

(CHORUS)

(REPEAT 1ST VERSE)
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

(CHORUS)

(REPEAT 1ST VERSE)
Seems like I just (seems like I just)
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you (to you)
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

(2x)
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

It seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
