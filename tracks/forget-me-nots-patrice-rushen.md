Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last
Memories of love and affection
Never really was just like a dream
Was it the simple things
That made me so crazy about you
Was it your charm or your passion
It's not hard to believe
I love you and I need you so I

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Did we give up too soon
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance we could love again
She'll always love you forever
It's not hard to believe
I want you and I need you so I

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
Baby please forgive me not

Good times we had...
They weren't so bad...
What a life we shared...
Pretty baby I still care...
