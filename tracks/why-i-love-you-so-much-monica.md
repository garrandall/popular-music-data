Oh, oh, baby
Ah, oh


You mean the world, oh, and everything that I want for
Since I've been your girl, oh, my whole life has been much better than ever before
You got a tender sweet love, yes, you do
That weakens me and takes over me whenever we touch


Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
I love only you


Now you say that you're down
Oh, you said you won't play around
No, no, not with my heart
And when your boys come around
No, you're not disrespectin' me
And not tryin' to be Mr. Wanna-be-hard
You let them know that I'm yours, yes, you do
By holdin' me and kissin' me
Lets them know that for sure


Baby, that's just why I love you so much (Why I love you)
Baby (Baby, that's just), that's just why I can't get enough (Whoa, oh-oh, oh, yes)
Baby (Baby, that's just), that's just why I love you so much
I love only you


Yes, you don't ever say I'm too young for you, baby
I've been around enough to know enough to know just what I want
You don't move too fast or make me rush, no
One day we're gonna talk about making love
No doubt, baby, when the time is right


Baby, that's just why I love you so much (I love you so much)
Baby (Baby, do you hear me?), that's just why I can't get enough (I can't go nowhere without you, baby)
Baby (No, no-no-no-no-no), that's just why I love you so much (Yes)
I love only you


Baby, no one else can do
What you're doing to me
You take me and you hold me
You rock me in your arms, baby
And I love you for that, baby
You don't front in front of your friends
And you're smart enough to be a real man
And I love you, and I love you
And I love you for that, baby


Baby (Baby, baby), that's just why I love you so much (You can't stop givin' it to me)
Baby (Baby), that's just why I can't get enough (No, no)
Baby (Baby, baby), that's just why I love you so much (Yeah)
I love only you (Yeah)
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
