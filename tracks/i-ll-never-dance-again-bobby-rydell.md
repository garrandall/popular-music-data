My soul was a-swayin' to the beat of your heart
And your lips were sayin' that we won't dance apart
Now someone else is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again., whoa oh no

Oh I've danced with others just to show I don't care
But my arms discovered that the thrill wasn't there
Unless my arms are holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again whoa oh no

I'll stay off the dance floor till mem'ries grow di-i-i-i-m
'cause my heart would break to see you take every step with him

I'll survive seein' ya sighin' on that shoulder of his
Oh how I've been cryin' knowin' how sweet that is
So while that guy is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
I will never, no no I'll never never dance again-oh I'll never

No, darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
No, darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
Say baby no I will never whoa-oh I'll never never dance again
Hey baby no I will never no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o I'll never never dance again
NO BABY NO I will never
