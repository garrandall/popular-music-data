This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore


This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct


Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better


When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know


Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better


Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together


It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise


Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better


Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together


This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore
