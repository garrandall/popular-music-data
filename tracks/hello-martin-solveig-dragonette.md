I could stick around and get along with you 
Hello 
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you 
Hello 

You're alright but I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
Don't get too excited 'cus that's all you get from me 
Hey 

Yeah I think you're cute but really you should know 
I just came to say hello 
Hello 
Hello 
Hello 

I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
Hello 
Imma let you try to convince me to
Hello 

It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
It's ok with me if you don't have that much to say 
Hey 

Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
I just came to say hello 
Hello 

Hey 
Hey 

I could stick around and get along with you 
Hello 
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you 
Hello 

(I'm here darling to enjoy the party) 

I just came to say hello 
Hello 
Hello 
Hello 

I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
Hello 
Imma let you try to convince me to 
Hello 

It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
It's ok with me if you don't have that much to say 
Hey 

Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
I just came to say hello 

Hey
