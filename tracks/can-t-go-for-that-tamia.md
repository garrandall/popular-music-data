Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Yo, yo, yo uh)

Why you got an attitude?
(Uh-huh, yo)
Why you acting all foolish?
(Uh-huh, yo)
When you see me out in the street boy
(Ugh)
You wanna embarass me, call me names
Slap my face until
Until you see my friends come, oh
Then you wanna try to console me, oh
(Uh-huh, yo, yo)
But they already know boy
(They already know boy)
Cause for the last week I've been in the house
And I've cried and cried

Chorus
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't go for that
Can't go for that

Now you bring me flowers
(Uh, what?)
You say you got it together

(Uh, yo)
Soon as I let my guard down
(Ugh)
Oh there you go again
In my grill till I call the cops then
Then you wanna chill out and say
(Oh, say what?)
I'm the one who's buggin'
(Oh)
But, no, no it's you, you see
(No, no, it's you, you see)
Every time I go out
You come grabbin' all over me


Why you trippin?
Get your hands off me
Why you illin?
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen

Why you trippin?
Get your hands off me
Why you illin?
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen, oh

Chorus Until fade
