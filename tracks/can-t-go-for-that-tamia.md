Mmhmm mmhmmm  i loved you, 
I loved you (more) when you had no money (more) use to say i love you (more) baby all i need
Is, More time and more mind, i loved you (more) every day was sunny (more) use to think about
You (more) baby all i need is more time and more mind

Just another day im not being in your way so im all alone.. all alone ooh yea, just another
Week we dont hardly speak but im holding on stop treating me so wrong, Give me your loving,
Give me your mind, Give me your kissing, give me some time, cuz i cant live my life if my heart
Walks out your life, Give me your loving, Give me some eason, Give me your kissing, Give me a
Reason, to make me wanna stay wanna go back to the day i loved you, 


(more) when you had no money (more) use to say i love you (more) baby all i need is,
More time and more mind, i loved you (more) every day was sunny (more) and i was thinking of
You (more) baby all i need is more time and more mind

Dont make me twist your arm to stay alittle me will be okay, Walk out the door,
Ohh-Woahhh-Ohh, I think its time i found  that guy, I can rely on day and night, To be by my
Side baby, And be a real man to his lady, Give me your loving, give me your mind, Give me your
Kissing, give me some time, cuz i cant live my life if my heart walks out your life, Give me
Your loving, Give me some eason, Give me your kissing, Give me a reason to make me wanna stay
Wanna go back to the day i loved you,


(more) when you had no money (more) use to say i love you (more) baby all i need is,
More time and more mind, (i loved you) (more) every day was sunny (more) use to think about you
(more) baby all i need is, more time and more mind


Look, Now you got your gucci groupies, good girls too, And your,
Hoochie cuties and your hood girls who, they just wanna support their own man a strong man, She
Just aint in it for the bread like stroll man, And what you dont do, The next dude will, Trust
Me, You aint trying to see it the next dude will, So while you gotta (woo) you better treat her
Nice as hell before she never coming home like life in jail, She a yellow road she shine like
Yellow gold, she got the heart and the covert like she walked in the yellow road, You on her
Bad side and the only way to make up is spend more time and two rollies and a jacob- 
Tamia: A girl like me, is so hard to find, Hope you see before its too late, What you had in
Me, Now some other guy, Will be holding me Tonight, Tonight 


I loved you, (more) when you had no money (more) use to say i love you (more) baby all
I need is, More time and more mind, i loved you (more) every day was sunny (more) and i was
Thinking of you (more) baby all i need is more time and more mind    

I loved you, i loved you, i loved you, (tamia) i loved you, i loved you, i loved you
