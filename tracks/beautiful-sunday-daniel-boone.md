Sunday morning, up with the lark
I think I'll take a walk in the park
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day
I've got someone waiting for me
And when I see her I know that she'll say
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day

Hi! Hi! Hi, beautiful Sunday
This is my, my, my, beautiful day
When you say, say, say, say that you love me
Oh my, my, my, it's a beautiful day

Birds are singing, you by my side
Lets take a car and go for a ride
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day
We'll drive on and follow the sun
Making Sunday go on and on
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day

Hi! Hi! Hi, beautiful Sunday
This is my, my, my, beautiful day
When you say, say, say, say that you love me
Oh my, my, my, it's a beautiful day

Hi! Hi! Hi, beautiful Sunday
This is my, my, my, beautiful day
When you say, say, say, say that you love me
Oh my, my, my, it's a beautiful day
Hi! Hi! Hi, beautiful Sunday
This is my, my, my, beautiful day
When you say, say, say, say that you love me
Oh my, my, my, it's a beautiful day
