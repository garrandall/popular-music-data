Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you
Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to,
Judy and Johnny just walked thru the door
But like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
