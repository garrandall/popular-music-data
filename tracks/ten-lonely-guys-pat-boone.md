Each night we meet and talk about you
Reminisce about the things you used to do
We just sit around broken-hearted
'Cause all of us are still in love with you


Oh, yes we're ten lonely guys with ten broken hearts
We thought your lies were true
Yes, we're just ten lonely guys with tears in our eyes
Ten lonely guys who still love you

Eddie was the first one to hold you
Jerry was the first to taste your kiss
Then came Johnny, Stan, Richie, Neal, and Bobby, Jack, and Cliff
And I was the last one on your list


The footsteps at the door can mean just one thing
Someone else has been a fool for you
One more guy who wants to tell his story
One more guy who knows what we've been through

Oh, yes we're ten lonely guys with ten broken hearts
We thought your lies were true
Yes, we're just ten lonely guys with tears in our eyes
And tonight we'll set a chair for someone new
