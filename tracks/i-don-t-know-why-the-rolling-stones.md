Aye, Hey
She from the hood but she got me so gone
Know what I'm talking about, real hood hoe, for real
Aye, yeah

She from the hood but she got me so gone (Hey)
And Iâm just tryna see what type of shit you on (Hey)
Honestly what type of shit you on? (Hey)
She got me so gone (Woah, woah)
Got me callin' like three in the morn
She from the hood, but she got me so gone (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on, alive, from the dark to the sun (Oh)

My whole fam think sheâs a gold digger, hey
But they dont know she just love what she gettin', hey
Skinny nigga, so my ice on my bones, hey
I'm still promoting, go listen to pick up the phone, hey
Missing every red, that's a bad call, bet nigga
Say you won't, eyes on the fed, takin' bars 'til I dead walk
Wasps on my leg, big feet on my asphalt
Take a gram of molly, this shit look like some bath salt
Yeah nigga, mask off, I take off in the cash top
All I see is stars in my cars in my back walk
Chokin' while you talkinâ nigga, mom gonâ forget ya
Upset stomach diarrhea gon' shit on her
Five, four, three two one this dick wonât forget ya
Huh, hopped out the Rolls with some chains like slave, uh
Knock it out the park like a motherfuckin' bat
Hopped in the benz,  in the day
550, he don't know what to say
Headlining all my shows, done today
Hoe, you just gotta Rolls why you late?
Hey, hey, hey

She from the hood but she got me so gone
And I'm just tryna see what type of shit you on
Honestly what type of shit you on? (Woah, woah)
She got me so gone
Got me callinâ like three in the morn
She from the hood, but she got me so gone
I'm on, alive, from the dark to the sun


Yeah, big weed, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Smokin' O's
It's paid for, it's not a loaner (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, Goddamn)
Yeah, I'm lookin' at her like I want her (like I want her)
Yeah, I got her, she a goner (she a goner)
I'm in love with Mary Jane and everybody want her
And you can catch her in the hood where everybody call her
Ay, big weed, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
Smokin' O's (O's)
It's paid for, it's not a loaner (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
Yeah, I'm lookin' at her like I want her (like I want her)
Yeah, I got her, she a goner (she a goner)
I'm in love with Mary Jane and everybody want her
And you can catch her in the hood where everybody call her

I need gas back, fill up three trash bags
Roll a hundred woods, fingers hurt pass the gas mask
Yeah, I hope this batch way better than the last batch
Yeah, smoke an OG Louie and Sherbinski
Hey, I need to build me a private dispensary
He don't smoke so then you cannot be friends with me
Train smoker only backwoods, hundred blunts a day
First time shoppin' out in Cali, had my brother Tay
We were just movin' too quick, them niggas wasn't straight
Nigga we ain't lookin' for a front, we just tryna pay
Young niggas been had it in this, couldn't get the way
Now my shows bringin' 55 to 100k
Mill in a month, now that's a game that I like to play
I did it for a year and I was up, couldn't believe my fate
Then I said I'd go to hundred M's and have a nigga straight
1200 block Harlem world, known for juggin' hard
Had my first pack before I flipped and went and showed my mom
I couldn't hide it, I'm the Zoo, I swear it felt flawed
And I was great as something that I loved to do
We wasn't worried about 12, fuck the train too

Yeah, big weed, I'm a stoner (Yeah)
Smokin' O's
It's paid for, it's not a loaner (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
Yeah, I'm lookin' at her like I want her (like I want her)
Yeah, I got her, she a goner
And I'm in love with Mary Jane and everybody want her
And you can catch her in the hood where everybody call her
Yeah, big weed, I'm a stoner
Smokin' O's
It's paid for, it's not a loaner (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
Yeah, I'm lookin' at her like I want her
Huh, I got her, she a goner
I'm in love with Mary Jane and everybody want her (Yeah)
And you can catch her in the hood where everybody call her (Goddamn)

Yeah, king slime (king slime)
Zooville (Aye what up slime?)
2016 shit (2016 shit)
Aye, yeah baby, aye (Oh baby)
Yeah, aye (Oh baby)
Yeah, aye (Yeah baby)
Yeah, aye (Yeah baby)
Ooh, aye, aye (Yeah baby)
Mmm, Ooh, aye...
Slatt!
