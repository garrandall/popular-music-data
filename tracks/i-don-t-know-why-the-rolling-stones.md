I don't know why I love you, babe
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you, baby
But I love you darling, yes I do


You always treat me like a fool
You kick me when I'm down, that's you're rule
I don't know why I love you, baby
But I love you


When are you going to stop your cheating ways
With another guy you laugh in my face
Just how long must I be in this, disgraced
Because I love you, baby


I don't know, I don't know why, babe
I don't know, I don't know why, baby
I don't know why I love you, baby
But I love you




I don't know, I don't know why, babe
I don't know, I don't know why, baby
I don't know why I love you
