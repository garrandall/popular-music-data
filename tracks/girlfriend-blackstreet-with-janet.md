Blackstreet, JJ
Come on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, what what


What's up girlfriend?
What's up boyfriend?
Yo, meet my girlfriend
Meet my boyfriend
This is my girlfriend
This is my boyfriend
So what's up girlfriend?
So what's up boyfriend?
Yeah you know, uh huh, what's up?


I can't get her off my back
Gave her a little love, she don't know how to act
She be gettin' mad cuz I don't love her back
I didn't know honey gets down like that
Now fella gotta watch his back
This female is a fatal attract'
Maybe cuz she got zipper to jack
She didn't know I puts it down like that, that's why

1	Girlfriend on the phone
	Call me all day on the telephone
	Blowin' up my beeper 'cause she ready to bone
	Played me once, won't leave me alone

She keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that she lovin' me
But my girlfriend said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Uh, pick it up JJ one time


I can't get him out of my hair
Had the boy playin' truth or dare
Callin' my phone at to where I be
Boy said, sweetie you're my main squeeze
It's 2 AM and he's back again
Arms on his waist, all in my way
Plottin' ways to get in my mix
Boy, already there's a little spice in this

2- 	Boyfriend on the phone
	You call me all day on the telephone
	Blowin' up my pager cuz he ready to bone
	Played me once, won't leave me alone

He keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that he's lovin' me
But my baby said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it


Uh, uh, yeah, turn the lights off, it's about to get plenty dark
You wasn't smart, you started fuckin' Ja with your heart
If I ripped it apart don't hate me, thank me baby
If my world was yours it would drive you crazy
Cuz I love what I do, like fuckin' you hoes and soon
Talk to your tears until you feel there's something to prove
And with nothing to lose I can see you being a tease
You fuckin' with me, just know we fuckin' for free


Yeah I know that you was lost, first bite had you tossed
E-V-E, caramel skin bitch cost
And before you stroke the kitty nigga better break off
Nigga wanna fuckin' run, better shake off
Show me something, diamonds and the furs ain't nothin'
Impress me, bless me with a Hummer, think I'm frontin'?
Big cat with the big gat ready to fuck
One nut you done screamin' damn baby I'm stuck


Why in the world would you continue to run my way?
Got hit once, found out that I don't play
What the deal mami?
Who pushed you through the irony of
Fuckin' and suckin' me, splitin' the coke with me


Yeah you use to have me flippin'
All your ex-hoes had me bitchin'
Daddy, I never front, your dick game keep me twitchin' (no doubt)
How can you deny this freak?
Shhh, no need to speak, just meet me on Blackstreet

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Everybody now


Boy/Girlfriend on the phone
Call me all day on the telephone
Blowin' up my pager 'cause s/he ready to bone
Played me once, won't leave me alone

S/he keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that he lovin' me
But my baby/girlfriend said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it


We out, we out
