Blackstreet, JJ
Come on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, what what


What's up girlfriend?
What's up boyfriend?
Yo meet my girlfriend
Meet my boyfriend
This is my girlfriend
This is my boyfriend
So what's up girlfriend?
So what's up boyfriend?
Yeah you know, uh huh, what's up?


I can't get her off my back
Give her a little love she don't know how to act
She be gettin' mad 'cause I don't want her back
I didn't know honey gets down like that
Now girl I gotta watch us pack
This female is a fatal attract
Maybe 'cause she got zipper to jack
She didn't know I puts it down like that
that's why...


 - Girlfriend on the phone
Call me all day on the telephone
Blowin' up my beeper 'cause she ready to bone
Played me once, won't leave me alone

She keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that she lovin' me
But my girlfriend said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it

Uh, pick it up JJ one time


I can't get him out of my hair
Had the boy playin' truth or dare
Callin' my phone this is where I be
Boy said, sweetie you're my main squeeze
It's 2am and he's back again
Arms on my waist, all in my way
Boy there must be more spice than this


 - Boyfriend on the phone
Call me all day on the telephone
Blowin' up my beeper 'cause he ready to bone
Played me once, won't leave me alone

He keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that he's lovin' me
But my baby said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it


Yeah, turn the lights off, it's about to get plenty dark
You wasn't smart, you started fuckin' Ja with your heart
If I ripped it apart don't hate me, thank me baby
If my world was yours it would drive you crazy
'Cause I love what I do, like fuckin' you hoes and soon
Talk to your tears until you feel there's something to prove
And with nothing to lose I can see you being a tease
You fuckin' with me, just know we fuckin' for free


Yeah I know that you was lost, first bite had you tossed
E-V-E, caramel skin bitch cost
And before you stroke the kitty nigga better break off
Nigga wanna fuckin' run, better shake off
Show me something, diamonds and the furs ain't nothin'
Impress me, bless me with a Hummer, think I'm frontin'?
Big cat with the big gat ready to fuck
One nutt you done screamin' "damn baby I'm stuck!"


Why in the world would you continue to run my way?
Got hit once, found out that I don't play
What the deal mami?
Who pushed you through the irony of Fuckin'
and suckin' me, splitin' the coke with me


Yeah you used to have me flippin'
All your ex-hoes had me bitchin'
Daddy, I never front, your dick game keep me twitchin'
(no doubt) How can you deny this freak?
Shhh...no need to speak, just meet me on Blackstreet








She/he keep paging me, calling me, stalking me, hawkin' me
Followin' me, telling me that s/he lovin' me
But my baby/girlfriend said, just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it
Just handle it
I can't handle it


We out
