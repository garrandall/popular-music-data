Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
Ain't no reason that I'll ever be untrue
There's no need for me to try
I can't find the reason why
Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do


I was always the one
Who needed some affection
And you opened your heart to me
Now I'm falling in love
And I can't get enough of your love
There ain't no...


Ain't nobody who can love me like you do (nobody)
Ain't no reason that I'll ever be untrue (never be untrue)
There's no need for me to try
I can't find the reason why
Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do


Since you've been in my life
Now I have direction
And I know where I want to be
Boy, you know it's with you
'Cause I love what you do
When you're making sweet love to me


I thought that I was wrong
For wanting to be with you all the time
I never knew
That you would play games with my mind, yeah yeah


Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
Ain't no reason that I'll ever be untrue
(I won't ever be untrue)
There's no need for me to try
I can't find the reason why
Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do


When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
When you hold me in your arms
I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you, boy
'Cause you give me your good love
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
