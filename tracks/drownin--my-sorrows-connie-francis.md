I'll be drowning my sorrows over you

I was happy when you were my true love
Now I find that I'm losing my mind
'Cause they told me that you found a new love
Now I know that the fates are unkind

That's why I'm drowning my sorrows
Facing lonely tomorrows
Drowning my sorrows
In an ocean of tears

My broken heart keeps recalling
As my teardrops keep falling
That I'm drowning my sorrows over you

Now I know that my bridges are burning
'Cause there'll never be no one else for me
So I pray, darling, soon you'll be returning
And you'll break these chains of love and set me free

Till then I'm drowning my sorrows
Facing lonely tomorrows
Drowning my sorrows
In an ocean of tears

My broken heart keeps recalling
As my teardrops keep falling
That I'm drowning my sorrows over you
Yes, I'm drowning my sorrows over you
