Ya-Da-da-da-da-dat, dat-dat-dat-dat
Ya-Da-da-da-da-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat

Well it's down in California where the orange trees grow
Oh California
And there's a pretty little girl that he used to know
Oh California

Well he called me everyday about a quarter to one
Oh California
She said Come on over daddy lets have some fun
Oh California

He said, I heard about your husband is he back from the gym?
She said, Come on over daddy don't you worry bout him
Not me, no not me - I ain't no boxer
A not me, a no not me

Now he's down in Alabama where they say you were
Oh Alabama
Where they dance all around until they have a ball
Oh Alabama
Where we saw down in the village they were gathered around
Oh Alabama
And then they looked at him, they called him Cat the Clown
Oh Alabama

He said Now wait a minute Buster, you didn't call me right
They said What you're tryin' to do, boy is start a little fight?
Not me Not me, no not me
I ain't no boxer

Not me, no not me, not me, no not me

Well now he's back in Virginia back in his home town
Oh Virginia
A where he's got a reputation from a miles around
Oh Virginia
Yeah, and never no more will he ever roam
Oh Virginia
You know he's stickin' right there a to his happy home
Oh Virginia

Oh well a fella walked up to him he said lets make a trip
He said You better shut-up before I bust you in your lip
Not me, not me, no not me

He ain't got to go nowhere!
Uh-huh, not my baby!
You know you been hurt out there on that road!
Yep, keep it comin'!
