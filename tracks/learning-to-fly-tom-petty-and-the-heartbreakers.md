Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings 
Coming down is the hardest thing

Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)
Coming down (Learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)

Well, some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

I'm learning to fly around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
Around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
(Learning to fly, learning to fly)
