From the C-O to across the seas
I'm guaranteed to everybody bounce w/ me
Been known to put it down anyplace I be
You can copy but it's only gon' be one me
I don't ride in no cars till a man come wit me
14 and i started up a whole epidemic
Look, ya'll know what I'm talkin about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups sayin, "We go w/ each other."
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mil out the gate?
I'm the hottest thang around
Neck full of bling, bling like the neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front & rear
When I step up in the spot this is all I hear

I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

Right now, when I'm old, where I'm gonna be
How I flow, homie you can bet the house on me
I'ma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different Strokes
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time
Like the number 2-3 in the red and black
Mr. 106 & Park is back...HOLLA!
I do it like no other
And attract mo' family than Ringling Brothers
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns
See I'm the best just ask around
I'm here now, and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You betta off gettin' a shirt, makin' a sign that reads
"Shad Moss, I'm yo number 1 fan!"

I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
