Turn it inside out so I can see
The part of you that's driftin' over me
And when I wake you're, you're never there
And when I sleep you're, you're everywhere
You're everywhere


Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there


'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone


I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me


'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Oh, whoa, whoa


And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
There never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so


'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone


'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath, it's you I breathe
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone


You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?
