Paper bags and plastic hearts
All are belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Lets get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right


Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight


Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive


Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight


All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind me
Answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight


Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway


Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight
