Sun arise, she bring in the morning
Sun arise, bring in the morning, fluttering the skirts all around
Sun arise, she come with the dawning
Sun arise, come with the dawning, spreading all the light all around

Sun arise, on the kangaroo paw
Sun arise, on the kangaroo paw, glistening the dew all around

Sun arise, filling all the hollows
Sun arise, filling all the hollows, lighting up the hills all around

Sun arise, come with the dawning
Sun arise, she come every day
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Sun arise, every, every, every, every, day
She drive away the darkness, every day
Drive away the darkness
Bringing back the warmth to the ground

Sun arise, oh, oh
Sun arise, oh, oh
Spreading all the light all around

Sun arise, bring in the morning
Sun arise, bring in the morning, spreading all the light all around
