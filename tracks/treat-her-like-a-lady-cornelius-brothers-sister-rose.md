All my friends had to ask me
Something they didn't understand
How I get all the women
In the palms of my hand

And I told them
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady and she'll give in to you
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

I know you've heard that a woman (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
Will soon take advantage of you (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
Let me tell you, my friend (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
There just ain't no substitute (treat her like, you got to treat her like)

So you ought to
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady and she'll give in to you
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

Oh, you got to love her (love her), tease her (tease her)
But most of all you got to please her (please her)
You got to hold her (hold her) and want her (want her)
And make her feel you'll always need her (need her)
You know a woman (woman) is sentimental (woman)
And so easy (woman) to upset (woman)
So make her feel (feel) that she's for real, yeah (real)
And she'll give you happiness, whoa

Strange as it seems (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
You know you can't treat a woman mean (treat her like, you got to treat her like)

So my friends, there you have it
I said it's the easy, simple way
If you fail to do this
Don't blame her if she looks my way

'Cause I'm gonna
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
So affectionately (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
I'm gonna treat her like a lady and she'll give in to me
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

Oh, you gotta
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady
