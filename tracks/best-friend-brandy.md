Whenever I'm down, I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need, so I
I'm calling you now, just to make it through
What else can I do, don't you hear my pleas?
Friends may come, and friends may go

But you should know that
I've got your back, it's automatic
So never hesitate to call
Cause I'm your sister and always for ya, and I

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend

Whenever I'm down
With all that's going on, it's really going on
Just one of those days
You say the right thing to keep me moving
To keep me going strong; what else can I say?

Friends are there through thick and thin
Well, I've been told that
And I believe that it's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
Cause I'm your sister and always for ya, and I don't know

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend

I'll be there for you
When you're going through
Wouldn't you be my friend?
Friend, you can count on me
Call me when you need me

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend
