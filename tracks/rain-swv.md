Large up Kid D
This is the "Rain" remix
Featuring Max Valentine
The lovely lady A.L
And hang tight my nigga Money Bagz
Aight, let's get 'em
It's Momentum 2
Ladies crew, it's your time


Yeah, uh, I make her hair stand up when I'm loving her
Butterflies fill her stomach, I ain't even fucking her
Looking to arouse and get lost
Kicking off the covers, yeah, under them sheets, it gets hot
I'm feeling her a lot, had to let my feelings show
Ex, did her bad, had to let her feelings go
Casual up in Gauchos, jeans and the flights on
Looking at your backside, looking like it's something I could
Write on, cocktails, taste this
Now she think I'm flirting with the waitress, baby, don't go there
Drinks on tap, yeah, we got a flow here
Feelings grow quickly, another two drinks
And I'm tipsy, talking over steak
You could say I'm giving her my history, baby, she the baddest
Lent over, kissed me, fuck the table manners
She said I'm the artist, but she paint the canvas


Let it rain on me
Ooh, rain down on me, yeah, yeah
Let it rain on me
Just, just
Let it rain on me
Let it rain
Let it rain on me


Rain down on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me
Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me


Her father used to scare the life out of me
But still I couldn't keep my distance
Stereotype
But she knew that I'd beat the system
I'm on the road and she in deep revision
But somehow she could still see my vision
All while she's studying to be a pedatrician
She was too good for me (I was too hood for her)
Any time my mum see us together (she would look concerned)
I told her there's another side to me (I even took her church)
All them other niggas, they just wanna hear the pussy purr
What they know about a spiritual connection?
Your spirit and my spirit connecting
Soul mates, cold gates, smiling for the whole day
This role-play remind me of the old days, I know you remember
You would always calm me down when I would lose my temper
Cupid aimed at my chest and shot me through the centre
Fragments from the love slug hit my heart and made my blood run
I shot that pussy back, now it's 1-1


Let it rain on me
Let it rain on me, baby
On me
Just, just
Let it rain on me
Let it rain
Let it rain on me


Rain down on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me
Rain down on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me


It's funny, whoever thought she'd be my dame?
We started off so different, now we move the same
They say karma's a bitch, well, I'm just kicking back
Waiting for the same bitch to call my name
Yeah, she's saying "make it rain"
So I make it pour, reminiscing on the days
Me and her were poor, now we're made
Open expensive doors, take her to a place
Broke niggas can't afford, short trips for a couple nights
Luxury hotels, three bills a night
I'm with my mistress, Money Bagz, her Mr Right
She loves when I spend a night living this double life
X5, private plate, are you silly?
Roley on my wrist, but still I'm just a humble guy
And I don't hustle like I'm alright
I hustle like I'm fucking broke, all the fucking time


Let it rain on me
Rain
Let it rain on me
Just, just
Let your love shower me, baby, please
Let it rain
Let it rain on me


Rain down on me
Chill me with your loving touch
Rain down on me
Me
