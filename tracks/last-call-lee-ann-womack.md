I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer


I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in a bar
Cause I'm always your last call


I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
"Baby, I still love you"
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling...


I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last


Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call


I bet you're in a bar
It's always the same old song
That Johnny Walker Red
By now it's almost gone
But baby, I won't be there
To catch you when you fall
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last call
