It's like jumpin
It's like leapin
It's like walkin on the ceilin
It's like floatin
It's like flyin through the air
It's like soarin                         
It's like glidin                         
It's a rocket ship you're ridin
It's a feelin that can take you anywhere

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin                                                   
Why they call it fallin                         
I don't know

There was passion
There was laughter
The first mornin after                         
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground
Every time we were together                         
We talked about forever                         
I was certain it was Heaven we had found                         

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin                                                   
Why they call it fallin                         
I don't know

But you can't live your life                         
Walkin in the clouds                         
Sooner or later                         
You have to come down                         

It's like a knife
Through the heart                         
When it all comes apart                         
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon
It's a hole                         
It's a cave                         
It's kinda like a grave                         
When he tells you that he's found somebody new                         

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin                                                   
Why they call it fallin                         
Now I know

Ooh, why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin                        
Now I know
