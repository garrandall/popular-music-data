Time alone will tell
My love for you will never end
Although I know, that you must go
Fate that let us meet
Was indiscrete to let me fall in love with you

Time may change the world
But I could never change the world we used to know
I love you so!
Time alone will tell
For no one else could be as wonderful as you

I'll go on, so lonely now
But losers must go on some how!
Time alone will tell
You'll always be my one and only love

Non pensare a me
(non pensare a me - backup singers)
La vita continuerà, il mondo non si fermerà!

Time alone will tell
You'll always be my one and only love!
(repeat 2x)
