Oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, I'm hooked, uh huh
Right into your love, uh huh
Are you ready for mine
Are you ready, are you ready

Look what I got
Good loving so hot
Come on, let me show you

Ooh, there are no words that
Can express the way I feel now
And I want you to know

I need you in my life, ooh, baby
I need you, baby, I really do
My love is true
I need you in my life
In my life, baby, you know

Baby, I'm hooked, uh huh
Right into your love, uh huh

Are you ready, are you ready

Look what I got (come here, baby)
Good loving so hot (give me love)

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, I'm hooked (I'm hooked)
Right into your love

Can express the way I feel now

In my life (in my life)
