When you said it was over you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Oh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart


Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back, whoa.
Looking at my phone like she finna call back, whoa.
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now she would've sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
'Cause girls only say "Hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know the highs, the lows
It comes and goes; you say, "Be real." I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring. Funny, right?
And I never cheated. I mean, maybe once, twice.
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying




Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call
Miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ill, ewww
Time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama calling me "daddy". Got me.
I drank too much, please call me a "cabby". Swerve
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy. Swerve
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin' 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga I don't even have you
How am I supposed to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worryin' about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
Schh, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
Schh, but players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed


When you said it was over you shot right through my heart
Tunechi
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Oh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start
Damn
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart


...Baby
Last time calling me "baby"
Last time calling me "crazy", "crazy", "crazy"
