Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them be
So let me be, and I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, gonna get you back

Say your faith is shaken, you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting here, don't care where I have to go

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, gonna get you back
