Came in early, all gassed up for the drop
Like how could I drop on a beat like that
That's dank if I ever saw dank in my life, that's dank
Like 3.5 of the Am, ah fam I ain't hacking the way he just came in
Just came in the game all brazen
These man are pussy like pay men
I'll roll on a pussy like pussy, where's payment?
No understatement, rah are you paying for the pussy?
Paying for the puss with your wages, wussy
If I make this hoody go wushy it's suttin like ssss, nah get shushy
See I gave him this old school nuggy and made him cry
Ca' I'm too pushy I gave him this bald patch, ca' I'm too big now
Too big now so you can't push me
Changed my name to Resident, why?
More citizens cold, start head locking (censored)
With the gang that's far ruckus
About calm down you ain't got pouch muppet
Just lie with your mandem, probably cause a crowd cover
You won't house nothing
Hype nothings about hype cousins
Doubt brothers will come round bussing
Peep these G's on the back road, suttin' like footpaths
Suttin' like low key, the way a man pick this green like am buds
Suttin' like Brockley, suttin' like bogie
The way I see these man throw their hands up
Like raising arms for the police
Suttin' like kung-fu chop to their arm pits
Suttin' quite forceful nottin' like OB
Suttin' like how can a man try diss man?
How can a man try snake man?
How can a man try risk that?
How can he wear that wrist watch and try talk like a big man?
And tell a man piss off!
But I won't make man miss that
But I won't set this ting off
But I don't know about riff raff
But I don't know about big bags
About Wisdom ain't a big boss
Charge next man ten pound for tic-tac
But I don't know about big bucks
Fat like Rick Ross
But I don't know 'bout chin man
Bust that sling shot
Risk your life when the ting pops
Huh, I ain't seen man
Mans vile when the spliff stops
Run wild and I win lots
Come trial with the big dog
They ain't shelling nothing if I've been on
Simply, simply she want the D ca' I'm dimply
Thinking I'm old and I'm wrinkly
Couldn't chat to the Wis on diss
I'm on a don when I work on a symphony
Come with your one line flow like
Man couldn't write the flow when I was stuck in assembly
Mans beating the base 'til it's timbery
Tambourine rappers ain't touching my energy
Cause I'm worldwide
I don't know nothing about no likes
In fact I don't know nothing about ghost writes
But I know a little suttin' 'bout wrote mine
Oh my, they're so Myan
They're predicting shit but they're so lying
Looking at man like I'm no Simon
Like their bossing me I get so Simon
Get so violent start close lining
O in ear like I'm blow drying
Got hoes on the pole, I ain't no fireman
Got bare on the pole like cold climates
My they're so admiring, like the O roles through like a known giant
Looking at man like I'm no Simon
Like their bossing me I get so Simon
It's tragic, I swear man is embarrassed
Like how the fuck did they manage?
Like how the fuck did they cope?
If that was me I swear I wouldn't have it
Mans got all the flows that you got
But you can't hack the flows that mans chatting
Hancock called and said, ''You know what, that's too much might to match when O's rapping''
So what do you reckon? That you'll be willing, now you'll be probably following second
Cause everybody in my city got a hobby for heckling
'Til I roll up and they realise a prodigy stepping in
And then they shush, quite big now I might throw you in a bush
Quite big now ya can't tell me about push
Might push, push, push, 'til I can't push
Can't tell me about
Old school like actual soccer
Catch a couple mandem claiming that they're casually blotting
I have to roll up on them, tell them would you pack it and stop it
I heard a couple man that want it, but regretting the shotting
And everybody love it when I tell them biggidy bobbady
Yeah they love it when the Wizzy tell em biggidy bobbady
Couple man that chatted to me, shitter philosophy
I ain't really tryna hear it, I ain't listening properly

Deadly, how the flow deadly
How you flow like that, over them medley
All the don dadda, all the don dadda
Pointing in mirrors, hope that you get me
Man got that armour so they know I sentry
Still they got sentry, sent to come get me
Sent to defend them but it don't tempt me
Ca' I'm so dangerous and the flow deadly
You get me, I'm deadly
You people are gonna respect me
Don't bill me, I'm not Wesley
I got bills now, I'm on the bill now
Got bookings, looking all hefty
But I see brudda, my dad in me talking 'bout how the music industry stress me
Man wanna talk about Ocean touching the mainstream like I'm an estuary
See I ain't got tekkers like him, or tekkers like her or tekkers like Heskey
Me I stay doing my ting to the tone of my skin, looking blacker than Pepsi
And all of the man at my show got a smile on their face cause the gal looking sexy
Like she got a double barrelled name, she'll get the double barrel in her belly
That's Rick Ross, living big belly, hitting day regularly jelly
Sometimes when your mind flies and you're left behind it gets scary
Ca' you're left flipping them burgers while they're on earners spitting on tele
Now man wanna chat about work rate but it's too late for that ca' they weren't ready
Now we say we're not sorry and when fiends chase we're not worried
Ca' when the beat shakes in my body, they can't try replace me or copy
When the beat shakes in your body, that's just you getting beat by geezer
Nuff man wanna chat about knees up that's why they can't get their p's up
Ease up, with the waving
Do you see your young self waving, goodbye to the man you became ca' you lost your way when you went out raving
No? Are you sure though?
Hang on bro, look more dough
Ca' I see the boy in you, that's why I'm boying you
You ain't the boss on your but I might move three plates with my donny's
I don't do freebasing or molly
I'm finna roundhouse kick the taxman, he's taking too much percent from me
Feeling like Jon Jones in this bitch, still I might box man I don't sniff
See the way I'm calling out for these G's, G's, G's all now I'm like Chris
Did you bank on this kid, chasing dreams, spitting like this?
Soon as I got that direct message from Charlie I started getting angry at Chip
Then I thought wait let me digest
Better not retch, do it like Wretch
Then I thought wait, do it like Ghetts
Ca' I switch flows and I go next
Suttin' like, suttin' like in a sec how the spit intersect with the sound of the song you select on a deck
In effect a re-vet in a mess ca' I'm blessed with the pen and I'm blessed on a set
Got the S on my chest so the best of the best get left with the rest that's stressed
Invest in a vest and a vocal, the cheque that you got it ain't got long legs
If you got a strong chest then you might not cough when I t'ump your head
You ain't using that it's collecting dust, you should unplug it before bed
Go to sleep and don't wake up so we can save us what's left
Ca' any moment them geeky neeks are gonna take us out but I ain't stressed
Take us out but I inspect from miles away it's all part of the test
Like I try do my show and them feds try put man under arrest
Swear mans got a vibrant soul 'til they find my chrome, wan' give man stress
Mans going down a quite hype road tryna hide my goal, tryna hide my flesh
From cautions to sentences, their raucous they're not tentative
Let me sip my tea and just smoke my plant from the ground as the lord intended it
And man wanna chat about big man boss man but they don't pay no rent 'til it
See I don't really know about that I just show a man tracks and they don't wanna censor it
Can I get a little 'Are you mad, are you dumb? ' that's a bar
Can I get a little pond in the back of the yard with a bar in the garden for laughs
Can I get a little fifteen bags for a show, I'm on two so I'm on the right path
Can I take a likkle time out now and then if I put too much stress on the art
Ca' you know these days it's not funny, that's why these sprays are not lully
Still when the beat shakes in my body, they can't try replace me or copy
When the beat shakes in your body, that's just you getting beat by broski
Nuff man wanna sell a man O Z's cause they know I get that show P, owe me
No apology, if you leave me alone don't bother me
I mean really I know my qualities, In all honesty I am not one of these little barrers
That you wanna go against rudeboy, I ain't nottin' to fly against rudeboy
You ain't running in no events rudeboy, you're one of them no events rudeboy

Few man said when I blew and I weren't on a hype no more that I went soft, I went greazier
Running through tings since double 0-9 but I can't lie fam it's got easier
Now I get Lem that's sweet, get Am that's dank, get Cheese that's cheesier
Now I draw Vogue-ing models and tings and 2-2 tings that's moving sleazier
Man wanna send for the Wis like I wouldn't just headlock man like an eediot
And dem man never made money off rap now they're pissed off ca' they can't be dat
See I saw them man tryna form their plan but it didn't work now they wanna pree man
Like hold on, how you mean fam, you seen the work rate so don't beef man
You likkle hobbyist, real talk that's what it is
Rap don't pay rent for the novices
Now they pissed off ca' they can't stop the Wis
And it don't matter no more, how many mandem man tell 'bout how wack Wissy is
Ca' I got fans and I'm already killing it but they ain't got fans, no body listening, no body listening
I said no body listening, me I got the ting on my wrist and it's glistening
You ain't got P's in the bank so you're fidgeting
Me I got a thou' in the crowd when I spit a ting
See the legends and the OG's, they respect man, ca' they know me
You got no job and your whole team is just two faced about broski
Got that debut body of work and it charted, trust me it cost ten pounds
Whilst them man are doing free mixtapes, free albums for the past five years, what now?
What's the top five to a few wanna-be MC's who can't get their sound off the ground
Dem man ain't living the dream and they pissed cause we living the movie and they lost out
Living the movie and they lost out, might flick on the crux for a grey nostalg'
Flick on the level one, whatever one is the better one, Wizzy might knock a man out
I be the better one, they be the rest and they stressing cause I be the talk of the town
If you a rapper, critic, fan, hater, you know 'bout the team by now
Nobody's saying your name, you ain't getting no hate, you ain't getting no love in your town
You just embarrass yourself tryna stagger and doubt while the Wizzy be running around
See how a friendly might turn to an enemy, see how a snakey might turn to a pal
Now more time when I'm counting that musical cheddar, I laugh at them bredders aloud
Nah that's V.I.P you're not allowed, stand in the crowd, or you could bounce
I saw your cheque, why did it bounce? I saw your chick, why did she bounce?
I saw your Mum, why ain't she proud? Cause you're fucking about getting fucked in your (censored) by a rapper that's levels above
And it's obvious that you'll shut up when I'm shutting it down
Who told them girls get a nooking, or they'll get a booking?
Who told these kids they're ghetto? They ain't never been jucking
Dem man shoulda moved like Dwayne, them man should have smelt what's cooking
Dem man shouldn't call my name, dem man shoulda know O shush them
Might do a show for a grand for a favour but they do a show for a bill and get gassed
Might have a business meet with a major, I might fly Greece get payed in cash
Dis music it takes us everywhere but they ain't flying nowhere off tracks
We might just benefit other economies what do they know about paying European tax?
What do they know about merchandising? What do they know about stats?
What do they know about ten man circle of experts? All of them got mans back
What do they know about blending genres? Breaking glass ceilings or tryna change Hip-Hop?
They don't know about fuck all so piss off they ain't got fuck all magic to switch on
They was gassing their 10k views in a year, blud we heard what they said
We might upload one tune at night, might get 10k before we go bed
Might not mention names, might not give man life that's dead
Might just pave our way but don't think we ain't heard what a mans said
He's something that you man never hear, exclusive premier
My gang done a tune with Premier, you're gang got a room in the Premier
That's why you should, when a bredder 'ere, when we gone better act like a bredder der
Ca' your talk gets back to a bredder ear, yeah we know who's talking we been aware
My man couldn't get a booking from a blind man, what's he talking 'bout status?
If we holla now man wanna kick it like Van Damme, cause of all these papers
If you're from my town and you're hating on us then you're pissed off cause you didn't make it
It's funny how all the other dons that's doing their ting can appreciate it, I appreciate it
Your net worth depreciating, I write a bar and I feed the nation
You write a bar pure procrastination, try rap a statement that's altercations
Yeah I'm hyping a bit Charlie, ignorant man they be hyping a lot
Like I give a shit, too late now it's unlikely to stop
That's swingers in the mist when I dig him in the rib, a little hit him in the middle with the street in the middle
With the face, any time I feel obliged and a brudda wanna front, never seen a brudda in it for the love where I'm from
Wife has said it right, she love the way I rhyme, love the I way I look, know 'bout what I'm on
Spread her to the side, whenever she wanna ride, she grabbing up on her thighs, she wrapping up on her thong
All you ever do is lie, whenever I hear a rhyme, I'm flicking it 'til you're silent, kicking it off the dog
None of you niggas vibe, when everybody be hyping, everybody be fighting, tryna be on the top
Yeah, I'm hyping a bit Charlie, ignorant man they be hyping a lot
Like I give a shit, too late now it's unlikely to
Casually be killing it, everybody be feeling it, everybody relate to the way that Wizzy be flowing
If I tell them I'ma do suttin, I'ma properly do it, I swear half you mandem clocked, I was gone before I was glowing
It's a fact if I release on a track I'ma Jesse Owen, they're watching the way I'm winning
Watching the way I'm flowing and they hating
Rah, them man they ain't contemplating
Cussing, hating on what, you're hating on loving
The negative energy dash in a dustbin
When I roll safe, walk past them man, turn to my brudda like... It's nothing
South coast don, let's end the discussion
I rep HF, I rep Rum Com, I say I rep my team to the end
You say scrap that, I don't wanna buck em
