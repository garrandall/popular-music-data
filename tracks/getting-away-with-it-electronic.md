I've been walking in the rain
Just to get wet on purpose
I've been forcing myself not to forget
Just to feel worse


I've been getting away with it all my life
(Getting away)


However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
I love you more than you love me


I hate that mirror
It makes me feel so worthless
I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you
I couldn't care less


I've been getting away with it all my life
(Getting away with it)
Getting away with it all my life
(Getting away)


However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
More than you love me


I thought I gave up falling in love
A long long time ago
I guess I like it but I can't tell you
You shouldn't really know
And it's been true
All my life
Yes, it's been true
All my life


I've been talking to myself
Just to suggest that I'm selfish
(Getting ahead)
I've been trying to impress
That more is less and I'm repressed
(I should do what he said)


However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me


Getting away with it
Getting away with it
