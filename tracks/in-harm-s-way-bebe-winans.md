Undying love you've given to me
Seen in me things I would never have seen
I don't understand why you care so much, it's all a mystery
Time and time again I ask myself
What have I done to deserve such wealth
The price you paid, I could never repay your generosity

In wanting to save me
In order to save the day
Because of love you placed yourself
In harm's way
It's truly beyond me
Left without a word to say
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way?
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way?
When I was down you came and lifted me
When I was bound, yes, you set me free
Things that you do makes it clear to see
It's all a master plan
Oh, no greater love that I've come to know
And when I refuse, you still love me so
With open arms you came and rescued me
And erased all the pain, yes all the pain

What kind of love would place itself
And risk your life for love's sake?
What kind of love just takes on all the blame?
It seems to be so easy
It hurts sometimes but you never let go
You will to love in spite of all you know
You know, you know
