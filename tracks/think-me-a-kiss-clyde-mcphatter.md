Think me a kiss, whoa, oh
Think me a kiss, come on
And think me a hug
Let me be your cuddle bug

When I hear my baby calling
Come here, lover, to me
I haven't got a prayer
But I'm on my way
No matter where she may be
Ooby dooby dooby

Think me a kiss, whoa, oh
Now think me a kiss, come on
And think me a hug
Let me be your cuddle bug

Sometimes when I get lonely
Dreaming for her charms
Quick as a wink I start to think
That I'm right there in her arms
Ooby dooby dooby

Think me a kiss, come on
And think me a kiss, oh
Think me a hug
Let me me your cuddle bug

A few times I have messed up
Running around in space
She was calling somebody else
And I wind up on a wild goose chase

Oh, but I keep on hearing love notes
Coming in loud and strong
I better find my baby
And get home to me
Right where I belong
Ooby dooby dooby

Think me a kiss, come on
And think me a kiss, whoa, oh
Now think me a hug
Let me me your cuddle bug

Come on and think
Whoa, oh, think me a kiss

Think me a kiss
Think me a kiss
Think me a kiss
Think me a kiss
