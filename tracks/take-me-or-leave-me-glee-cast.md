Every single day
I walk down the street
I hear people say
"Baby's so sweet"

Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me
Boys, girls
I can't help it baby

So be kind
And don't lose your mind
Just remember
That I'm your baby

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me
Take me baby or leave me

A tiger in a cage
Can never see the sun
This diva needs her stage
Baby, let's have fun!

You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes
You love the limelight too, now baby

So be mine
And don't waste my time
Cryin', "Oh Honeybear
Are you still my, my, my baby?"

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me

No way, can I be what I'm not
But hey, don't you want your girl hot?
Don't fight, don't lose your head
'Cause every night, who's in your bed?

Who, who's in your bed?
Kiss, pookie

That's it! The straw that breaks my back
I quit, unless you take it back
Women, what is it about them?
Can't live with them or without them!

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
(Who I was meant to be)
And if you give a damn
(And if you give a damn ya better)
Take me baby or leave me
(Oh take me baby, take me or leave me)
Take me baby
Or leave me

Guess I'm leaving
I'm gone!
