Here I am at another dead end
Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I wanna be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade
Ain't nothing new to me No

This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone

Now looking back I realize
How hard it is to recognize
Opportunity in disguise
That's some Calamity
So I ain't gonna cuss my luck
Every time a door slams shut
I know a window's gonna open up
Just as long as I believe

This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone

Stepping Stone.. Ohhh
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It's just a stepping
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping, stepping stone
Stepping Stone
