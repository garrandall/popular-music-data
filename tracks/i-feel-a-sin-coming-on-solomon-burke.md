She just sits there
Her eyes are on me
I shake with temptation
Just knowing what it could be

I oughta go home
You see, I've been here too long
Oh, Lord, yes, I have

I say, I (I feel a sin)
I say I feel a sin right now
I really feel a sin right now
(I feel a sin) coming on

She has smoke rings
That's her halo
How high she flies depends
On how the wine flows
Makes no difference
I know I'm doing wrong

Cause I (I feel a sin)
I tell you, I feel a sin right now
I said I feel a sin right now
(I feel a sin coming on)

I got another world
Right, right, right outside
Outside the door
I got a wife, children, a home
Who could ask for more

Fool that I am
I been here too long
Yes, I have

I say, I (I feel a sin)
Deep down inside my soul
(I feel a sin)
I said I feel a sin right now
(I feel a sin)
(I feel a sin)...
