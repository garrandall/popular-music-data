On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you,
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true 'cause
You moved to west LA, or New York or Santa Fe, or
Wherever, to get away from me

Oh, but that one night, was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as Hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y love

When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, hm the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y

On the upside of a downward spiral, my love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the 'how you been?' and get down to the 'more than friends' at last

Oh, but that one night, is still the highlight
I didn't need you, until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as Hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y love

When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, hm the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve, but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu, but I thought this can't be true, 'cause

Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y love

When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mmh the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
