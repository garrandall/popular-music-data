Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night


Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder
Feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round

With this very unpleasin'
Sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground
The calliope crashed to the ground!


But she was...
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night


Some silicone sister with a manager mister told me I got what it takes
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong, play the song with the funky break"
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Asked me if I needed a ride!


But she was...
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light


She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night

But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is


Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in it's funny bone, that's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone
Was standin' in the corner, watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messin' with his frozen zone, reminding him of romance
The calliope crashed to the ground


But she was...
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night


(Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin, the calliope crashed to the ground)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(Now Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(And some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(Some silicone sister with a manager mister told me I go what it takes)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

(She said "I'll turn you on sonny to")
Blinded by the light
("something strong")


She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
