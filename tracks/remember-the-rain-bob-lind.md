Angel that you are
You still remember summer walks
And quiet talks we had before our clouds were broken
In the heaven of your mind
Your hopeful heart has put behind
All the ugly jealous times our hearts were aching
Now that your pain has been mended
You're only seeing one side
Behind the bright easy laughter
Rivers of tears have been cried
So remember the rain
When you think of the sunshine
You've got to try and see
That's it's gone for you and me
And there is no way to bring it back again
In a sad unstable way I love you more than I can say
But it's locked in yesterday and must remain there
The gentle prisoner in the stall
Sometimes forgets the very walls
That gave her shelter in the fall have also chained her
Drink from the spring of tomorrow
Yesterday's well has gone dry
All the good times are behind us
Whenever you ask yourself why
Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
On the ocean of a smile we floated easy for awhile
But now we're drifted to the shore where beauty dies
It isn't easy to explain
I never dreamed you felt the same
And even though you're not to blame we can't continue
Don't let yourself pretend that we've got something to defend
You've got to try to face the end with all that's in you
I can't deny that I love you
But my soul can no longer be bound
Fly on the wings of your freedom
But whenever you look to the ground
Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
Try to understand that it's fallen from our hands
And just be thankful that your soul is still your own
