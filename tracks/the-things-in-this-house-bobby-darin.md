Lots of things have changed
Around here since you're gone
Lamps don't shine as bright
And the TV won't go on

The pictures on the wall
Seem to hide their face
And I can't find a smile
Around here any place

Yes, the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

Ah, the rug just don't feel the same
Beneath my feet
The song bird's not singin'
And the dog won't eat

And the lonely walls
Can only stand and stare at me
And happy can't be found
In our old dictionary

Yes, the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

Oh, just the same I hear
The things that they can't say
You can call it my imagination
That's okay

But, all I know is what I feel
Way down inside
And I can run all through these rooms
But, I can't hide

'Cause the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

I say the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

I say the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

I say the things in this house
Miss you just as much as I
The only difference is
They don't know how to cry

I say the things
