If you love me, if you love me
If you love me

If the sun should tumble from the sky
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, I won't care

If it seems that everything is lost
I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, darling, I won't care

Shall I catch a shooting star
Shall I bring it where you are
If you want me to, I will
(If you want me to, I will)

You can set me any task
I'll do anything you ask
If you'll only say you
Love me still (love me still)

When at last our life
On Earth is through
I will share eternity with you
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, darling, I won't care
Let it happen, darling, I won't care

I won't care, I won't care
