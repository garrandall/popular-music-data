We used to laugh and play
All of the live long day
Open fields and open skies
Where we'd love to stay

Gather around me, children
On my merry go round
And travel along with me
Like kids we used to be

Oh where are the sunshine days
We used to know
Planting seeds of happiness
Letting everything grow

Gather around me, children
On my merry go round
And travel along with me
Like kids we used to be

All of the fun and games we played
Dreams and plans we made
Oh where did they go

Gather around me, children
On my merry go round
And travel along with me
Like kids we used to be

Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
