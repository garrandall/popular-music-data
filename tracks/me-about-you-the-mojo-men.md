Perhaps another time or maybe another place
Could  have eased my mind
Would  have never seen your face or heard about you

But now you call my name and you're reality
It's hard to explain
I  know I'll never be without you

I  know nothing about you
But I know I don't doubt your love
And  I know that it's real
By God up above I know how I feel about you

Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of rings
But a heart full of love and I know what means
To  be without you

Come sit by my side and share with me
All the feelings inside and the things you see
About me

I've always known you'd be here today
Waiting for me now the time is right
So you'll hear me say
That for all my life I will always stay about you

Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of rings
But a heart full of love and I know what means
To be without you

Come sit by my side and share with me
All the feelings inside and the things you see
About me

Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of rings
But a heart full of love and I know what means
To be without you

Come sit by my side and share with me
All the feelings inside and the things you see
About me
