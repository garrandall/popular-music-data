Girls have it made
Girls have more fun
Girls have their way
To get lovers anytime they want
Anytime she needs some lovin'
Anytime she just gives a sign
It won't take her long to find a man to oblige

Guys got to plot
Guys got to plan
Guys got to lie, cheat, steal
Do anything he can
Anything to get her to love him
Anything to make her agree
That's the way it's been since Adam and Eve

Girls can get it anytime they want
Girls can get it where a man often won't
Everybody's always after some lovin' now and then
A woman gets it faster than any man can

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

We all look for love
Somewhere, sometime
Girls find it first
They find it morning, noon and night
And it's a wonder of nature, eighth wonder of the world
That a man's got to chase her if he's gonna get the girl

Oh, when a woman wants love
A woman gets love
And it's for sure she's gonna find it
Before the sun comes up

Girls can get it, they pick and choose
Girls can get it, men are always in the mood
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
Oh, you know she'll find it easy
You know that she can
It's like givin' a little water to a thirsty man

Girls can get it anytime they want
Girls can get it where a man often won't
