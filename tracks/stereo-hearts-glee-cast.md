My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote
Make me your radio ( yeah)
Turn me up when you feel low ( turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you ( right there)
Just sing along to my stereo


Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve ( Oh
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else,
If I ask you to scratch my back, Uh)
Like it read well, check it Trouty, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize Uh)
Its just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, Oh yeah)
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts


If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand

Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you ( Oh, whoa)


My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote ( Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo


Oh oh oh oh


To my stereo


Oh oh oh oh


So sing along to my stereo


Let's go!

If I was an old school, hooh)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my yeah yeah yeah)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop ( yeah)

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me ( hey)
When you have to purchase oh)
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make

You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hands


Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you ( Oh)


My heart's a stereo ( uh)
It beats for you, so listen close ( listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote ( oh oh)

Turn me up when you feel low ( turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo ( the good life)


Oh oh oh oh ( yeah haha)


To my stereo


Oh oh oh oh


So sing along to my stereo


I only pray you never leave me behind ( never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find ( oh)
I take your head and ( yeah, yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind!


My heart's a stereo ( yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note ( you gotta make me a radio)
