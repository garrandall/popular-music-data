When there's a shadow,
you reach for the sun.
When there is love,
then you look for the one.
And for the promises, there is this land.
And for the heavens are
those who can fly.


If you really want to,
you can hear me say
Only if you want to
will you find a way.
If you really want to
You can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.

When there's a journey,
you follow a star.
When there's an ocean,
you sail from afar.
And for the broken heart,
there is the sky.
And for tomorrow are those
who can fly.



Ooh go doe bay mwa.
Ooh go doe bay mwa.



Ah! Je voudrai voler
comme un oiseau d'aile
Ah! Je voudrai voler
comme un oiseau d'aile, d'aile...

Ooh go doe bay mwa.
Ooh go doe bay mwa.



If you really want to
you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.
