I'm lying here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun


I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can


Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill


I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help


I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can


Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill


I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can


Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
