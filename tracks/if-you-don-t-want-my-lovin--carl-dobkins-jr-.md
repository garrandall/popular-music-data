If you don't want my loving
Just let me know
If you don't want my loving
Just let me know

Cause it won't hurt me, baby
If I let you go

If you don't want my kisses
My arms to hold you tight
If you don't want my kisses
My arms to hold you tight

Don't worry about it, pretty
I won't cry at all tonight

If you don't me hanging
Around you anymore
If you don't me hanging
Around you anymore

Just kiss me goodbye
And show me the door

If you don't want my loving
Just let me know
If you don't want my loving
Just let me know

Cause it won't hurt me, baby
If I let you go

Don't you want my loving
