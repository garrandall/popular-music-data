Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops

Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will (Say You Will)
Say You Will (Say You WIll)
Hey, Hey (Say You Will)

My Heart Is Fine, Fine
Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops

Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will (Say You Will)
Say You Will (Say You WIll)
Hey, Hey (Say You Will)

Just Give Me Another Chance
For our Romance
Come On And Tell Me
That One Day You'll Return
Cause Everyday That You've Been Gone Away
You'll Know Why My Heart Does Nothing But Burn
(Crying)

Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops

Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will (Say You Will)
Say You Will (Say You Will)
Hey, Hey (Say You Will)
Say It Right Now Baby (Say You Will)
Come On, Come On (Say You Will)
Say It Darling Yeah! (Say You Will)

(Fade)
