Big white girl, don't let her bite your dick off 

Bass make that bitch cum

Big white girl, don't let her bite your dick off 

Yo Skrill drop it hard!

Check! 

Yo Skrill drop it hard!

Check! 

Sirah says, chillin' in Kyoto grand with my man Skrill
Chain-smoking nicotine say fuck a fast deal.
We got a white girl so we make those Skrill checks
Fuck a white girl tour, ill neck
Karate chop her grill bits
I kill
Born from the center of a storm
All the boys flappin' gums about how they're hard, bitch
I'm harder
Martyr to the swag on the corner
Beat your girl up with the drums as the bass makes that bitch cum!

Big white girl, don't let her bite your dick off 

Bass makes that bitch cum!

Big white girl, don't let her bite your dick off
