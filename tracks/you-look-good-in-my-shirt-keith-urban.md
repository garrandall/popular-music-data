When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes 
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last 
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

C'mon now
Aww that's right
Oh you look so fine

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt 

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
