(Rafe Van Hoye)

There is no need for explanation... both of us know what's goin' on
An unspoken late night invitation
To keep 'til tomorrow when you're back where you belong

But you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light
But you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right

I feel emotion in the making... kissing the lips that never lie
But I can tell someone else is waiting
To play in the fire I see burning in your eyes

But you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light
But you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right

Don't know how often I have held you
Don't really know what this means
It's so hard for me not to tell you
You've been the star of my dreams

It's foolish to think of revealing... how I've been yours for so long
There's just no future in the feeling
A taste of your love.. then tomorrow you'll be gone

But you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light
But you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right

But you're mine... tonight... somebody else's in the morning light
But you're mine... tonight.. and that's all right
