Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you
