You've been calling on me every day
Ever since my Bobby went away
You've been knocking on my front door
And I know just what you're looking for
But, even though you really look so fine
And we could have a good time

I'm gonna wait till my Bobby gets home
Wait till my baby gets home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you better leave me alone
Sure I need some lovin' and a-kissin' and a-huggin'
Gonna wait until my Bobby gets home

You wanna take me to a movie show
I gotta tell you that I just can't go
I know Bobby's gonna call tonight
I wanna tell him evey thing's all right
So, though I haven't got a thing to do
And I'm so lonely and blue

I'm gonna wait till my Bobby gets home
Wait till my baby gets home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you better leave me alone
Sure I need some lovin' and a-kissin' and a-huggin'
Gonna wait until my Bobby gets home

I'm gonna wait till my Bobby gets home
Wait till my baby gets home
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you better leave me alone
Sure I need some lovin' and a-kissin' and a-huggin'
Gonna wait until my Bobby gets home

Whuh, oh - wait until my Bobby gets home
Whuh, oh - wait until my Bobby gets home
