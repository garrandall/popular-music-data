They waitin' for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind
They never want me to shine
But I observe that
Trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets
Never will I give the curve back
Still movin' at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn't come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles
But now I'm Socrates
With philosophies
I'm in my tree house please don't bother me
And now it's lookin' like hella-smoke
Under aid they lettin' me pass the velvet rope
And it's like getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star Texas


Uh-huh I know what's on your mind
You don't think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was week I tell you I am getting strong
This time it's gonna be different than the last time
I swear I'm gonna turn from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, see I need it for the cake I go
Like Tunday for the TV and the radio
Retro 80 flow
Hood make it crazy though
Puttin' work with music made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn't write enough rhymes
They say hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin'
I'm on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses
Young Nickonine
See now tell whatcha get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange
If I said I command it like it's the Pentagon
Hatin' on even on the roof I'm upper echelon
But still forever we shine
Turn negative to positive I never decline


Uh-huh I know what's on your mind
You don't think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was week I tell you I am getting strong
This time it's gonna be different than the last time
I swear I'm gonna turn from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today
This will wash the pain away
Uh-huh
