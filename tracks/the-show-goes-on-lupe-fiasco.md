LA-SER
Yeah, yeah
Kane is in the building, nigga
Yeah


Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad?
They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats
Then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up
When times is hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up


Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys
I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy


Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


So, no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on


Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


The show goes on
The show goes on
The show goes on
The show goes on
