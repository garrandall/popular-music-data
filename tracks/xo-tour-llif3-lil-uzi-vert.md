Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health
And when I leave this earth, I'm hoping you'll find someone else
Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
I'm happy you were mine, it just sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run

And I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
You should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to, die"

Everything I said
Messin' with your head, yeah, messin' with your head, yeah
Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge, yeah, all my friends are dead

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
(Everything I said, messin' with your head)
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed (Everything I said, messin' with your head)
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head (Messin' with your head))
I'll get you up and going out of bed (Everything I said)
