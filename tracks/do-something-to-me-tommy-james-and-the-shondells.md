Wow
Talking and signifying, saying nothing
Everybody knows that's what you do
So give me a little time I'll show you something
Give me a little time I'll get to you

Huh!

Talking and signifying, no commotion
They're never going hide what's going on
Lord, I can see the sign, got the notion
But don't let the evil pride that's coming on

Yeah, talking and signifying
Talking and signifying
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Talking and hard to shine his silver dollar
Poor man is only trying to get a few
Mmm, money force you know their gonna holler
Huh
Talking and signifying, the hell to you

Talking and signifying
Talking and signifying
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mmm, talking and signifying, ain't saying nothing
Huh, everybody knows that's what you do
Yeah, yeah, give me a little time I'll show you something
Give me a little time I'll get to you
