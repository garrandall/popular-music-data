Do something to me, I've got to find love in a hurry
C'mon, do something to me, help me to ease all the worry
Do something to me, I've got to find love in a hurry
C'mon do something to me, help me to ease all the worry

Whenever you're near me, you give me a lovin' feelin'
But, baby, you keep concealin' what I want to know
What I want to know
Do something to me, I've got to find love in a hurry
C'mon, do something to me, help me to ease all the worry

It should be so easy
You got me where you want me, baby
You love me till you get me crazy, c'mon!

Do something to me, I've got to find love in a hurry
C'mon, do something to me, help me to ease all the worry
(repeat until fade out)
