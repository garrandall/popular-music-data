Here it is...


She caught me by surprise, I must say
'Cause I never have seen a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say...


Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?


Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance, at least
I'll walk away knowing, I tried my best and I'm going
I'm going on with my day
'Cause at least she heard me say...


Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?


That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
'Cause you're never gonna know where you find love
And hopefully, I'll find it in you


Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?
(Let me make your house a home, baby)

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?
