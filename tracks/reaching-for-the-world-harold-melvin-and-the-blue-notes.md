I've been a lucky fella
Been around everywhere
Never known pain or sorrow
Never had to care
Well

Got me a lovely lady
She makes it so nice to belong
Well
Makes a man's home a castle
And his life a song

Oh we fall
All I got I still need a way
To reach for things I swear I don't have today
I need to be what I'm not
All the time All the time All the time

My life has just been a masquerade
I swear a part I wish I wished I had never played
When will I learn that every dream
Can't be mine
Can't be mine

I'm reaching for the world
Swear I am baby
Reaching for the world
Yes I am I swear I am
Reaching for the world
Reaching for the world

I wake up every morning
Same as life life before well
Breakfast on my table
Paper at my front door
You see
Been a lucky fella
I've been around around everywhere
Never known pain or sorrow
Never had to care

Just what I'm looking for is so hard to find
I swear I just can't seem to find peace of mind
My life is climbing up a hill to survive
Girl I swear to
My present's just looking, looking for a good time
And from what I can see oh lord he just can't be friends of mine
One never knows just who can be real or not
Reaching for the world yes I am baby
Reaching for the world with my heart in my hand
Reaching for the world Reaching for the world

Reaching for the world

(Reaching for the world)
(Reaching for the world)
(Reaching for the world)

My present's just lookingâ€š looking for a good time
And from what I can see oh lord he just can't be friends of mine
One never knows just who can be real or not
And I am Reaching for the world swear I am baby
Reaching for the world with my heart in my hand
Reaching for Reaching for the world I swear I am baby
Reaching for the world

Reaching for the world
Reaching for the world
Reaching for the world
