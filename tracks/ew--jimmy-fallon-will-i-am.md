Seriously? Look at her butt. Ew!
Oh, she looks like a slut. Ew!
I'm like “What the what”? Ew!
Right? Right? Ew, ew!
Oh, you got to see this, ew!
Oh my gross I can't believe it, ew!
She's so basically basic, ew!
She's literally making me sick, ew!


This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously, seriously. Ew, ew!
No seriously, seriously! Ew, ew!
I can't, I can't! Ew, ew!


Look at look at this. OM-effin-G, what the eff?
You're gonna freakin' flip, like, seriously freakin' flip
'Cause Sally's mad at Iggy because Iggy's booty's more biggy
And Sally's booty's twiggy so she called her friend Cybie
Now Sally's gonna get impleggies
What's impleggies? Implants, silly, ew!
I'm freakin' for real
I think silicone butts are ew, ew!


Where’d she get that outfit? Ew
That girl is totally ratchet. Ew!
No seriously – who likes that? Ew!
Right right? Ew, ew!
Look at the way she takes pics, ew!
And what's up with those duck lips? Ew!
She's so lame, ew!
Super lame! Ew, ew!


This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
No, seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
Oh my gosh. Ew, ew!


I am not hating
I am merely conversating
With my BFF Sara!
So bust your rhyme, Sara!


It’s Mir.I.Am and you know who
Now here's some things I think are ew
FaceTime and reclining in
Airplane seats and then Vining
Retweeting tweets, I'm not lying
'Cause even rhyming's annoying!
Bread bowls and ravioli, casserole, a roly-poly
Caterpillar on my really old and moldy windowsill, ew
Trapper keepers and a creeper wearin' sneakers
With the toes and maybe Frozen 'cause you knowin'
I don't wanna build a snowman


Ew! Ew, ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew
Ew! Ew, ew! Seriously yuck!


Hello, my name is Sara, that's Sara with no "H"
Too bad if you don't like it, 'cause haters gonna hate
My Stepdad Gary, he tries to act so cool
Every time we see him, my friends and I say "Ew!"


Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?
Oh my gosh, it's my stepdad Gary
And he just ruined it!
I heard that funky beat that you was playing down here
It's a party over here, it's a party over here
Ew!
