Seriously? Look at her butt. Ew!
Oh, she looks like a slut. Ew!
I'm like "What the what"? Ew!
Right? Right? Ew, ew!

Oh, you got to see this
Oh my gross I can't believe it
She's so basically basic
She's literally making me sick

This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously, seriously. Ew, ew!
No, seriously, seriously! Ew, ew!
I can't, I can't! Ew, ew!


Look at look at this. OM-effing-G, what the eff?
You're gonna freakin' flip, like, seriously freakin' flip
'Cause Sally's mad at Iggy because Iggy's booty's more biggy
And Sally's booty's twiggy so she called her friend Cybie
Now Sally's gonna get impleggies
What's impleggies? Implants, silly. Ew!
I'm freakin' for real
I think silicone butts are ew, ew!


Where'd she get that outfit? Ew
That girl is totally ratchet. Ew!
No, seriously â who likes that? Ew!
Right right? Ew, ew!

Look at the way she takes pics
And what's up with those duck lips?
She's so lame
Super lame. Ew, ew!

This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
No, seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
Oh my gosh. Ew, ew!


I am not hating
I am merely conversating
With my BFF Sara
So bust your rhyme, Sara...


It's Mir.I.Am and you know who
Now here's some things I think are ew!
FaceTime and reclining in
Airplane seats and then Vining
Retweeting tweets I'm not lying
'Cause even rhyming's ann-iy-ing!
Bread bowls and ravioli
Casserole, a roly poly
Caterpillar on my really old
And moldy windowsill. Ew!
Trapper keepers and a creeper wearin'
Sneakers with the toes
And maybe Frozen 'cause
You knowin' I don't
Wanna build a snowman. Ew, ew!

Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

Ew, ew, ew. Seriously? Ew.

Hello my name is Sara
That's Sara with no "H"
Too bad if you don't like it
'Cause haters gonna hate
my Stepdad Gary
He tries to act so cool
Every time we see him
My friends and I say "Ew!"


Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?

Oh my gosh, it's my step dad Gary
And he just ruined it!

I heard that funky beat that you was playing down here
It's a party over here
It's a party over here

Ew!
