Oh, let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
For Domani never comes

Domani, forget Domani
Let's live for now
And anyhow, who needs Domani

The moonlight
Let's share the moonlight
Perhaps together
We will never be again

Ah que luna, ah que mare
With such a moon and such a sea
And you with me

I get so dizzy when you're standing near
It's not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum

Let's take a minute as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say
When you're in love
Domani never comes

Oh, let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
For Domani never comes

Yeah, let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
For Domani never comes

Domani, forget Domani
With such a moon and such a sea
And you with me

Let's take those minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say
When you're in love
Domani never comes

Oh, let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
For tomorrow never comes

Yeah, let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
Let's forget about Domani
For Domani never comes
