Why don't you dream anymore?
What's in the way?
How come you point to the door
And ask me to stay?

Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do?
Why don't you stay for awhile?
Uh well, it's up to you

'Cause you are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl
Well you give me a twirl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Why don't you talk anymore?
What did I say?
How is it what I came for
Is floating away?

Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do?
Why don't you stay for awhile?
Uh well, it's up to you

'Cause you are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl (you are the girl)
Well you give me a twirl
You are the girl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Why don't you dream anymore?
What's in the way?
How come you point to the door
And you ask me to stay?

Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do?
Why don't you stay for awhile?
Uh 'cause it's up to you oh

You are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl (you are the girl)
Oh you give me a twirl
You are the girl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Well, you are the girl
You are the girl
And you give me a twirl
You are the girl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Oh, you are the girl
In my dreams
