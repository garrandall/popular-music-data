January to December
We'll have moments to remember

The New Year's Eve we did the town
The day we tore the goalpost down
We will have these moments to remember

The quiet walks, the noisy fun
The ballroom prize we almost won
We will have these moments to remember

Though summer turns to Winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years

When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember
...
