Ooh sing it
Cavemen dwell here
There's a circus in the sky
A place where dreamers dream
And we all can fly

Oh my
Yeah, that's good, lets make a trip to the bottleshop
Gotta pop, knock knock
Would you like to wobble chop?
'Till the rythm hop
Give the women cock
'Til the kittens savour days of play
Major flavour hey

Oh oh dear God
Can you get the kitten wet
Can you leap with frogs
Can you look into the sky
'Cause it's written in blood
And the music in your mind 's
Unconditional love

I can hear destiny echo off my fear
Dreams whispering, just feel the beats of
I'm coming down, we're just children having fun
Mics in the ground, If we build it they will come

To camp on the moon when the world's gold
And don't ever Look back, my mic is stole 
Its cold but its great when Im wrestling tigers
And wild when I'm flying X-wing fighters

The mistress of mystics missed it
Did you let your lips blurr, twisted
Words that leak a lisp
In my garden plot plotting them pops
I Won't stop 'till the jukebox copping a crop

I'm still holdin' it
With a fat wooden oar
Oh my I couldn't store
This in my belly anymore
Sick of mental cages, throw my telly at the door

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house here sure give up
To the people in the back and the front row
Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house give it up
To the crew Locked in that Looney bin HO

Lower the drawbridge to get over the Pub moat
And we don't sink 'cause we're bailing the tug boat
And observing the perks like a wise owl
Throw off the stools in search of a slice bowel
You a nice girl at the top of the ferris wheel
Getting acquainted with the sun rays, it's rare
It's reeling in the feeling to the way you purr
But you won't be mowed in the way I stir the cauldron

Relax and grow in a cauldron's water
All I want is to marry a sultans daughter
And be invisible when no one's looking
I'm an easy root touch my willy wood pecker

Damn straight I would like to tell you
I would like to get into you
You're revvin my engine now you're on my soul
But you stepped on a couple pennies in a mud hole

My feet barely touch when we drift on the sidewalk
Say, what big beautiful glass eyeballs
Step out the booth drenched in wet clothes
Waltz through the fuckin' head of DJ bros
I got a head full of memories a head full of blues
I got a head full of chemistry a head full of booze
I got a head full of dick for obnoxious folk
I got a head full of I wanna go rock this boat

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

I need some progress
Are we ready to roll, yes
Grab a piece of ass
Pass a piece of hash
Oh baby it's so fresh
Put your pedal to the metal in your shitbox ride
We got that bump, bounce, jump down
Get up and touch the sky

Forget this I'm not making my bed
I hate the motherfucking club, stop breaks your necks
I got hands in the air like whoop-e-dee-doo-dah
Intelligence hits when you look at it too hard

Ooh let's break free of this spell
People see when they yell
Sing to the song boy going straight into the convoy
Three stowaways

Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house here sure give up
To the people in the back and the front row
Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house give it up
To the crew locked in that looney bin HO

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

Praise to the weapon inspector for coming up with the bomb
We were just frisked by an old woman in the back lane
