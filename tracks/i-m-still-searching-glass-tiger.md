Oh, the rumours are vicious, my ears are burning
It's been a long hard day
Telephone rings, I still got nothing to say
Considerations tossed out the window
I feel a little bit wired
The rules say anything goes but I don't want to play

You said I could walk away
Take me back to where my life burns

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run

Took a long walk down through the backstreets
I heard the city scream
Reminds me of the time I run wicked and free

And now here I stand all alone
But I'm back to where my life burns

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run

One heart, one home
But I'm still holding on
I've loved, but I've roamed
And now I'm going home, going home, yeah

I'm still searching for something
Still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run
A broken heart and a life on the run
A broken heart, life on the run
