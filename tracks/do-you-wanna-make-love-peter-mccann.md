Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else

Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else

If you wanna get close to me
You could do it so easily
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie?

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Well, do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
