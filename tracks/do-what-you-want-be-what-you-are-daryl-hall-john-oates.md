My friends wonder why I call you all of the time
What can I say
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, no, I know that i'm right
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

(because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what i'm doing, I don't forget what i want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on
And if you insist on knowing my bliss

I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I'll only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you this
