Do what you want girl, but be what you are
There ain't no right er wrong way
Just a play from the heart
It ain't a sign of weakness to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on,
While the weak give up and stay


So do what you want to do
But be what you are...

Do you believe in hot cars,
Leather bars, or movie stars
Is that what's real
Payin' dues, Earth Shoes, Chicago blues
Is that how you feel?
You can change, but you can't conceal
What's deep inside you
It's your game, it's your deal


So do what you want to do
But be what you are...
