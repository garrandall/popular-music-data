Woo!

Smooth talkin', so rockin'
He's got everything that a girl's wantin'
Guitar cutie, he plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doin' somethin' stupid
Think I'm really fallin' for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name
Woo!

He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
And when he's lookin' at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
I can hardly breathe, something's tellin' me
Tellin' me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one

He's lightnin', sparks are flyin'
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and
I'm goin' crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racin'
Think I'm really diggin' on his vibe
He really blows me away, hey!

He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
And when he's lookin' at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
I can hardly breathe, something's tellin' me
Tellin' me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one

And he's got a way of makin' me feel
Like everything I do is perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I'm with him
And I'm so into him

He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
And when he's lookin' at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got somethin' special
He's got somethin' special
I can hardly breathe, something's tellin' me
Tellin' me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one (be the one)
