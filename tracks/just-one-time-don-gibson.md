If I could see you just one time oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time and then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so they now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine wish I could see you just one time
I I I I miss you so oh I need you so
I I I'd give this heart of mine if I could see you just one time

I I I I miss you so...
