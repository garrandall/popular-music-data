Yes, she blew through the door like TNT,
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me.
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time.
"I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline.
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country."

Yeah, the band took a break,
The DJ played P Diddy.
She said: "I didn't come here to hear,
"Somethin' thumpin' from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country."

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar.
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar.
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country."

Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closin' time."
She got this wild look on her face,
An' said: "Your truck or mine,
"I know a place down the road,
"It's kinda funky.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country."

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar.
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar.
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie.
"Ah-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country."
