My baby don't have to worry, she don't have to rob and steal
My baby don't have to worry, she don't have to rob and steal
I give her ev'rything she needs, I am her drivin' wheel
She left me this mornin', said she'd be back at soon
She left me this mornin', but she said she would be back soon
She'd be back early Friday morning or late Saturday afternoon
I wrote my baby a letter, don't want no one to break the seal
I wrote my baby a letter, don't want no one to break the seal
That letter goes to my baby, I am her drivin' wheel
Now wait a minute, I wanna tell you somethin'! (yeah!)
I wanna tell you about my baby! (yeah!)
I'm gonna tell ya about my baby! (yeah!)
Ev'ry time she walks, she's like a leaf shakin' on a tree
Ev'ry time she walks, she's like a leaf shakin' on a tree
I want you to c'mon baby, this is where you get your steak, potato's and tea
