Happy, happy hour
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Happy, happy hour
Come alive
After nine to five

Happy, happy hour (Oh, yeah)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!)
Come alive
After nine to five

After all the things you do
Within the working day
There's a time to ease your mind
And put your cares away

Come to the place
Where you can always have some fun
At the party your wheels get rolled in
Take your chance, get up and dance

Happy, happy hour (Happy hour)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!)
Come alive
After nine to five

You can come with all your friends
And make some new ones too
Everybody's there for reasons
Just the same as you

Come to the place
Where you can always have some fun
If you want some joy and laughter
Take a chance, get up and dance

Happy, happy hour (Yeah, yeah)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!) (Come on, boogie with me)
Come alive
After nine to five

Take your time for fun and leisure
You need to get away
There's no doubt it's gonna please you
Take your chance, get up and dance

Happy, happy hour (Happy, happy hour)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Happy, happy hour
Come alive
After nine to five

Happy, happy hour (Ohoho, yeah)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!)
Come alive
After nine to five

Live it up, live itup
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, yeah

Everybody come on down
This is the place to be
Let the party your wheels gettin' rollin'
Take your chance, get up and dance

Happy, happy hour (Yeah, yeah)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Happy, happy hour (This is the place, alright)
Come alive
After nine to five

Happy, happy hour (Happy hour)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine (I'm gonna)

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!)
Come alive
After nine to five

Happy, happy hour (Happy, happy, happy)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

Happy, happy hour (Baby)
Come alive
After nine to five

Happy, happy hour (Yeah, yeah)
Now's the time
Tonight you're mine

(I'm gonna)

Live it up, live it up (Woooh!)
Come alive
After nine to five
