Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
Ah, I'm walking on a cloud
I can't understand, Lord
I'm misty holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear, Lord
I'm misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you, ooh

On my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord
I'm misty and too much in love

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you, ooh

On my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord
I'm misty, and too much in love

(Misty) Too much in love
(Misty) Too much in love
(Misty)
(Misty) Too much in love
