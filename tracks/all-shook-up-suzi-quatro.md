Well, bless my soul. What's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
My hands are shaking and my knees are week
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine
When I'm with the girl that I love best
My heart beats so, and it scares me to death
She touches my hand and what a thrill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Well, bless my soul. What's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
