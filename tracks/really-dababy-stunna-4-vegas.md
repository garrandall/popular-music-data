This nigga Bankroll got it (Real niggas all gangstas)
On mami, (Uh) this nigga 4X got rich in six months, you heard? (Huh, no cap)
It's gotta be that Billion Dollar Baby Shit, know the fuck goin' on
Nigga really got rich in six months, for real, I watched that shit with my own eyes
Really three, but that nigga spend too much
Goddamn, this nigga get so much goddamn money, nigga, what the fuck? (Ten)


Oh my God, I got a taste of the Rich Youngin'
Okay (Okay), I'ma give them a taste of this shit
Uh, uh, uh, uh

He got rich in six months, how he do that? (How he do that?)
I keep my foot on their neck, but y'all knew that (Y'all knew that)
Where you goin'? Your shit'd got blewed back (Bah)
Your ass get whooped, said, "Smoke," we could do that (Ooh)
I break her neck, she like, "Who that?"
Your ho, these diamonds on me get your boo wet (Uh)
She ate the D like she knew me (Uh)
I'm the shit, hottest youngin', she already knew that (4X)

We all put a bitch up like a throwback (Freak ho)
She mixed the purp with the MoÃ«t (Uh)
So many racks, I got gold (Racks)
Hit the space and I dance in this bitch like I'm Kodak (Uh)
Make 'em freeze like he took a Kodak (Freeze)
My lil' nigga move on on my whistle
That bitch think I'm hot, sizzle
I'm a pitch (Uh), told me her nigga is shit (Uh, uh)
I won't go back and forth with no rap nigga, I got business to attend to
Too many racks to count, lil' nigga, I flip you (Flip)
We fit him up, wet him like a pencil (Brrt, brrt)
No diss, I'm tryna send a missile
I need M's, bitch, I'm on a mission (Cash)
I'm with my shooter, but I got a stick, too (Uh, he up)
He up, then I'm uppin' this bitch 'til it click, too (Bah)

He got rich in six months, how he do that? (How he do that?)
I keep my foot on their neck, but y'all knew that (Y'all knew that)
Where you goin'? Your shit'd got blewed back (Bah)
Your ass get whooped, said, "Smoke," we could do that (Ooh, let's go)
I break her neck, she like, "Who that?"
Your ho, these diamonds on me get your boo wet (Uh)
She ate the D like she knew me (Uh)
I'm the shit, hottest youngin', she already knew that (4X)


I say, "We gon' call that boy Rich Youngin'" (Rich)
He got rich in six months, I can vouch (Let's go)
Okay, you done got slick at the mouth (Yeah)
That lil' bitch talkin' shit, kick her out (Like, bitch)
I made my young niggas do that (Yeah), go pull up and post up a pic at your house (Cheese)
Make him tap, BDB in the cab (Let's go)
Beat his ass with that stick, he come out (Okay)
I done went and spent a whole lot of money with Johnny, I got a whole brick in my mouth (Yessir)
My bitch get the money, bitch send the deposit if you want my bitch to come out (No cap)
They want fuck me, big 4 on my DJ (Big Fo')
Throw my shirt on a ho, it's on eBay
Windows down and heat on on the freeway (Hm)
I pull up with Rich Youngin', they holler, that nigga


Got rich in six months, how he do that? (How he do that?)
I keep my foot on their neck, but y'all knew that (Y'all knew that)
Goin'-where you goin'? Your shit'd got blewed back (Bah)
Your ass get whooped, said, "Smoke," we could do that (Ooh, let's go)
I break her neck, she like, "Who that?"
Your ho, these diamonds on me get your boo wet (Uh)
She ate the D like she knew me (Uh)
I'm the shit, hottest youngin', she already knew that (4X)


Baby
It's Baby and Baby and 4X
I ran that lil' shit up in no time
I'm puttin' dick in your bitch and we lock eyes
I'm so high, start a fire when I walk in
Hit her friend, I ain't stop when she walk in (Next)
I can drop every money, go top ten
Make her do what I say, let her get what she want
Bitch, you better shut up when I'm talkin' (Shut up)
Lotta cars, how the fuck I miss walkin'? (Never)
I drop hit after hit, I don't miss (Nah)
'Posed to be someone servin' in one of them houses
With pounds, how the fuck I get rich?
Who the Hell say that life was a bitch?
I got too many bitch, but one life to live
Fuck how they feel, if we got a problem then money'll solve it
My daughters and followers and match
I really started from scratch, pills in the pack
Now I get millions to rap, influence the youngins to trap
Put my whole hood on the map, first the water was tap
Now a jet for a nap, now the motor the back
Me promotion' with rats, put her head in my lap
And my hand on the strap, ain't no dyke shit
On the Chief Keef, "I Don't Like" shit
