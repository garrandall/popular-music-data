If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?


Right about now.
If a judge for-life me,
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?

If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life,
Shorty, would it be alright?
Come and show me that you are down
(ah-ha)

Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?
(what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?

Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?


If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?


Skiddly-dong-dong-dong dang.
All I want is somebody real who don't need much.
A girl I know that I can trust,
To be here when money low.

If I did not have nothing else to give but love,
Would that even be enough?
(tell me, tell me, tell me)
Girl, meh need fi know 
(ah-ha)

Now, tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?
(what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?

Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?


If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?


Tell me, tell me, would you want me?
(want me)
Tell me, tell me, would you call me?
(call me)
If you knew I wasn't ballin'
'Cause I need a gal who's always by my side...

Tell me, tell me, do you need me?
(need me)
Tell me, tell me, do you love me? Yeah.
Or is ya just tryna play me?
'Cause I need a gal to hold me down for life.


If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?

If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?

Would you still love me the same?
