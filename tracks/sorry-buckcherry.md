Oh I had a lot to say
Was thinking all my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same

'Cause everything inside
It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me wanna die

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"

This time I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame

'Cause everything inside
It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me wanna die

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"

Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights
And the tears you've cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah sorry!

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"

I'm sorry, baby
I'm sorry, baby
Yeah I'm sorry
