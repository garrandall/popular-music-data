Take a good look at me
Tell me do you like what you see
Do you think you can
Do you think you can do me
Kiss me pretty baby
And touch me all over
Girl what makes you think you can do me
Do you think you can do me girl?


Do me baby
(oh)
Do me baby
(do you think you can)
Do me baby
(do me)
Do me baby
(oh yeah)


Girl let your hair down
Take off your clothes and leave on your shoes
Would you mind if I look at you for a moment
Before I make sweet love
Backstage, under age, adolescent
"How ya doin'?" "Fine," she replied
I siiighed, I like to do the wild thing
Action took place
Kinda wet
Don't forget
The J the I the M the M the Y y'all
I need a body bag


Do me baby
(oh)
Do me baby
(you can do me when you wanna do me)
Do me baby
(yeah yeah)
Do me baby
(oh yeah)
Do me baby
(I like it in the morning time)
Do me baby
(sometimes I love it in the evening baby)
Do me baby
(can you do me all over girl)
Do me baby
(oh yeah)


The time was 6 o'clock on the Swatch watch
No time to chill, got a date
Can't be late
Hey, the girl is gonna do me
Move to the jacuzzi
Oh that booty
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down, oh no...


Do me baby
(yeah)
Do me baby
(oh I like it just like that)
Do me baby
(oh yeah)
Do me baby
(oh move just a little bit closer)


You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
