Oh, how I miss you tonight
Miss you while lights are low
Oh, how I need you tonight
More than you'll ever know

Each moment though we're apart
You're never out of my heart
But I'd rather be lonely
And wait for you only
My darling
I miss you tonight

Yes, darling
I am lonesome tonight
The days are so long
Seems everything's wrong

For now
I'm lonesome and blue
I still love you, dear
I wish you were here
Come back, forgive me
Please do

Each moment though we're apart
You're never out of my heart
But I'd rather be lonely
And wait for you only
My darling
I miss you tonight
