Little one it's so nice to have you near me
To feel once again the love you bring here
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear


Oh my little one
Bring your love here
Little one
I need you near
Little one
Don't live in fear of the future
Because I will always be there


Oh my little one
Music is my life, I hope you understand
Traveling on the road with me you can see the way we live
Oh my little one
I will always cherish these days with you
As time goes by I hope you see the love I tried to give


Oh my little one
Let your love flow
My little one
Like a flower you'll grow
Someday you'll have your own little one
And you will always be there


Little one, it's so nice to have you near me
To feel once again the love you bring here
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear




Oh my little one
Let your love flow
My precious one
Like a flower you'll grow
Little one
Someday you'll have your own little one
And you will always be there


My little one
My little one
