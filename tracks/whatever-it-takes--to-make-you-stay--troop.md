Whatever it takes (to make you stay)
Lyrictext

Girl, have you talked to your man yet?
My man hasn't even called me yet
Then, what about you
I haven't talked to my man, either
They have been gone too long
This is just too hard
Well, I knew it was going to be hard when they left
But this is ridiculous
He's gonna have to do something real special
When he gets back
Well, whatever it takes

I know I can't always be there,
When you call my name, ah, yeah
Sometimes baby,
I know you think it ain't fair
When I ain't there
But I care

Well baby I know,
You got a life of your own
You need something more
Than just a romance on the phone

Never forget, you're not alone
When something's wrong
Baby that just won't do
Because I don't want to be without you

Whatever it takes to make you stay
Stay as my lover
Whatever it takes to make you stay
Stay as my girl, stay as my woman

Others try to make you think you need
Material things, ah, yeah (baby)
Offer you a life that's filled with greed
But it don't compare
To what we share (our love is rare)

Well baby I know
With all that's going on
I'm gonna do my best
To just keep us going on
Going on, going strong

I just want to let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

Whatever it takes to make you stay
(Whatever it takes, baby)
Stay as my lover
Whatever it takes to make you stay
Stay as my girl,
Our love is rare

Baby, I know you got a life of your own
You need something more
Not another romance on the telephone
Never forget, you're not alone
(When something's wrong)
Baby, that just won't do,
I can't have me, without you

Whatever it takes to make you stay
(You stay)

Stay as my lover
(My baby, stay as my lover)
Whatever it takes to make you stay
(Stay baby)
Stay as my girl,
(Stay as my lady)
Our love is rare

Whatever it takes
My baby
Whatever it takes, my baby girl
If it takes the world,
I can't live alone
C'mon baby
