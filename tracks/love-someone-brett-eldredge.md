Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don't ever wanna move

You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in my knees
You put me right where I'm supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away

'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I'm falling to you
Over and over and over again

When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I've ever been
Everything I'll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me

When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
Sure feels good
