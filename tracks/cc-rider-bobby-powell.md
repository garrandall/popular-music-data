(Do you love, can you love)
(A girl like that)

I wanna ask you one question
Tell me, how do you feel
When you lose the one
That you really need

What do you do
Tell me, what do you say
When the one you love
Refuse to look your way

You just say, C (C.C. Rider)
Oh, C.C. Rider (C.C. Rider)
Well, look and see (C.C. Rider)
What you've done (C.C. Rider)

Call her one more time now
Say, C.C. Rider
(C.C. Rider, what you done to him)
Girl, look and see (C.C. Rider)
Just what you've done (C.C. Rider)

You made me love you, baby
And right now, your man has come
(C.C. Rider) oh, yes, he has
(See just what you have done)

You just say C, C.C. Rider
Lord, every night
The moon shines so bright

Lord, every day and night now (C.C. Rider)
Every day, C.C. Rider
(What you done to him)
I been all alone and by myself

And if you never
Lord, if you never return
I tell you I don't want
I just don't want nobody else

Lord, Lord, C (C.C. Rider)
Oh, C.C. Rider (C.C. Rider)
Girl, look and see (C.C. Rider)
Just what you've done (C.C. Rider)

Lord, C (C.C. Rider)
Said C.C. Rider
(What you done to him)
Girl, don't you know (C.C. Rider)
You hurt me so bad (C.C. Rider)

You made me love you, baby
Whoa, yes, you did
And now your man has come
(C.C. Rider) oh, yes, he has
(See just what you have done)
