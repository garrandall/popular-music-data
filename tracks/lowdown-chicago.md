Oh my
Life has passed me by
The country I was brought up in
Fell apart and died
Oh no
Love's no longer there
Cold wind blew away the sun
That used to warm the air
Lowdown
Ooo! Feelin' pretty bad
Feelin' like I lost the best friend
That I ever had
Lowdown
Ooo! Got to find a way
Got to make the people see
The way I feel today
