Yes, I'm lonesome tonight
Oh, so lonesome tonight
Why did you leave me this way

I can still feel your arms
And the thrill of your charms
When you kissed me
That bright summer day

Now the place is so empty
Since you've gone away
And I'm hoping and praying
You'll come home to stay

How my heart cries for you
Won't you come back
Please do

Don't you know that
I'm lonesome tonight

My darling
I'm so lonesome tonight
Friends tell me you've said
The world's a stage and
We each must play a part
True, but I wasn't playing
I gave you my heart

When you looked in my eyes
I fell in love with you
You were my Prince Charming
My dreams had all come true
Then suddenly, you said I changed
As if arranged

But I couldn't understand
And you did try your
Best to make believe
But your kisses
Were not the same

Yes, you told all our friends
That I had lied when you knew
This could never be true

For deep in your heart
You know who lied
But I don't really care
If only you would hear my plea
Forget, forgive, come back to me

How my heart cries for you
Won't you come back
Please do

Don't you know that
I'm lonesome tonight
