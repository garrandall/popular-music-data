Don't wanna love you
Don't wanna make you my wife
Don't wanna see ya
Everyday for the rest of my life


All I want is a one-night affair (One night affair)
Oh, I got to have
(One night affair)
Oh, I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'm a son-of-a gun
(Son of a gun)
I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will, yes, I will


Yes, I'll wine and dine ya
Take you anywhere you wanna go
And when the night is over
I don't want to see you no more


All I want is a one-night affair (One night affair)
Oh, let me have
(One night affair)
Oh, I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'm a son-of-a gun
(Son of a gun)
I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will, yes, I will


Oh, I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again


Oh, I
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will
(Son of a gun)
Yes, I am
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will
All I want is a one-night affair (One night affair)
Oh, let me have
(One night affair)
Oh, I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'm a son-of-a gun
(Son of a gun)
I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will, yes, I will


Oh, I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again


Oh, I
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will
(Son of a gun)
Yes, I am
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will
All I want is a one-night affair (One night affair)
Oh, let me have
(One night affair)
Oh, I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
I'm a son-of-a gun
(Son of a gun)
I'll hit and run
(Hit and run)
Yes, I will, yes, I will
