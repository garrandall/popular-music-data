Song came and went,like the times that we spend
I melt from the rain,under the carnival tent
I'd laugh and he'd smile
And it would last for a while
You don't know what you got til you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break,any time that he goes away
Listen to the banjo with a sad song
Driftin along
Listen to my tears roll
Down my face as he turns to go

Cool evening dance
Listenin to the bluegrass band
Takes the chill from the end til they play the last song
And I'll do my time,keeping you off my kind
But theres moments that I fing I'm not feelin so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break,any time that he goes away
Listen to the banjo with a sad song
Driftin along
Listen to my tears roll
Down my face as he turns to go

Now on the lake shore I hear the love song of a summer storm,
That played on the lake like a mandolin
Now its washin him away once again
Once again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break,any time that he goes away
Listen to the banjo with a sad song
Driftin along
Listen to my tears roll
Down my face as he turns to go
