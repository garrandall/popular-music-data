Aye Girl

Which one of ya'll...? 
 (Aye Boy)
Wana remix with me and..

(Usher Baby. Come in the booth, no hands)


Now normally I play the nice guy.
Tonight ima show the other side.
Want me to grab you by your neck
I can tell it make you wet
Ooo girl it aint workin unless you sweatin (nowww)
Brought you back girl
Arch your back girl
Meet me upstairs, so I can beat it upstairs
Leave that teddy on
Take them panties off
Like Trey say "I Cant Help But Wait"
Got that oven pre-heated
Trey invented sex, but he aint teach you how to eat it
On ya back now, spread it out now.
Oooohhh!

(Listen Baby, now normally I dont do this but..umm)

Which one of yall?
Which two of yall?
Which two of yall goin home with Usherrrr?

When I get you to the crib
I'ma lay you out on the bed
Girl what ya think?
Girl what ya think?
Girl what ya think?
Girl what ya think?
Our lovin up in the sky
Indroduce you to the mile high
Girl you gone think 
Girl you gone think
I'ma make you think
I'ma make you think, make you think I re-invented sex!

(Ooooo, you think you invented sex)
(Boy you think you invented sex)


I'm bout to re-invent sex
Keri got em like who's next?
And ima make it my duty
to have you so wooosy
You think I invented Ex,
(Yea) Some say it aint nothing new under the sun
You never seen a bitch do what I done
When your soldier's at attention
And my loving is the mission
Boy missionary's no good.
On my body like you knockin on wood.
And if any one of yall in here could.
(I wish I could)
Get Miss Keri Babbyyy!

Back to ya crib
Upstairs in ya bed
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?
If you pull back them sheets
Ya climb on top of me
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?
Boy would I think?


You gone think I invented sex

Would I think you invented sex?

You gone think I invented sex

Would I think you invented sex?


Already know
Aint you seen the video?
Get some ice in ya life
Lick it, lick it slow
Imagine how I'm really tho
I mean imagiine how I'm sexin
Nobody directin
Nobody to cut, only you & me tho
Wana make your body blast off, torpedo
Forget about the missionary
Girl you know we grown
Put you in postitions that you never even known
You know the plumber like pipe down
Them ladies in the stores like right now
I mean right now
Girl I'm bout to turn the lights down
If you ready scream right now
We on the mantle
Shawty dismantled
Hit it from the side, show you how to love handle
Got you with the toes curled up
No sandals
Baby ima write my name on it
No vandal (?)
Going in, grabbin yo butt
Goin in, like a Tiger Woods putt
Goin in, like the Lil Wayne, Drake song

Girl if Trey Songz in ya crib
Kissn all on ya neck
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
Girl you gone think.
You gone think I invented sex.

(You gone think I invented sex)
