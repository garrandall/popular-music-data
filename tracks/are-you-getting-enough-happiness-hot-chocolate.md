Every time I go to the movies
All I see is happy love on the silver screen
Everywhere I go, I see men and women lovin'
Kissin' and a huggin', enjoyin' life

Oh, what's the matter with me, am I lonely?
Is there anybody out there who feels the same?
Every time I turn on my TV
I see somebody lovin' somebody

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Every time I open a book or read a magazine
There's happy love everywhere I look
Every page I turn I can read between the lines
That the boys gonna get it, get it tonight

Well, what's the matter with me? Am I the only one?
Oh, is there somebody out there who feels the same?
Every time I turn on my radio
I hear a love song playin' on every show

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

I need excitement in my life
I need happiness, happiness every night
I need someone to call upon
When the need is strong for lovin', lovin'

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Are you getting enough, kissin', huggin', lovin'?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough lovin'?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Are you getting enough of happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough of happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough of happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
