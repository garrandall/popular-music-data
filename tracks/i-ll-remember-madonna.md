Mmm, mmm


Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that


And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember


Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing


And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember


I learned
To let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness


And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
Mmm... (I'll remember)
Mmm...


And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember


No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, â€‹I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
