Yeah, dig it, what a show we got for you tonight folks. And here to get things rollin' is the fabulous Mildred Queen and the Dipsticks, yeah..."

"I love you ; yes I do , really do ; and I just wanted to take the time to show how much you really mean to me ; and I promise to love and be yours forever if you'll only stay with me ; wait a minute ; how come you sayin' everything that I say? ; now cut that out! ; stop that! ; now I know why they call you guys the dips ; you're dippy ; ah "

"How about that all you hippie, dudes, and chickies out there! Mildred Queen and the Dips here on the Moonlight Special!"
