Hey - hey hey
Oh-oh, whoa oh oh, oh oh

Log on to hide ad.

Two dances goin' around the nation
With the same beat
That's the combination of a
Good timin' and a finger pumpin'
Arm bendin' and hips rockin'

Besides, doesn't matter
Just get your steps together now
Jerk and Twine
(And do the Twine)

The Jerk is jumpin'
For miles around
The Twine is the thing in Chicago town
With a good timin'
And a finger-pumpin'
And a arm-bendin'
And a hips rockin'

So boys, and girls
Let's give it a whirl now
Jerk, and Twine

The Jerk and Twine ain't hard to do
Now all it does is bring the soul out of you
You just pop your fingers
Sorta bend your back
You got the right idea
I say I think it like that
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The Jerk and Twine
Will help you make friends
Grab her body now
Do the few steps in
With just a good timin'
And a finger-pumpin'
And a arm-bendin'
And a hips rockin'

The age doesn't matter
Just get yourself together now
Jerk, and Twine
I tell ya age doesn't matter
Just get your steps together
Come on Jerk and Twine

They're doin' it in Chicago
And Detroit too
??? Out in L.A.
In New York it's the thing to do
Catchin' on in Philly
Turnin' up and down the coast
