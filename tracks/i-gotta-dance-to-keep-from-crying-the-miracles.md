Come on everybody we're gonna have a party right now!
I'm tired of sitting around here feeling blue

Gather 'round me swingers and friends
Help me forget my hurt within
About the only girl I ever loved
The only one I'm thinking of

And I've gotta dance to keep from crying
I've gotta dance to keep from crying oh-oh-ah
Do the monkey and do the twist
Everybody, it goes like this

Come on and dance for me swingers it's alright
Dance for me swingers all night
Cause nights are lonely since we parted
And memories leave me so brokenhearted

I've gotta dance to keep from crying
I've gotta dance to keep from crying
Do the bird, do the fly
Come on, gang, bop bop bop bop

Do the bang, that you feel
Everybody dance, don't stay still

Dance for me swingers all night
Dance for me swingers all night
Heartaches have gathered 'round me
Misery has surely found me

I've gotta dance to keep from crying
I've gotta dance to keep from crying oh-oh-ah
Gather 'round me girls and boys
I think we're making too much noise
So get soft, oh-ah, just a little bit soft
Just a little bit soft, soft, soft
Just a little bit softer softer softer oh
Just a little bit softer
(Just a little bit higher)

Come on and dance for me swingers
Dance for me swingers
Do the monkey and do the twist
Everybody do the twist
Do the bird, do the fly
Come on you can do it if you try
Dance for me swingers
Dance for me swingers
