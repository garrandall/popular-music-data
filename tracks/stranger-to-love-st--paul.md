I've been around,
I searched the whole world over.
Lookin' for
Unconditional love.

I hear the sound,
A million hearts in motion.
I feel the passion,
But it never seems enough.

But you me,
The Earth moves under my feet.
The walls came tumblin' down.


I've been through the fire,
Right down to the wire,
But I'm still a stranger to love.
I've felt desire,
And it took me higher,
But I'm still a stranger to love.


Time after time,
I felt infatuation,
But the feelin' disappears,
In the mornin' light.

Losin' my mind,
I searched in desperation.
No rhyme or reason,
If it got me through the night.

You start a fire,
That I never felt before.
Could you be the one girl,
To open up the door.



Let me tell ya



Ohh, oh, oh, yeah.
Ohh, oh, oh, yeah.
Ohh, oh, oh...
A stranger to love.

Ohh, oh, oh, yeah.
Ohh, oh, oh, yeah.
Ohh, oh, oh...
A stranger to love.

But you? me,
The Earth moves under my feet.
The walls came tumblin' down.



I've been lookin' for love,
And it's so hard to find.
I'm still a stranger to love.

My search is over now that you're mine
I'm still a stranger to love.
I've felt desire,
And it took me higher,
But I'm still a stranger to love.
