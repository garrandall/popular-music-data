Calling all boys (boys)
Calling all girls (girls)
Calling all people on streets
Around the world


Take this message
A message for you
This message is old, yeah
This message is true

Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear


Some sleepless nights in wait for you
Some foreign presence you feel
Comes creeping through
Some stream of hope
The whole world through
Spread like some silent disease
You'll get yours too

Far and near
Take a message of love
