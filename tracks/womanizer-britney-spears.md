Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are
What you are, baby
Look at you, getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are
What you are, baby


Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)


Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer


Daddy-O, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me for a sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way, I'm never gonna fall for you
Never you, baby


Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)


Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer


Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you...


Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)


Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer


Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
