I'm not a little boy, I've lived alone and never loved so more
But when she touches me I'm on the way, I'm underneath the floor

Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like in in the sun I melt away

I sit down in a chair and read a book as if I couldn't there
But she is in a room and I must look I see her everywhere

Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like in in the sun I melt away

She opens up her eyes as if to speak
She looks at me and I am weak
Her eyes they seem much bigger than before
I cannot think anymore

Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like in in the sun I melt away

Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt away
