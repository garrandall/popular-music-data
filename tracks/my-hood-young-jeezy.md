Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

The streets love Jeezy and I love 'em back
And if I still had the work, I frontcha sack, hey
It's all gravy, still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good like the first and the third

Take you back when I was sixteen, wit a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped, we ran to dem cars

And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from January 'til the end of December
Wasn't smokin' purple, then it was more like Bobby Brown
On that hen dog straight, got a nigga drinking brown

You, you, 7/11, nigga you know
You know 10 to 4, shake 'em up, talk shit, get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road, the gangstas stay in touch
Why the fuck you think they love me so much

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

I'm talking summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing, we hearing shots all night
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out, running wit they guns, 5-0, 5-0

Ford Taurus leave, everybody came back, hey
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
Real recognize, real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows

Got the deal, nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects, fuckin' wit dem hoes, projects
Like coo-coo cal
Lord, I wish mad Lou could see me now

Wish gold mouth was home, mailman was free
A lot of niggaz crossing over, no dog, no, not me
Close to ever been in the commercials, when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Ford Taurus pull up, everybody run
White boys jump out, running wit they guns
Ford Taurus leave, everybody came back, hey
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood
