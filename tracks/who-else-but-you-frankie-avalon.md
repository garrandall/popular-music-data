Who can make a rainy day
Smile at me in such a sunny way
Ask and you'll hear my heart say
Who else but you

Who can make a lonely night
Laugh and sing with
Just her very sight
Fill my arms with such delight
Who else but you

When things go wrong
Who understands
And makes me strong
With a touch of her hand

And who can make my every tear
Change it's mind
And want to disappear
True, the answer's very clear
Who else but you

When things go wrong
Who understands
And makes me strong
With a touch of her hand

And who can make my every tear
Change it's mind
And want to disappear
True, the answer's very clear
Who else but you

Who else but you
Who else but you
