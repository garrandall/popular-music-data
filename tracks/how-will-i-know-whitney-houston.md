There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?


Oh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?


How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?


Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
Oh tell me


How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?


How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?


If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?


How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?


How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I know?
How will I know?
