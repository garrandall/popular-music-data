Oooh yeah, mmmm
Breakthrough

Up, down, spinnin all around
Fly, high, falling to the ground
Sometimes dreams can feel so far away

Time, keeps, skippin' out a beat
Left, right, trippin' on your feet
Life is like a string of cloudy days

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's proving to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on moving on
Keep on moving on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all a breakthrough
Just turn the page
'Cause everyday I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop till you break it through
Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop till you break it all through

Stop, still, take another breath
Road block, move it to the left
Get around whatever's in your way

Heartbreak, pick up all the pieces
Don't stop dancin' in the bleachers
It's gonna be your turn to play
Gonna be your turn to play

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin' to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on movin' on
Keep on movin' on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all about a breakthrough
Just turn the page
'Cause everyday I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

You can see it in the blind sight
Movin' through the limelight
Groovin' to the music imma use it when the time's right
Hoping I can do it through the shadows, I can shine bright
Usually in life there's one short, this is our night
Listen to the rhythm that we given and it will make you
Start pushin' the barriers and it will take you
Wherever it is you wanna go, never too late to
Keep pushing till you breakthrough

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin' to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on movin' on
Keep on movin' on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all about a breakthrough
Just turn the page
'Cause everyday I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop till you break it all through
Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop till you break it all through
Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop till you break it all through
Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
Don't stop
Here comes a breakthrough
