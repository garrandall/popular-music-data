In The Driver s Seat

I got one foot on the gas
I got one eye on the law
I got my mind on that pretty little gal
I passed about a mile ago
There ain t no way you can catch me
I got a car that can t be beat
With a A-one, long gone, white line outlaw
Sittin' in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat

I got one hand on the wheel
I got one long road ahead
I got pity on you old smoky
Gotta try to chase down Johnny Reb
There ain t no way you can catch me
I got a car that can t be beat
With a A-one, long gone, white line outlaw
Sittin' in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat

I only know one way to live
And that way's my way
And you can try to tame me if you must
But you ll just hear me flyin' down that old highway
And all you ll see of me is a big ol' cloud of dust
Yeah

I got one foot on the gas
I got one eye on the law
I got my mind on that pretty little gal
I passed about a mile ago
There ain t no way you can catch me
I got a car that can t be beat
With a A-one, long gone, white line outlaw
Sittin' in the driver s seat

I m in the driver s seat

With a A-one, long gone, white line outlaw
Sittin' in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
I m in the driver s seat
