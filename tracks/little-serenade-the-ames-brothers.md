La la la la...

Just a little street
Down in Puerto Fino
Just a little tune
That is softly played

Just a boy in love
With a mandolino
Just a little moonlight
Little serenade

Just a little song you
Can win her heart with
Telling of a love
That will never fade

Many a romance has been
Known to start with
Just a little moonlight
Little serenade

La la la la...

Happy is the boy
When he looks up above
And he sees that her
Window is open wide

Happy is the boy when
She throws her carnation
With an invitation
To come inside

Just a boy and girl
And a mandolino
Just a little kiss
As the vow is made

That's the way it is
Down in Puerto Fino
Just a little moonlight
Little serenade
(Little serenade)

Happy is the boy
When he looks up above
And he sees that her
Window is open wide

Happy is the boy when
She throws her carnation
With an invitation
To come inside

Just a boy and girl
And a mandolino
Just a little kiss
As the vow is made

That's the way it is
Down in Puerto Fino
Just a little moonlight
Little serenade

It's the story of
A little serenade
(Serenade)
