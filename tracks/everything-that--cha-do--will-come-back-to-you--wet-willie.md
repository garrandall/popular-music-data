Wet Willie
Oh depression
Got you guessing about the thing that you do
Don't you let it
You can bet it
She'll make a fool outa you
When confusion keeps ya loosin'
And you're searchin' for a find
Turn this madness
Into gladness
Keep these words in your mind
Everything
That you do
Will come back to you
Eyes wide open
See the motion
Of the problems that go down
You can't stop em
Better drop em
Don't let em turn you around
When you hear
That voice inside
Why don't you let it be your guide
Don't you know
You just can't go
Wrapped up in your foolish pride
From: Malcolm Clark
