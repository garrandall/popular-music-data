Alvin, put that harmonica down

Why

Because we're gonna sing, that's why

Not again

Never mind. Now look fellas
This is a pretty song so let's try not to goof it up
Are you ready, Simon

Sure, let's go

All set, Theodore

Hot dog, you bet

Are you ready
Alvin Ready
Alvin ALVIN

Aw, nuts

We sure like girls all kind of girls
From Anie to Veronica
We like them small or fat or tall

I wanna play my harmonica
Now cut that out

And everyone to get a kiss
We take them through for popcorn
Because they always fall in love

When I play my harmonicorn (sic)

Alvin

Will you put that thing down and sing

OK

We sure like girls all kind of girls
From Annie to Veronica
We like them small or fat or tall

I'm gonna play my harmonica

All right, Alvin. Make a fool of yourself
Play the harmonica
After a few bars of harmonica music
The Chipmunks suddenly burst out with "Cha-cha-cha"

Now wait a minute, you guys
Alvin, you're goofing it all up
This was a pretty song, it's not supposed to be a-

Cha-cha-cha

Now look what you did
You got them all cha-chaing and singing and wrecking the song
Theodore... Simon... orchestra will you cut that out
Alvin put that harmonica down
Alvin Alvin
