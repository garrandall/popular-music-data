They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishin' hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll


Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them ol' county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll


Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll


Yeah they're spinnin' their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them ol' county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From that ball and a glove to them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

Aw come on now!

Yeah they're cryin aloud
Humble and proud
They love momma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know
