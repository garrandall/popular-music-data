(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)
La la la la la la la la
(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)

Oh they told me I was such a fool to love you
They say that you're the kind who'll never be true
Pretty soon the day would come
When I'd be the sorry one
But I said that I'm not afraid

Oh, (That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)
La la la la la la la la
(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)

I went ahead and my heart opened the door
I gave you so much love no one could want more
You pretended to be mine
How could you be so unkind?
With all the other girls you played with, yeah

(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)
La la la la la la la la
(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)

Oh, (That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)

(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)

I know you're not sincere and you'll never be
But still I want your kisses so desperately
I could never let you go
Baby even though I know
Every rule of love you disobey

Oh, (That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)
La la la la la la la la
(That's how, that's how
Heartaches are made)
