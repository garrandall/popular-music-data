This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone

Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearranged
And she would never be the same again

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about and she's learning
Learning to live

This girl tasted love
As tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear
A teardrop that was sweet and warm

Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died
A woman had been born

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about and she's learning
Learning to live

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about and she's learning, learning, learning to live

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl
