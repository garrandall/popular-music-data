Well, I don't think that this is the original key
But I use to play the song with those chords, have fun
I'll give you my heart, would you love me forever?

I learned when I was a young boy
You turn your cheek you get slapped
I take the punches I can't slip and I give it right back

Even if I win girl, you know it really won't mean too much
What I want baby most of all is the only thing I can't touch

If I give you my heart would you love me forever
Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall?
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all
