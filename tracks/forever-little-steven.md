I hold your hand and watch as the sun slowly fades
Far in the distance the Father is calling your name
And itâs time for you to go home
And everything in me wants to hold on
But Iâm letting you go with this goodbye kiss and this promise

Iâll see you in a little while
Iâll see you in a little while
It wonât be too long now
Weâll see it on the other side
The wait was only the blink of an eye
So Iâm not gonna say goodbye
âCause Iâll see you in a little while

And just one more thing before I let you go
Please tell my little girl I love her
Though Iâm sure she already knows
And ask the Father to please tell the Son
That weâre ready and waiting for Him to come

Iâll see you in a little while
Iâll see you in a little while
It wonât be too long now
Weâll see it on the other side
The wait was only the blink of an eye
So Iâm not gonna say goodbye
âCause Iâll see you in a little while

Maybe youâll teach me all the songs they sing in heaven
Maybe youâll show me how you can fly
And Iâll hear you laugh again
And we wonât remember when
We were not together and this time itâs forever

Iâll see you in a little while
Iâll see you in a little while
It wonât be too long now
Weâll see it on the other side
The wait was only the blink of an eye
So Iâm not gonna say goodbye
âCause Iâll see you in a little while
Iâm gonna see you in a little while
