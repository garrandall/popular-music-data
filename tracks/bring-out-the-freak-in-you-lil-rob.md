Let's get N-A-S-T-Y
Get ready for a nasty time
All the nasty things we can do
I wanna bring out the freak in you
Let me bring out the freak in you


I like seein you
Can't help but think nasty thoughts about me and you
All them nasty things we can do
Let me bring out the freak in you
There's somethin I see in you
I definitely see me in you
Doin what nasty people do
Can you blame me? Look at the ass on you
How the fuck can I pass on you?
Classy lookin freak, nasty attitude
I just have to be havin you
It must be like heaven just to handle you
Lay you down turn you inside out
Watch it slide in, and slide out
Hey girl you got a pretty mouth
Tease me a bit, lick your lips, suck your fingertips


Let's get N-A-S-T-Y
Get ready for a nasty time
All the nasty things we can do
I wanna bring out the freak in you
Let me bring out the freak in you
I wanna bring out the freak in you
Let me bring out the freak in you


Mmm, you look so good with me
And I look so good with you
Got me infatuated
With them nasty things you do
You look so good
And I just know you feel so good inside
I love your eyes, your creamy thighs
Now baby, open wide
I love the way you touch yourself
Rub yourself down, finger fuck yourself
Lookin like you enjoy yourself
Watchin me watch you, makin me want you
Even more you know what you do
I'm a man that knows what to do
And I'm a man that knows what I like
Turn around, titties down, ass up that's right

So sexy the way you move
The way that you bend your body
Only keeps me in the mood
Get too exotic, so naughty
I love that look on your face
You give them feel good expressions
I really dig your foreplay
Let's triple X in sex sessions
Bring your body close to mine
I think it's time that you blow my mind
Even though this foreplay's fun
The night isn't done until we both cum
