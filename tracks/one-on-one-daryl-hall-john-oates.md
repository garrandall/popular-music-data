I'm tired of playing on the team
Ooooh, it seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score
And oh, oh, I can feel the magic of your touch
Umm-humm, And when you move in close
A little bit means so much
And ooh yeah, you've got to understand, baby
Time out is what I'm here for

Whoooa, one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know
I wanna play that one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow
Ooooooh-oh

Oooooh, you can't tell me you don't miss me girl
I think I might know you too well, whooooa
I (wonder what) you'd say if you knew
That I was coming tonight
(Want to)
I want you can't you tell

Ooooh, whoooa, one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know
I wanna play that one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow
Ooooooh-oh
That's all you need to know now



'Cause if it's really right
There's nothing else
One on one
I wanna play that game tonight
Ooooh-oh mmmmmmm
One on one
I wanna play that game tonight
(One on one)
Ooooooh-oh
One on one
I wanna play that game tonight
(One on one I wanna play that game tonight)
Ooooooh-oh
One on one I wanna play that game
(One) on one (on one) on one, girl
(On one) ooooooh, there's nothing else
(On one) but you and me (on one)
I want no one else (on one)
I don't want no one else (on one)
Oh, baby, I'm tired of playing (on one)
I'm tired of playing (on one)
I don't want to play those games no more...
