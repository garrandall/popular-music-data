This is dedicated to the one I love

While I'm far away from you, my baby
I know it's hard for you, my baby
Because it's hard for me, my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn

Each night before you go to bed, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

Life can never be exactly like we want it to be
I can be satisfied just knowing that you love me
There's one thing I want you to do, especially for me
And it's something everybody needs, hey

Each night before you go to bed, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

My life can never be exactly like we want it to be
I can be satisfied just knowing that you love me
There's one thing I want you to do, especially for me
And it's something everybody needs, ooh

Each night before you go to bed, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
