This is dedicated to the one I love

While I'm away from you, my baby
I know it's hard for you, my baby
Because it's hard for me, my baby
But the darkest hour is just before day


Each night before you go to bed, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby
And let's tell all those stars above
That this is dedicated to the one I love

Life can never be exactly
Like we want it to be
But I can be satisfied
Just knowing you love me

But there's one thing I want
You to do especially for me
And it's something that everybody needs



This is dedicated to the one I love
