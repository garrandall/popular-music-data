I feel like I've been blown apart, there are pieces here
I don't know where they go, I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips, I bet you feel a little crazy
But for me, we'll be famous on TV


Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it


I jump on you, you jump on me, you push me out
And even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth
When I kiss your salty lips, you will feel a little crazy
But for me, I'll be famous on TV


Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it


Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it


Now, will it be my fault if I take your love and throw it wide?
You might restrain me but could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart, all the pieces there will fit
To make you whole and I know where they go


Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it


When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down
Don't want to waste it
