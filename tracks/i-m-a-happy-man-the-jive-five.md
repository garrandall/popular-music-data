I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my baby
You look so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my baby
Just like I knew you would
Tonight when we go out
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm feelin' so proud
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Walking hand in hand
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Down the lovers lane
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
And I-I-I love you, baby
I love you so
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my baby
This you know
'Cause I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Yeah, baby, I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Whoa, yeah
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Come on down and sing the song
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Sing it just-a one more time
(Happy man, happy man)
And when we take a stroll
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Tonight if it's cold
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
We'll cuddle up close
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
And baby, baby, baby
I'll kiss you baby
We'll be as one
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I love my baby
We'll have some fun
'Cause I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Yeah, baby, I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Whoooooa, yeah
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Come on down and sing the song
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Sing it just-a one more time
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
Whoooooa, yeah
(Happy man, happy man, happy man)
I'm a happy man
