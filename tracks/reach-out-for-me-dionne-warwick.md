When you go through a day
And the things that people say
They make you feel so small
They make you feel that
Your heart will just never stop aching
And when you just can't accept 
The abuse you are taking
Darlin' reach out for me

Don't you worry I'll see you through
You just have to reach out for me
I'll be there and I'll confort you
Oh yes I will
Comfort you and love you
How I'm gonna love you

When good friends prove untrue
And the things they do to you
They make you feel so bad
They make you feel that
You haven't a reason for living
So when you feel you
Could throw in the towel and just given in
Darlin' reach out for me
