Well the weatherman said it might storm today
I gotta hit the field
Gotta bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddy's farm
Til I get it all stacked up high in the barn

And I'm gonna call my baby
She's been waiting on me
She lives down town on Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the black top
A startin' to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign

I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too

I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Well her Daddy said child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sire don't like me
Momma just says ya'll have a little fun
Ain't doin' nothing me and papa ain't done
Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss
As I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too

I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Yeah it's true I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
Cause that's when country comes to town
Here I come
