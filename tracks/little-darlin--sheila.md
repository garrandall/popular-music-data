Would you know me in a passing crowd
Lonely faces that once gripped eyes
From the moment that I caught your eye
I felt my loneliness fly
Tell me, would you know me?
Show me, There's no need to be afraid


Oh little darling
Would you love me forever?
Oh little darling
Would you love me forever?
Oh little darling
Never leave me, no never
Oh little darling
Would you love me forever?

You know it's empty out on the street
Now there is magic where we used to meet
A year ago I didn't know your name
'Cause I was out there playing silly games
Hold me for a moment
I'm here with you
And everything just disappears
