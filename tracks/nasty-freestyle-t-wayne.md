First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche


First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
Her man a bit lit like a muh fuckin' torch
And I don't want it if it ain't sittin' like a horse
I be ballin', I be ballin' like score
I'm sippin' lean and I can feel it in my body
I'ma pull up on 'em like I'm Ricky Bobby
I swear that I don't want your girl if she ain't cocky
I ain't got no kids but she still call me papi
I got attitude, I got gratitude
And like my mixtape, I got your girl comin' soon
I been throwed off since I came out of the womb
My flow ten times hotter than the month of June
But you can have it, baby, I got 'em goin' crazy
New paper flow, I'm gettin' paper on the daily
And a chick got a plaque so I know they hate me
But guess what? First, let me hop out the muh fuckin


First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche


First, let me hop out the all white Turbo
My Vans all red like a glass of the Merlot
Wax on the joint make the muh fucka burn slow
Every day I wake up, I get 25 pre-rolls
Tinted the windows, I bought Forgiattos, I feel like the shit
Got my seat real low, real nigga shit
My 911 left your Panamera
Your Carrera in my rearview mirror
Two hundred bands, you can drive one of these
Only fuck with gangsters and strippers, no Yeez
Pull up on your girl, bet she gon' hop in
I turn up the music, got her head bobbin'
Holdin' the peace, girl this shit is not a lease
Dolla $ign a beast, hundred K centerpiece
Bombay and Hennessy, that's all my niggas drink
I told her, first, let me hop out the muh fuckin'


First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche


First let me hop out the all-black Pan'
Touch down on a nigga just like Manning
Middle finger up to these niggas, can't stand me
Trapper of the year, bitch give me a Grammy
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the rims on that bitch
Just hopped out the Porsche, look at the paint on that bitch
I'm just drainin' these hoes like a faucet
I'm just hangin' these niggas in my closet
I'm stackin' up the money like government cheese
10 bands on some fresh new Louis
Spendin' up the money like it came from overseas
Porsche Cayenne, I done bought my girl 3
She puttin' that ass on me like a horsey
Turned around and said, "Nigga you can't afford me"
I looked right back at her and I said to her
"First let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche"


First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
