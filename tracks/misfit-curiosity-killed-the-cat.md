Sensitive child
Keep running wild
In a confined space
But you're not to blame
'Cause you're not the same
Get on the case

Crazy sheep, you are the odd one out
Crazy sheep, let them know what you're all about

Misfit
Freak that's on the street
Well I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long? How low? How high can you go? 
There'll be a bind for every kind
You'll see

Sensitive child
Your threat is so mild
It worries me
Build yourself some protection
To avoid the injection
Then you can be happy

Crazy sheep you are the odd on out
Crazy sheep let them know what you're all about

Misfit
Freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long? How low? How high can you go? 
There'll be a bind for every kind
You'll see

Set your mode to emotion
Your secret potion
Designed to satisfy your soul
And underneath
Your broken dreams
You need to satisfy your soul

Misfit
Freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long? How low? How high can you go? 
There'll be a bind for every kind
You'll see

Too fat, too thin, you lose or you win
This may come as some surprise
Too tall, too short, too loose or too taut
There'll be a bind for every kind

Misfit
Freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long? How low? How high can you go? 

Too fat, too thin, you lose or you win
This may come as some surprise
Too tall, too short, too loose or too taut
There'll be a bind for every kind...
