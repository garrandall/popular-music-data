Want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I wanna know
If what you feel is real, girl
Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say, what I talk about
But oh, I want to love you girl
In a special way, come here woman
We've been together
For so very long
I'd hate to break up
Break up my happy home


(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
Girl, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
There's a time
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
Makes me feel, it's worth a try
(I'll be good to you)


Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you


Girl you said, we've been together
So very long, very long
I would hate to break up
Break up my happy home
Let me take off your shoes
Take a stand, now
And let me know how
Oh always baby, and all your know-how


(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
The way we cry
(Of all these things, there lies a time)
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)




Girl, I'll be good to you, babe
Y'know I'll be good to you, take you shopping
You know what I mean baby? Anything you want
I'll be good to you
I'll give it up, with my credit cards
Like Visa, Master Charge, American Express
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week


Oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love
Talk to me
