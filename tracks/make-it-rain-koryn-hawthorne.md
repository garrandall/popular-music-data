The atmosphere is changing
Nothing stays the same
Heaven is waiting
For the mention of the Name
The Spirit is moving
Burning like a flame
Healing the broken
By the One we proclaim

Raise it up
Fill the sky
Chains will fall
Mountains move
We lift Him high

Speak the Name
The Name above all other names
Speak the Name
The Name the wind and waves obey
All of heaven's coming down
Fill the earth with a sound
Of the Name
The Name of Jesus

Gather all who wonder
Hostages of shame
Miracles unfolding
At the mention of the name
Our darkness is fleeing
Mercy raining down
Healing waters flowing
As our lips make the sound

Raise it up
Fill the sky
Chains will fall
Mountains move
We lift Him high

Speak the Name
The Name above all other names
Speak the Name
The Name the wind and waves obey
All of heaven's coming down
Fill the earth with a sound
Of the Name
The Name of Jesus
Speak the Name
The Name of Jesus

Strongholds are broken
I've been made free
I am forgiven
Fear has to leave
Strongholds are broken
I've been made free
I am forgiven
Fear has to leave
Your Name is healing
Your Name is power
Your Name is holy
My strong, strong tower
Wonderful Name
Glorious Name
Powerful Name of Jesus
Jesus

Speak the Name
The Name above all other names
Speak the Name
The Name the wind and waves obey
All of heaven's coming down
Fill the earth with a sound
Of the Name
The Name of Jesus
Of the Name
The Name of Jesus
Speak the Name
The Name of Jesus
