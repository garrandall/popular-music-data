Look somewhere above her
Pretend you don't love her
Pretend you don't see her at all

Pretend you don't see her, my heart
Although she is coming our way
Pretend you don't need her, my heart
But smile and pretend to be gay

It's too late for running, my heart
Chin up if a tear starts to fall
Look somewhere above her
Pretend you don't love her
Pretend you don't see her at all

Pretend you don't see her, my heart
Although she is coming our way
Pretend you don't need her, my heart
But smile and pretend to be gay

It's too late for running, my heart
Chin up if a tear starts to fall
Look somewhere above her
Pretend you don't love her
Pretend you don't see her at all
