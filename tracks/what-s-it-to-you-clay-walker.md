What's that
I hear angels singin'
Telling me to make my move
Listen to it
Their voices ringin' baby
If you feel it get in the groove

Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you

Time's up
Train's a leavin' baby
Are you ready to take that ride
Get on board
Don't keep my waiting baby
Say you're willin to cross that line

Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you

I'm sure your heart is telling you true
I gotta know what love is to you
'Cause to me it's the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what your feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you

Love is the rhythm of two hearts beating
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling
I know what love is
What's it to you

I know what love is what's it to you
