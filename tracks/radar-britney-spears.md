Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges (I like 'em rough)
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (know)

I'm checking it so hot (so hot)
I Wonder if he knows he's on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
And if I notice you I know it's you. Choose you don't wanna lose you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)

When you walk (when you walk) and when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader.. try to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can't handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan..

I don't think you know (know)

I'm checking it so hot (so hot)
Wonder if he knows he's on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
And if I notice you I know it's you
Choose you don't wanna lose you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
When you walk (when you walk) and when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader.. try to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
on my radar (on my radar)

on my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR
on my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR

I got my eye on you... and I can't let you get away...

Hey baby whether it's now or later (I've got you)
you can't shake me (no)
cause I got you on my radar
Whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
cause I got you on my radar (I've got you)
cause I got you on my radar

I'm checking it so hot (so hot)
Wonder if he knows he's on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
And if I notice you I know it's you. Choose you don't wanna lose you're on my radar (on my radar) on my radar (on my radar)
When you walk (when you walk) and when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader... try to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
on my radar (on my radar)
on my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR
on my radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) radar (got you on my) RADAR

Da-da-da-da-da-da-dadadadadadada... da da da.
Da-da-da-da-da-da-dadadadadadada... da da da da da da da
