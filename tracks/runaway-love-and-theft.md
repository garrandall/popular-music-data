It's been a long week
I've got a slow leak in my left front tire
I'm sick of where I work
My boss is such a jerk, don't care if I get fired

My back's about to break
No money in the bank
And she don't call me anymore
I'm down to my last drink, it's time to sell my things

And pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my getaway

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight
At the break of day
I'll be a runaway

A hundred miles in, I got a stupid grin
On my scruffy face
With every cigarette I'm burnin' my regrets
Don't want to leave a trace

And from the rearview, I've got clear view
Of who I used to be
A little bit faster now
Ddon't wanna turn around

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my getaway

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight
And at the break of day
I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)

It's crazy, I know, to count on this road
To give me what I need
But with every state line
Somehow I find another part of me, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my get away

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight
And at the break of day
I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)
