When your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
Come on over here and lay by my side
I've got to be touchin' you
Let me rub your tired shoulders
The way I used to do
Look into my eyes and give me that smile
The one that always turns me on
And let me take your hair down
'Cause we're stayin' up to greet the sun
And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
Got to say a few things that have been on my mind
And you know where my mind has been
I guess I learned my lessons
And now's the time to begin
So if you're feelin alright and you're ready for me
I know that I'm ready for you
We better get it on now
'Cause we got a whole life to live through
And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
