We were 18, it was prom night
We had our first big fight
She said "Pull this car over"
I did and then I told her, "I don't know what you are crying for"
I grabbed her hand, as she reached for the door

She said, I'll walk
Let go of my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and you don't understand
So just be quiet
And later we will talk
Just leave, don't worry. I'll walk

It was a dark night, a black dress
Driver never saw her, around the bend
I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital
When they said her legs still wouldn't move
I cried, when I walked into her room

She said, I'll walk
Please come and hold my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand
Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk
Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk

I held her hand through everything
The weeks and months of therapy
And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride
She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle
So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles

And says, I'll walk
Please hold my hand
I know that this will hurt, I know you understand
Please daddy don't cry
This is already hard
Let's go, don't worry
I'll walk
