I was born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on living
Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be


The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor


I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be


The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor


Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stop
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must have had my mamma's will and God's
Amazing grace


I'm a survivor
