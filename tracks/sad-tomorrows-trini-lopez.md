I don't want no sad tomorrows
I've had my share of heartache and sorrow
Please go away, end it today
I'll only be hurt if you stay, if you stay

When lovers part, it's a sad day
The sun grows cold, the sky turns grey
This is goodbye, I try not to cry
But this????? deep inside, deep inside

I know that I
Will have to forget all about you
And I must try
'Cause I know that you'll break my heart

I don't want no sad tomorrows
I've had my share of heartache and sorrow
Please go away, end it today
I'll only be hurt if you stay, if you stay

Please go away, end it today
Please go away, hear what I say
Please go away
