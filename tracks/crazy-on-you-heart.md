If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the Devil and the kids keep coming
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young


But I tell myself that I was doing all right
There's nothing left to do at night


But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh


My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight


And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine


Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh


Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?


Ah
Oh crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you


I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love


Crazy, yeah
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah

Ah
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
