The other night
As I lay sleeping
Whoa, I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
But when I woke up this morning
Found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I
Hung my head and cried
Whoa, you are my sunshine
(You are my sunshine)
Whoa, my only sunshine
(My only sunshine)
Whoa, you make me happy
(You make me happy)
When my skies are gray
(When skies are gray)
You'll never, never know
(You'll never know)
How much I love you
(How much I love you)
Whoa, and I don't want you to take
(Don't take my sunshine)
My sunshine away (shine away)
Told me once, dear
That you really loved me
And no one else
Could ever come between, yeah
Now you've left me
And you love another, yeah
And you have shattered

Oh, yeah, all of my dreams
Whoa, you are my sunshine
(You are my sunshine)
Whoa, my only sunshine
(My only sunshine)
Whoa, you make me happy
(You make me happy)
When the skies are gray
(When skies are gray)
You'll never, never know
(You'll never know)
How much I love you
(How much I love you)
Whoa, I don't want you to take
(Don't take my sunshine)
If you love me
(Don't take my sunshine)
If you need me
(Don't take my sunshine)
If you want me
(Don't take my sunshine)
(Don't take my sunshine)
I don't want you to take
(Don't take my sunshine)
Whoa, oh, yes, sir
(Don't take my sunshine)
Don't you take
(Don't take my sunshine)
My sunshine away (shine away)
