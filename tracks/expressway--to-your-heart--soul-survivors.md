I been trying to get to you for a long time.
'Cause constantly you been on my mind.
I was thinkin' about a short cut I could take.
But it seems like I made a mistake.

Well, I was wrong.
Ooo, took too long.
I got caught in the rush hour.
An' fellows started to shower
You with love and affection.
Now you won't look at my direction.
On the expressway to your heart.
That expressway's not the best way.

At five o'clock,
It's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
No, it's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
So-oh crowded. (Too crowded.)
It's much too crowded, oh yeah. (Crowded.)
So, so, so crowded. (Oh, too crowded.)

a-There's too many ahead of me,
They all try to get in front of me.
I thought that I could drive a clear road ahead,
But I found stoplights instead.

I was wrong.
Babe, it took too long.
I got caught in the rush hour.
An' fellows started to shower
You with love and affection.
C'mon look at my direction.
On the expressway to your heart.
That expressway's not the best way.

At five o'clock,
It's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
Much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
So-oh crowded. (Too crowded.)
So move me, oh yeah. (Crowded.)
