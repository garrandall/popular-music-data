I don't mind waitin' for you
It's what I really, really want to do
But you got me standin', waitin' all night
And baby, girl, it just ain't right

Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Girl, make up your mind
Before it's too late

I've been tryin' to get close to you
I can't believe the things you put me through
So tell me, baby, what's it gonna be?
Do I have to say goodbye or are you stayin' here with me?

Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Girl, make up your mind
Before it's too late

Girl, believe me
I'm tellin' you for the very last time
Don't hesitate, don't turn away
Don't make me wait, I just can't wait

Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Girl, make up your mind
Before it's too late

Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late

Come on, baby (Make up, make up your mind)
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late, late, late, late
(Make up, make up your mind)
(Make up, make up your mind)
Before it's too late
(Make up, make up your mind)
Make up your mind
(Make up, make up your mind)
(Make up, make up your mind)
