Woo!

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night

Oh slow ride
Oh

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Woo!

I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night

Oh

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Slow ride, easy, slow ride, sleazy
Slow ride, easy, slow ride, sleazy

Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine

Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy

Slow down
Go down
Slow down
Go down

Come on, baby
Take a slow ride with me
Come on, baby
Take a slow ride

Oh, feel good
Mmm, feels so good
I like it, yeah
I feel good
Oh, I feel all right

You know the rhythm is right
You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
We've got to rock all night

You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
You know the rhythm is right
Woah, come all night

Slow ride!
