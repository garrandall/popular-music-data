Ay, big ole freak
Big booty, big ole treat
Imma make him wait for the pussy
Hit it til you big ole skeet
Feet on the bed
I'll fuck him up in the head
Suck it then look in his eyes
Then the next day I might leave em read

Pop it, pop it
Daydreaming bout how I rock it
He hit my phone with a horse
So I know that mean come over and ride it
Shid, I'm on the way
Ride on that dick I'm like yay
Usually I like to fuck
But tonight we gone make love cause you bae
Nobody know, I fuck with him on the low
We never show up together but I text him when I'm ready to go
Ay, I had a couple of shots at the bar
I'm finna play with that dick in the car
I got him swerving and breaking the law
These windows tinted so nobody saw

Ain't nobody freak like me
Give ya what you need like me
Ain't nobody got on they tip, tip toes and rode to the tip like me
Got em addicted, he feigning
My body a drug and he need it
He begging me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave em

He like
"Baby lemme rub, lemme rub on ya
Want a lil love, lil love from ya"
My body addictive it's driving him crazy
Think I got run from ya
Don't know what to do without it
He fucking with you, I doubt it
They don't understand, I'm all in his head
Ain't nothing to do about it

You been feigning for me lately
Going brazy, brazy
I got what you need I'mma give it to you baby
Going brazy, brazy
Feigning for me lately
I got what you need
I'mma give you what you craving

See I'm a big ole freak, I love to talk my shit
And you must be a pussy boy, if you get offended
Bitch it's Tina Snow, they love me cause I'm cold
You can't take no nigga from me
I got mind control
I want to fuck in the mirror, I like to look at your face when you in it
Come in the room and I'm giving commands
I am the captain and he the lieutenant
I need that neck like a motherfucking pendant
Need you to spit, make that motherfucker glisten
Tell him "Shut up!" make that motherfucker listen
I bet he gone like it, won't do no tripping

Ain't nobody freak like me (Hell nah)
Give ya what you need like me (Hell nah)
Ain't nobody got on they tip, tip toes and rode to the tip like me (Huh)
Got em addicted, he feigning
My body a drug and he need it
He begging me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave em

He like
"Baby lemme rub, lemme rub on ya
Need a lil love, lil love from ya"
My body addictive it's driving him crazy
Think I got run from ya
Don't know what to do without it
He fucking with you, I doubt it
They don't understand, I'm all in his head
Ain't nothing to do about it

You been feigning for me lately
Going brazy, brazy
I got what you need I'mma give it to you baby
Going brazy, brazy
Feigning for me lately
I got what you need
I'mma give you what you craving
