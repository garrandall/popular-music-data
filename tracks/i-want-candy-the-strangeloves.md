I want candy
I want candy
(You know what I want)
I want candy
(Let's go)

I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
She's got everything that I desire
Sets summer sun on fire
Let's go, yeah

You know what I want now
You know what I want now
You know what I want now
Come on

I want candy
(That's what I want man)
(That's what I want)
I want candy
(I gotta have it)
I want candy
(It's what I want)
(It's what I want)
I want candy

So now off to see her when the sun goes down
Cause there ain't no finer girl in town
She got the plans, what the doctor ordered
(Oh, you know)
Baby girl, you're so sweet
You make my mouth water
(Yeah, oh yeah)

Come on
You know what I want now
You know what I want now
You know what I want now
Come on

I want candy
(That's what I want man)
(That's what I want)
I want candy
(I gotta have it)
I want candy
(It's what I want)
(It's what I want)
I want candy

C-A-N-D-Y
Say I want candy
(I want candy)

It's the only thing I want
It's the only thing I need
So give it to me please eeh

Candy on the beach there's nothing better
But I like the candy all wrapped in a sweater
Someday soon I'll make you mine
And then I'll have candy all the time
Uuuh whoa

I want candy
(That's what I want man)
(That's what I want)
I want candy
(Give it to me now, baby, yeah)
I want candy
(I can't wait no more, baby, yeah)
I want candy

I want candy
(Sing it with me now, baby)
I want candy
(I want candy)
(I want candy)
I want candy
(I said I'd even need the wrapper)
I want candy
