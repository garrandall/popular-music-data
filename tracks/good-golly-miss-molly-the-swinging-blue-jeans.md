Good golly Miss Molly
Yeah you sure like to ball
Oh good golly Miss Molly
Yeah you sure like to ball
When you're shaking and shouting
Can you hear your mama call

From the early, early morning
Till the early, early night
Molly's gonna rocking at the house of blue lights

Good golly Miss Molly
Yeah you sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can you hear your mama call

Well now mama, papa told me:
'Son you better watch your step'
What I knew about Miss Molly
Got to watch my dad myself

Oh good golly Miss Molly
Yeah you sure like to ball
When you're shaking and shouting
Can you hear your mama call

From the early early morning
Till the early early night
Molly's gonna rocking at the house of blue lights

Good golly Miss Molly
Yeah you sure like to ball
And when you're rocking and rolling
Can you hear your mama call

Oh good golly Miss Molly
Oh good golly Miss Molly
Oh good golly Miss Molly
When you're shaking and shouting
Can you hear your mama call
