Every time you touch me I get high
And every time you're near me I can fly
High above the clouds and rain way above the hurt and pain
And when you're gone I fall down from the sky

But every time you touch me I get high
I've been touched by the angels and I've been kissed by the very best
And I've been loved hard by quit a few
But after you I forget the rest

Cause every time you touch me I get high
And every time you're near me I can fly
When your fingers touch my skin that's when I start to live again
Cause without your love I'd lay right down and die

Every time you touch me I get high
