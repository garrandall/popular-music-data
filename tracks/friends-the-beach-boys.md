We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give


We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night I get a call and I know that you're well
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair


We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
