Stunnaman
D-Game
All this money never running out
These pussy niggas just run they mouth
All this money never running out
Like, I say


Last month, spent a 100 thous'
In a new foreign, goin' 100 miles (Foreign)
All this money never running out
Them pussy niggas just run they mouth (Pussy)
That is truth really coming out
I can see the hate when you come around (I can)
Acting like he don't know me now
And only fuck with me when he in the town (Uh-uh)
Bouncin' out with a new cannon
'Bout to leave a nigga on a newspaper (Ayy, do that)
Nigga ran off with a bird
Didn't think I'd catch up with you later? (It's Philthy, ho)
A hundred hundreds, that's ten thou' (Is that right?)
Two hundred fifties, that's ten thou' (Is that right?)
Five hundred twenties, that's ten thou' (Is that right?)
A lot of Ps that I shipped out (It's Phil)
See, I don't need the whole 30-clip, boy
I can get it down 10 of 'em (With ten of 'em)
He talkin' 'bout he wants 10 numbers (Ten numbers)
He pullin' up where I'm sellin' em (Ayy, pull up)
See all these foreigns, I ain't rented none
Them bad bitches, I'm sendin' 'em (Bitch)
That blue truck, he ain't never been in one (Uh-uh)
Boy, I couldn't wait 'til they invented one
It's Philthy

Whole thang came back thirty-six
I ain't got no extras (I ain't got no extras)
Ain't no more of this Hi-Tech left
I ain't got no extras (Syrup)
Thousand hundreds, two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras (Nuh-uh)
Hit the sto' for some rubber bands quick
I ain't got no extras (It's Phil)
Whole thang came back thirty-six
I ain't got no extras (I ain't got no extras)
Ain't no more of this Hi-Tech left
I ain't got no extras (Syrup)
Thousand hundreds, two fifties bitch
I ain't got no extras (Nuh-uh)
Hit the sto' for some rubber bands quick
I ain't got no extras (It's Phil)


I ain't got no extras (Nope)
I ain't got no extras (Uh-uh)
Brought a package up to the town
I'm always on schedule (Yeah)
Man, I spent my whole life
Sellin' dope forever (Yeah)
I ain't know no better (No)
I just wanted better (Yeah)
I want a better car (Yeah)
I want a bigger house (Yeah)
Want a badder bitch (What else?)
With a bigger mouth (Yeah)
And if she suck another dick
Then I'ma kick her out (I promise)
I just bought another stick so I can stick around (Yeah)
Pale niggas here to count my money (Yeah)
I get tired of countin' (Yeah)
The dope game don't come with accountants (Nope)
I get tired of sleepin' in the mountains (Yeah)
I get tired of lame niggas around me (Yeah)
I don't need nothin' else (Nope)

Hit the store for some rubber bands
Nigga got in town for a hundred bands
And the re-up be about a million dollar
Hit the strip club and the bitch holler
And the big bad become a real problem
And y'all niggas fake like a three-dollar
And them big chops a real problem
And that Benz truck make a bitch holler
When she see me she start seein' dollars
I'ma fuck once and she won't stop callin'
I'ma call the bitch, show her to my partners
Give 'em dumb head with a lot of slobber
And the bit they'll come with can't stumble
Whip dope, get a lot of extra
No need to count it, we straight stackin'
On a hundred pound, we'll stack a million

I am on point, ain't no extras
I do this shit with no effort (Right)
Young nigga, I'm a veteran
I'm ten toes down when there's pressure, nigga (Hey)
Livewire don't test me
Leave a fuck nigga on a stretcher (Gone)
He came through and grabbed everythang
I ain't hesitate 'cause I blessed 'em (Shit gone)
Might get a load then run thorugh it (Yeah)
Hella pos, gotta thumb through it
New money do somethin' to me
Ain't gotta move, the shit come to me (Ayy)
Shoes cost a quarter P, ayy (Ayy)
Whole fit, double G, ayy
He way on the other side of town
But he know come straight to me, ayy (Come on)
Whole hood know Paid, nigga
Came a long way from Ray's, nigga
Hoppin' out with them Ks, nigga (Bow-bow-bow)

Half a thang to a whole thirty-six
I ain't got no extras (No extras)
Pussy nigga talkin' 'bout that and this
But it ain't no pressure (What?)
Tell the ho take the bands at my wrist
Nigga coulda bought Tesla
All the pretty snowbunnies on my dick
I feel like Hugh Hefner (Oh Lord)
Last month I made a half a mil'
It's kinda hard to think about a record deal
Money think a nigga major, still
Gotta thank the plug and the vacuum seal
Gotta keep a tool in the battlefield
All my niggas gon' drill somethin'
The opps say they gonna kill me at my show
But a nigga still comin'
I know they mad that we made it (Made it)
No extra help, our pace
Bricks white like Katie (White)
Ps throw like Brady, ooh
I see the shades, you shady (Shady)
But I'ma stay stunin' like Baby (Baby)
Save the talk for your bitch, nigga (Nigga)
We ain't rich, we filthy, nigga (Yeah)
