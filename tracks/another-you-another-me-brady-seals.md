Is it any wonder
I hold you so tight
It's because we're never promised
One more day or night

Remember there will never be
Another you, another me
Another life for us to live
To give each other all we give

Time goes by so fast
I want to make each moment last
I want to hold you close to me
And show you all our love can be

I won't let go too easily
There will never be another you and me

I know love can hurt us
And love can make us fly
I know I was born to love you
Till the day I die

Believe me there will never be
Another you, another me
Another life for us to live
To give each other all we give

Time goes by so fast
I want to make each moment last
I want to hold you close to me
And show you all our love can be

I won't let go too easily
There will never be another you and me, no

There will never be
Another you, another me
Another life for us to live
To give each other all we give

Time goes by so fast
I want to make each moment last
I want to hold you close to me
And show you all our love can be

I won't let go too easily
There will never be another you and me
