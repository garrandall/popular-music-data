Broken hearted since we parted
I don't go nowhere, but what do I care
I'm just broken hearted since we parted


I'm so blue, baby, without you
Yes, I don't have no one, ain't been havin no fun
Since you been gone, I can't go on
I keep on cryin', my hope keeps dyin'
Oh, I'm broken hearted, baby since we parted


Maybe you don't know it, girl
So let me just remind you
That I still love you, girl
And I'm gonna find you
But until, I hope that you
Will leave the past behind you
And come on and let me know
That you've been so


Broken hearted, ohsince we parted
Just say you will give me a thrill
Come on, come on home
Nevermore to roam
I'm so broken hearted, baby, since we parted


I don't have no one
I ain't havin' no fun
'Cause I need you
You bet your life
You bet your life I do
So come on, come on, come on
