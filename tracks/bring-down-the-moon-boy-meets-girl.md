Oh!
Tha Bizzness


Let Me Set The Mood Right
Slow It Down, Yellow Light
Said The Party Don't Start Until The Moon Rise
Got A Table In The Club, Full Size
I Could Get You Wet & Take A Nose Dive
Cool Shades, Polarized
Tryna Get You High In The Solar System
Kid Ink Baby You Ain't Know Him Bitch Better Get It Right
But You Ain't Got To Get In Line
Lookin' Like A Play Boy Bunny Hope You Energized
Gon & Take A Minute & Decide
I Ain't Thinkin' Bout It
I'ma Make You Mine


By The End Of The Night
We Gon Have Some Fun 
Cuz Help Me Throw These Ones
In The Air, To The Lights
By The End Of The Night
I'ma Get You High
Puffin' On That Loud
Girl, I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night
I'ma Get You Right


(Now It's Dorrough Music)
I Hope 2:35 A.M Ain't Too Late (Too Late)
Let's Go & Get A Hotel Just Cuz You Gotta Roommate
(Say Girl)
When You Go Winter Time, Tie Me Down Like A Shoelace
I'ma Beat That Like It Owe Me, Today I'm Past Due Date
(Yeah Buddy)
I'ma Have You Right By The End Of The Night (Night, Night)
MÃ©nage Ã  trois With Any Friend You Invite
(Just Playin)
Just Make That Pussy Pop Like Its A Can Full Of Sprite
And Take A Couple Hits Whenever I Hand You The Pipe
Get It?
Pretty Face, Thin Waist With A Fat Ass
Cali Based, London Graced And You Stack Cash
Even Though I Ain't Headed I Want It That Bad (I Do)
We Gon Both Be Like Satisfaction At Last
Ha, So When You See My Number Pop Up (Lil' Mama)
That Mean I'm Standing Outside The Do' & I'm Rocked Up (Oh!)
Don't Worry Bout The Rubbers, Girl I'm Stocked Up (Bring Magnums)
And Only Time Gon' Stop Us


By The End Of The Night (Night)
We Gon Have Some Fun (Yeah)
Cuz Help Me Throw These Ones (Ones)
In The Air, To The Lights (Lights)
By The End Of The Night (Night)
I'ma Get You High (High)
Puffin' On That Loud (Ha)
Girl, I'ma Get You Right (Aye!)
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right


Girl It's Getting Late 
It's Yo Last Call
Been Waiting All Night
To Take Yo Heels Off (C'mon)
Meet Me At Valet (Yup)
Follow Back Home
Bring A Couple Friends
You Ain't gotta Come Alone
We Gon Have A Party (Party)
Later I'ma Make You Call Me Daddy Like Maury
Run My Fingers Down Yo Body Like A Guitarist
Got Me Hooked, Chorus
Why You Bullshittin' Like A Taurus


By The End Of The Night (Night)
We Gon Have Some Fun (Yeah)
Cuz Help Me Throw These Ones (Ones)
In The Air, To The Lights (Lights)
By The End Of The Night (Night)
I'ma Get You High (High)
Puffin' On That Loud (Ha)
Girl, I'ma Get You Right (Aye!)
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
By The End Of The Night (Aye!)
I'ma Get You Right
