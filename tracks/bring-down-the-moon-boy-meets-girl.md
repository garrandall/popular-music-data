I'm walking in darkness
With no shadows
Tears fall in silence
With no sound
I've got to let go
Of visions I've outgrown
Even I know but it hurts
So let the rain come down

Bring down the moon
The mythic and mighty that fall when you lean
Bring down the moon
Building love on thin air and dreams
Perfect love is a desperate creed
And one that we all try to believe
So bring down the moon

I'm finding some comfort
In closing the distance
Between my life and my dreams
If love's not forever
I need to discover
The spirit of romance and magic
In living from day to day

Perfect love has no guarantee
Still we keep trying to believe
So bring down the moon

Well there's no guarantee
That there ever will be perfect love
So let the rain come down
I know that it hurts
Coz I used to believe I know how it hurts
