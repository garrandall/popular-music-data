Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

Little Miss Lonely sitting forlornly
Looks through her window, clouds hide the sun
She thinks of her love, gone like the wild dove
She knows he'll never return

Grim Reaper of Love
Grim Reaper of Love (Strikes again)
Grim Reaper of Love
Grim Reaper of Love
Killing the living and living to kill
The Grim Reaper of Love thrives on pain
People, beware

Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

Mister Sad thinks of the loss of his love
Reflecting his past, thinking love can't last
He was so happy, peaceful and carefree
Now his life is lived as hers

Grim Reaper of Love
Grim Reaper of Love (Strikes again)
Grim Reaper of Love
Grim Reaper of Love
Killing the living and living to kill
The Grim Reaper of Love thrives on pain
People, beware

Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
