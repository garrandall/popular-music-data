Everyday, it's getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.
Everyday, seems a little faster, all my friends, they say go on up and ask her.
A love like yours would surely come my way.

Everyday it seems a little stronger, everyday it lasts a little longer.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?
Everyday seems a little closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.
A love like yours would surely come my way, everyday.

Everyday it seems a little stronger, everyday it lasts a little longer.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me? Like I long from you baby.
Everyday seems a little closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.
