His name was Steve, her name was Gina
They met at a bar called the Cabo Wabo Cantina
He was an insurance salesman from South Dakota
She was a first grade school teacher Phoenix, Arizona
They started dancing and it got real hot
Then it spilled over into the parking lot
One more tequila they were falling in love
One more's never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico

He woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
To check on his wife and his kids back at home, in Sioux Falls
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy, heavy mind
He knew it was the first time Gina'd ever crossed that line
They walked down to the beach and started drinking again
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim
One more margarita they were falling in love
One more's never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh, Mexico

Waiting at the bar in the terminal gate
She says, "Steve I've got to go, I'm gonna miss my plane."
He said, "One more tequila before you climb on up."
She said, "One more's never enough."

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico

Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh, Mexico
