Turn my vocals up, alright

I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody finding theirself
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up I'm feeling the same

I got issues just like you got issues
I been hurt I seen scar tissue
If I showed you would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?

Do I even need you?
Should I leave you?
Do I gotta be you
Just to please you?
Do I say I'm all good
When I bleed you through my heart?
Quit tearing mine apart


I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best


Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is aboutâaight, check this out

Look, life is about making mistakes
It's also about trying to be great, right
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us,
I can speak about 'cause I did it true
Ladies and gentlemen here's the exhibit
It's my life look a little closer you could see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em

Look at all the years
I've been waiting for a moment
Shed a lot of tears
Just to smile in the morning
Tell me could you love me,
Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you why?


I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best


This song's for anybody, yeah
Who feels like I did
Never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through
Always remain true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it
The one's who dreaming and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song


I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I swear I do
I fall, yeah, I break, yeah, I mess up, I make mistakes
And I ain't sorry 'bout it
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best


Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it going, gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about
