I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it, Peg.

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg
It will come back to you
Peg
It will come back to you

Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg
It will come back to you
Peg
It will come back to you

Then the shutter falls
You see all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie

Then the shutter falls
You see all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie

Then the shutter falls
You see all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie
