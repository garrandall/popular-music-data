Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
Hey little sister, who's the Superman?
Hey little sister, who's the one you want?
Hey little sister, shotgun!

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

Hey little sister, who is it you're with? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, what's your vice or wish? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, shotgun, oh yeah
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, shotgun!

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, ow!

"Pick it up!
Take me back home, yeah!"

Hey little sister, what have you done? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, who's the only one? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've been away for so long (So long)
I've been away for so long (So long)
I let you go for so long
It's a nice day to start again
C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, ow!
There is nothing fair in this world, baby
There is nothing safe in this world
And there's nothing sure in this world
And there's nothing pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again
C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding, wow!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
