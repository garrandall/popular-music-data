Well, she's a hum, hum, humdinger
She's a hum, hum, humdinger
A quantity right, a quality plus
She's a hum, hum, humdinger
She's a humdinging witty kitty
California city kitty
Swell of a belle of a girl
Cause she's a heartbreaker
Yeah, she's a heartbreaker
Her personality's sweet
Knock you right off your feet
She's a heartbreaker
She's a heartbreaking witty kitty
California city kitty
Swell of a belle of a girl
Well, now anyone can see
This one's a sweet property easily
I might upset your cart
Go on and eat out your heart
Cause she belongs to me
My little bell ringer
My little bell ringer
As cool as peppermint ice
Get the shoes and the rice
My wedding bell ringer
Yeah, she's my
Bell ringing witty kitty
California city kitty
Swell of a belle of a girl
Well, now anyone can see
This one's a sweet property easily
I might upset your cart
Go on and eat out your heart
Cause she belongs to me
My little bell ringer
My little bell ringer
As cool as peppermint ice
Get the shoes and the rice
My wedding bell ringer
Yeah, she's my
Bell ringing witty kitty
California city kitty
Swell of a belle of a girl
