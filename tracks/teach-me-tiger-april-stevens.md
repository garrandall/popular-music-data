Hi Tiger

Teach me tiger how to kiss you... wah wah wah wah wah
Show me tiger how to kiss you... wah wah wah wah wah
Take my lips, they belong to you...
But teach me first, teach me what to do...

Touch me tiger when I'm close to you wah wah wah wah wah
Help me tiger I don't know what to do wah wah wah wah wah
I know that you could love me to
But show me first, show me what to do
This is the first love, that I have ever known
What must I do to make you my very own.. ?

Teach me tiger how to tease you wah wah wah wah wah
Tiger, tiger I wanna squeeze you wah wah wah wah wah
All of my love I will give to you
But teach me TIGER... or I'll teach you

Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...
