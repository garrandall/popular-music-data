Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I get you off my mind
Oh, but I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my world a misty blue

Just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things we used to do
Then my whole world turns misty blue

I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried
But when I said I'm glad we're through
My heart knows I've lied

Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I get you off my mind
Oh, but I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my world a misty blue

Oh, but I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my world a misty blue...
