 Just ask the lonely


When you feel that need
To make it all alone,
Remember no one is thinking of,
Going alone

Just ask the lonely...
They know the hurt and pain,
Of losing a love, you can never regain

 Just ask the lonely
 Just ask the lonely

 The young and foolish laugh at love
 Woo-hoo
 So they run away...
 Woo-hoo hoo hoo
 Confident and sure that fate
 Woo-hoo
 Will bring another love their way

 Ah
 But ask the lonely...
 Ah
How vainly a heart can yearn,
 Ah
 For losing a love that will never return

 Just ask the lonely
 Just ask the lonely...
They'll tell you

 Oh, Woo-hoo hoo-hoo
Oh

 Ah
 They'll tell you a story of sadness,
 Ah
A story too hard to believe...
 Ah
 They'll tell you the loneliest one is me

 Just ask the lonely
 Just ask the lonely

 Ask me...
I'm the loneliest one you'll see

 Just ask the lonely
