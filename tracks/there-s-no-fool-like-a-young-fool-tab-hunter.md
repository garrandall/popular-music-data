There's no fool like a young fool
With a young heart full of pain
There's no fool like a young fool
When he falls in love in vain
I gave you my love, then pledged my heart,
I thought this was the start of a
Wonderful dream that you and I could always share
I didn't know that love could be a losing game of
Tears and misery, I didn't know the meaning of despair
There's no fool like a young fool
With a young heart full of pain
There's no fool like a young fool
When he falls in love in vain
You were my first and only love,
We vowed by stars above that you'd
Always be true and never long for someone new
But when I passed your house last night,
I looked inside your window and saw
There was somebody else and he was kissing you
There's no fool like a young fool
With a young heart full of pain
There's no fool like a young fool
When he falls in love in vain
