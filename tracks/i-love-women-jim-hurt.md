now things aint changed in alabamaor washington dc
special interest groups take care of each other and i take care of me
try to keep a low profile sometimes thats hard to do
especially when you know that uncle same is watching you

they checked your charger card and its getting hard to do anything they dont know about
they learned your habits you had corn beef and cabbage last night at your girlfriends house
and when we went upstairs i wondered as we walked up in her room
is this place bugged do you think my love they know all the things we do?

what you dont know what hurt you
what you cant see cant bite
what you dont hear will never make you mad
so dont go looking for me tonight

you got the watergate man and whoops iran sure caused a whole lotta fuss
poor martin luther j edgar hoovers gun made another liar
gary hart jim baker things are tough all over 
you better not kiss no other woman unless shes your grandmother
can you imagine somebody wathching everything you do
this is the usa where people get paid to watch people that are watching you

ah yes we have insider trading and computer dating but i never aint goin for that
aint no machine pickin out my cling cause it may not have all the facts
ive got my own taste and my own ways id rather not talk about
and my private life is my private life and they aint gonna find out

what you dont know wont hurt you
what you cant see cant bite
what you dont hear will never make you mad
so why go lookin for me tonight
