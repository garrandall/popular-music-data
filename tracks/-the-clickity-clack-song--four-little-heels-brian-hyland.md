(Clickety clack)

Two little girls came walking down the avenue
Two little girls who had nothing to do
One wore yellow and the other wore black
And four little heels went clickety clack

Me and my friend came walking down the avenue
Just like the girls we had nothing to do
So we both whistled but they wouldn't look back
And four little heels went clickety clack

(Clickety clack) what a pretty pair
Walking along with their noses in the air
(Clickety clack) and then to our surprise
They started to talk to two other guys

Now me and my friend are walking down the avenue.

Me and my friend still have nothing to do
Gone are the girls dressed in yellow and black.
And four little heels going clickety clack

(Clickety clack) we were pretty mad
Thinking of the fun that we could have had
(Clickety clack) and then to our surprise
They walked away from the two other guys

Now me and my friend are walking down the avenue
Me and my friend walking two by two
We've got the girls dressed in yellow and black
And four little heels going clickety clack

(Clickety clack)
(Clickety clack)
(Clickety clack)
And four little heels going clickety clack
