I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to wake up and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-na)
There has to be a better way
Sing it again a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me


'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)


All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh


'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
