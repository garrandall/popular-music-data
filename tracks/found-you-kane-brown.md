Driving down back roads, skippin' down traffic
And flippin' thru the radio, all I get is static
I don't mind the quiet, I guess I kind of like it
Better than nothing at all, than the sound of us cryin'

You said you didnt mean it but it's still in my head
I learned it's no easier, to forgive and forget
We thought it was forever, look at us now
Well I tried, and I lost more than I found

Sitting by the window, waiting for your headlights
Been two damn days since you said goodbye
I was feeling lonely, feeling like I made a mistake
Though I never I'd never forgive myself for your heart break

I said I didn't mean it but it's still in your head
I've learned it's no easier, to forgive and forget
We thought it was forever, look at us now
Well I tried, and I lost more than I found

Baby, you can't explain
No don't say anything
No, it's too late

You said you didn't mean it, I said I didn't mean it
I learned it's no easier, to forgive and forget
We thought it was forever, look at us now
Well I tried and I lost
Well I tried and I lost more than I found
