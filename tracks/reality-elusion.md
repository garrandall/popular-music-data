You know its funny how a woman 
Can get caught up in their imagination 
Like a movie or something 
And their mind take over having them actually think 
What is an elusion is a reality 
But I'm here to set the record straight honey, 
Girl ain't no woman gonna stake claim on my property, 
When they couldn't afford it in the first place! 

Oh girl I can't help it that my man is so fine 
I can tell you one thing he ain't thinkin' about your tired behind 
I know you wish you had him 
But you missed-out on that train 
I ain't upset at all sweetie 
I'm just tryin to explain 
That you can't go around and try to mess up a happy home 
You need to find a man of your own 
And leave my man alone 

Oh? ..This reminds me of things in the movies 
When the story's made-up in your head 
Like fatal attraction, inefficient, and misery 
I know about your history 
Girl you got wrong 

Oh girl, in your mind you're being mislead 
Cause every night my man is with me and he's sleepin in my bed 
You livin in a world of make-believe 
How many tricks you got up your sleeve 
I'm talking to you woman to woman 
And I'm tryin to make you see 
That ya can't go around and try to mess up a happy home 
You need to find a man of your own. 



You luck I'm a woman with class 
Cause if I was I get ghetto on you fast 
I refuse to step down to your level 
I'm not a kid in high school 
I'm not gonna act a fool 



You got it wrong in your mind 
He ain't gonin nowhere cause he's my man.
