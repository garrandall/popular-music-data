Picked up the phone
Dialed your number
Click
I can't forget
The way things used to be
Felt so good
Had me saying oh
You know it ain't always money
But don't it sound funny
Everyday is my day when I'm loving no one


Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel
When the phone rings and it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean I'm running outta love


Late at night
When there's no one around
I can feel the tingle in my hand
Felt so good
Had me saying uh
You know it ain't always money
But don't it sound funny
Everyday is my day when I'm loving no one


Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
(Was it made for me)
Cause of the pain I feel when the phone rings
And it ain't for me?
(It ain't for me)
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
(But I'ma go on)
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean
I'm running outta love
(Oh out of love)
Running outta love
(Oh out of love)


I remember love
I remember like it was yesterday
I remember love
Picked up the phone
Dialed your number
Click


Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel when the phone rings
And it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
(I'ma gonna go on)
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean


Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel
(Pain I feel, the pain was real)
When the phone rings and it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
(But I'ma go on)
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean


Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel
When the phone rings and it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
(7 days a week)
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean
I'm running outta love
I'm running outta love
(Oh out of love)
Running outta love
(Oh out of love)
