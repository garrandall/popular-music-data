There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you

There's something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
