I want a guy who's willing to drive
To Amarillo by morning to see the sunrise
In my eyes
The kind of man that gets carried away
By the look, by the smile he puts on my face
Every day

If you want to be the one I give my heart to
Ask yourself, what would George Strait do?

Then sing to me, like an old troubadour
Hold on like we're dancing, on the Texas Saunders floor
And never leave me wondering if your love is true
Boy ask yourself, what would George Strait do?

I know a cowboy's got to roam
Just carry my love with you baby when you go
'Til you come back home
'Cause you know from time to time
I'm the kind of girl who's got to go and got to fly
But I leave you with a smile

Give me love without end, I'll give it back to you
If you ask yourself, what would George Strait do?

Sing to me, like an old troubadour
Hold on like we're dancing, on the Texas Saunders floor
And never leave me wondering if your love is true
Boy ask yourself, what would George Strait do?

Yeah sing to me, like an old troubadour
Hold on like we're dancing, on the Texas Saunders floor
And never leave me wondering if your love is true
Boy ask yourself, what would George Strait do?
Boy ask yourself, what would George Strait do?
