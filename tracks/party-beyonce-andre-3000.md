You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night Oh Oh Oh Oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!


Set the scene, three thousand degrees
I ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for realo, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot, and none else really mean none to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fuckin' with me? Move on, ain't none to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, I'm the raw, off the rip
Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute
They fell in love with rap
Black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm lovin' you

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh ooh
