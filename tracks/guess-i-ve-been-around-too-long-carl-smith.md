Guess I've been around too long

There you go with somebody new
Here I sit, alone so blue
Still I can't stop loving you
Guess I've been around too long

Yes, it's true, I still care
Miss you so much, wish you were here
My arms are aching to hold you near
But I guess I've been around too long

My poor heart can't get over you
Makes no difference what I say or do

All my life I've loved only you
You can be faithful or be untrue
There'll never be anyone but you
Although I've been around too long

My poor heart can't get over you
Makes no difference what I say or do

All my life I've loved only you
You can be faithful or be untrue
There'll never be anyone but you
Although I've been around too long
(Do do do do do)
