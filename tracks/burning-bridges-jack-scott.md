Found some letters you wrote me this morning
They told of the love we once knew
Now they're gone I burned them to ashes
Don't want nothing to remind me of you
Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow
Sold the house we once planned together
Said goodbye to the folks we once knew
Then I moved to a far away city
Trying hard to forget about you
Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow
