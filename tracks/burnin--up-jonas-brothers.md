Called her for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
Felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Told you I made dinner plans
You and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well I'm done with awkward situation's empty, conversations

This is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true, I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

I'm hot
You're cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on
My toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Oo Ooh)
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine

When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Every thing's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that its forever
I just gotta let you know
I never want to let you go

Now I'm speechless, over the edge
I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
