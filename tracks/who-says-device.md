The Night is warm and my Body wrecked
And the Hair stands up on the back of my neck
Oh yeah it's in my Hand and we shouldn't stop
But before I took the last shot something in my Head went to...
It doesn't matter what you say
How can you hope to hide away
Weren't we looking for the same Thing?....

Who,who,who says it's not that easy to walk away from you
Who,who,who says it's not that easy to...walk away...from you

And if we take this Temporary tumble in the Dark
Don't reach for the Hammer,don't hit me in the Heart
Breathe deep like a Beast when you're rockin' my device
Set loose like an Animal... just another sacrifice
Then you ran wild through the Streets with your Wheels on Fire
And the last Thing you needed was to see me turn around
And say, 'no!'
It doesn't matter what you say
How can you hope to hide away
Weren't we looking for the same thing?...

Who,who,who says it's not that easy to walk away from you
Who,who,who,says it's not that easyto...walkaway...from you
(watch me walk...)
It doesn't matter what you say
How can you hope to hide away
Weren't we looking for the same thing?...

Who,who,who says it's not that easy to walk away from you
Who,who,who says it's not that easy to...walk away... from you...
