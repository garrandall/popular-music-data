Well, there's one thing
I'd like to rearrange
But after everything's already happened
And there's nothing left to change

They can take their advice
And use it all on themselves
Cause when all the talking stops
I want to have something else

I want to have a little faith
I want to know what a guy and a girl
Can do when they're dizzy
Cause they're just not
Spinning with this world

(CHORUS)
If we never meet again
If goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past
But our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again

Well there's one thing
That I'll never forget
It's the beauty of a friendship
That's not over yet

I know how just one smile
Can be planted like a seed
And I want to do that for somebody else
The way it was done for me

I want to have a little faith
There's something better
At the end of this path
But these memories get old
And fade like photographs

(CHORUS)

Well, there's one thing I'd like to even up
You can be what they've made you into
Or you can make your own luck

You can't blindly fight your enemies
You can't blindly follow your friends
I've seen it happen so many times
I know it's gonna happen again

But I gotta have faith
I gotta know that a guy and a girl
Can still make it even when they're
Just not spinning with this world

If we never meet again
If goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past
But our bond remains unbroken

(CHORUS)
