Mrs. Bluebird, on my shoulder
How's  your life since you've gotten older?
How's  Mr. Bluebird? Is he well?
Keepin' warm through the cold spell




Mr. Bluebird, I have told her
That  you owe 
You've  had Julys oh so well









Mrs. Bluebird, on my shoulder
How's  your life since you've gotten older?
How's Mr. Bluebird? Is he well?
Keepin' warm through the cold spell
