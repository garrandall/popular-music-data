Tomorrow when I'm walking down the aisle
I'll try to hide my heartache with a smile
'Cause when I look at him and say I do
In my heart, I'll be wishing it was you

Tomorrow when you see me pass you by
Thank you for using Top40db. Com
Just turn your head so you won't see me cry
And just remember when I say I do
In my heart, I'll be wishing it was you

You listened when they said I cheated
And you listened when they said I lied
Yes, you listened to all of their stories
But you didn't listen to my side

So tomorrow when the chapel bells begin
I'll have to think of you as just a friend
But when I say those precious words, I do
In my heart, I'll be wishing it was you

In my heart (in my heart)
I'll be wishing (I'll be wishing)
It was you
