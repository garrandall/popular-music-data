Yeah
It's that thug shit
Yeah - all my thug bitches, all my thug niggaz
It's MellowHype, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Uhh, Left Brain, yo
We be thuggin deep; runnin 'round the hood
like doggies in the street, you feelin froggy then leap
Pass by the feds and its foggy in the Jeep
Fuck yo' opinion and your blog and your peeps
Everybody wanna talk this and that
'til I leave your body in the alley with piss and rats
Go ahead nigga, you can diss the track
Face-to-face with my chrome, now diss my gat
Naw I don't play with guns, you can diss my bat
It'll be a home run, nigga off wit'cha cap
Cause if I pop a shot, it'll be too loud
Neighbors comin out the house fuckin formin a crowd
Jose Canseco, all about my peso
Stack it like Lego, hot like fuego
Left Brain from the Gang full of Wolves that red
Eyes bloodshot red nigga would you stare?


We be thuggin


Before I try a coat, I put on my cloak
I mouthwash all you bacteria, no soap
When the situations get bad and niggaz start to choke
I get a little jumpy and I just might croak
Presidential campaign, gettin every vote
Starin the game down through my, authentic locs
Beach Cruise, Pasadena, 250 spokes
I swear I am the truth - wanna hear me tell a joke?
I run Dena with a lyrical quote
Controllin niggaz ears like I got a remote
Bring a bitch around me and that's all she wrote
I'm acid like the citrus when she swallow the pulp
It ain't fashion when I'm whippin, I'm True to my Religion
Gettin wisdom in return with this music I be givin
I'm so sickenin - like I got the swine flu
I'm sick in my head bitch, I got the mind flu




H.B., ha ha~! Ice cream parlor on a Sunday
Ice cold from Monday to Monday
She go both ways and my direction is one way
You can't move me, watch me like a movie
Do she really wanna do me?
"Oochie Wally Wally" bang bang bang in jacuzzis
And if these niggaz don't know who we be
in that girl coochie, get a C-L-U-E
Recognize the letters, MellowHype fly
You can tell by the feathers, I'm a ball player in
any kind of weather, strike one, and you out of
my motherfuckin house like Hugh Hefner
I laugh out loud, my pretty ass proud
If you wanna find me, I'll be in my own cloud
Writin lyrics to myself, I'm my own penpal
and I make beats mothafucker - send now
