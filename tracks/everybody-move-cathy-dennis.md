Everybody to the floor

Everybody
Everybody move!

Gold chains and shiny rings
An eye-opening sight in the fading night
She knows they're watching
As her hips breathe in for their second skin

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room (Everybody to the floor)
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine (Everybody)
Everybody move, there's no-one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Just back from Bombay
There are no frontiers now I know you're here
A telegram from a party man
We can dance all night 'cause it feels so right

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room (Everybody to the floor)
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine (Everybody)
Everybody move, there's no-one but you
And you're gonna be mine

I've got a feeling that he's looking at me
The people's idol and someone to envy
I've gotta tell him the way I'm feeling

Ohoho
The way I feel, yeah
So good, so good

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room (Everybody to the floor)
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine (Everybody)
Everybody move, there's no-one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine (Everybody)
Everybody move, there's no-one but you
And you're gonna be mine
