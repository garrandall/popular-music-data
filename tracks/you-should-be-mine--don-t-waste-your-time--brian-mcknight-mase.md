Brian McKnight F/ Mase
Miscellaneous
You Should Be Mine
Mase:
Mase, and Brian McKnight, Bad Boy
C'mon
We don't stop, we rock we rock
Yo
I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Can't sit out the gig playing 2.8
Real studded jewel funded
Got to love it
First rap cat with the R&B budget
Every day on the TV me and PD
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD
Why y'all forever roudy
I be out here somewhere in Maui
Till I go back to Cali
Brian:
Can't understand how he can treat you the that way he does
Give me the chance to show you baby, your better off with me
(OOh, so will you let me try
I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you go
I'll always be around)
And you should be mine
(He don't love you right
Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time)
He don't treat you like he should (no baby)
You should be mine
You should be mine, baby
Why can't you see
You should be happy
And I don't know why you don't believe a man can love you for the
Rest of your life
(So baby let me try
I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you down
I'll always be around)
And you should be mine
He don't love you right (Oh)
Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time
He don't treat you like he should (now)
Then you should be mine
You should be mine (Oh oh)
Mase:
Yo!
What the deal honey
Insecure feel funny
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money
Plus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays
When you shopping did you shop for 2
Uh!
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight
Or say he's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
Cuz Mase ain't the player with the PhD
Brian:
Girl come into my world
I love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries, no more
Girl open the door
And don't waste your time
Cuz you should be mine
He don't love you right (oh baby)
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
He don't treat you like he should (oh)
You should be mine (should be mine, baby baby)
He don't love you right
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
Repeat and fade out..
