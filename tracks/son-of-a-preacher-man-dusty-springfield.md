Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
A-through the backyard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
He was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, yes he was, oooh, yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away tonight?

The only boy who could ever reach me
He was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
He was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, ohh, he was, ohh, yes he was

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowing
Lookin' to see how much we've grown

And the only boy who could ever reach me
He was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
He was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, yes he was, oh, yes he was
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man
Sweet-talking son of a preacher man
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man
