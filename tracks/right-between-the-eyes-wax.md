True love for me was nothing but a mystery
Just something only captured in a dream
Oh, then suddenly
It was hitting me
Right between the eyes

I wasn't looking for a love explosion
But I must have been a target my oh my
'Cause when I least expected it
I took a direct hit
Right between the eyes

You, you shattered my resistance, yes it's true
You battered my defence, what could I do?
I'm running from the heat between me and you

You hit me with a million volts
Nailed me with a lightning bolt
Oh, baby, you knocked me cold
Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes

Now nothing's going to cool down my desire
'Cause I'm jumpin' from the fat into the fire
Love bug has bitten me
And you're hitting me
Right between the eyes

And now, each time I think about you I don't know how
I ever did without you, you spin me 'round
And I'll never get my feet back on the ground

You hit me with a million volts
Nailed me with a lightning bolt
Oh, baby, you knocked me cold
Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes

Oh, the power of your love is much too strong
You turn me on

You hit me with a million volts
Nailed me with a lightning bolt
Oh, baby, you knocked me cold, yeah
Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes

You hit me with a million volts
Nailed me with a lightning bolt
Oh, baby, you knocked me cold
Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes

Dig it
(dig it, dig it)
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
(dig it, dig it)
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
(dig it, dig it)
