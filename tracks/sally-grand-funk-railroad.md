Oh little Sally, you know I love you baby.
Sally, I said I love you baby.
Sally ... it's alright, it's alright.

Remember girl when we both was younger.
It was the days we had so much fun girl.
Rememberin' all of our childhood days, yeah.
We had our fun in so many ways.

You know I would have loved you anyway.
It ain't just something I just had to say.
Don't let them tell you that you're not my kind.
Sally, Sally, Sally tell them you're mine, mine, mine.

Sally ... yeah,
Oh little Sally, I said I love you baby.
Sally, I said I love you baby.
Sally ... it's alright.

You know I would have loved you anyway.
It ain't just something I just had to say.
Don't let them tell you that you're not my kind.
Sally, Sally, Sally tell them you're mine, mine, mine.

Oh little Sally, you know I love you baby.
Sally, I love you baby.
Sally ... it's alright, it's alright.
It's alright.

Oh little Sally, you know I love you baby.
Sally ...
Sally ... it's alright, it's alright.
It's alright.
It's alright.
