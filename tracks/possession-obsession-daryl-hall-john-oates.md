You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Oh, with money, love or power

When you want to have
The number one, first-run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

You ought to know
Better than that, girl
The more that you buy
The less you get back

You could say
It's a case of
Possession obsession
Just a taste of
Possession obsession
Brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme gimme
Now gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme

The compulsion to count
The percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
Oh, all the good times suffer

Though you know it's only jealousy
But you can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

Now, don't you know
It's a matter of fact
The more that you take
The less you give back

I can say
It's a case of
Possession obsession
Just a taste of
Possession obsession
Brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme gimme
Now gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme possession

Ooh, gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme

Ooh, it's a case of
Possession obsession
Just a taste of
Possession obsession
Brings of a case of possession
I hear you say possession

Now, don't you know
It's a matter of fact
The more that you take
(Gimme some)
The less you give back
