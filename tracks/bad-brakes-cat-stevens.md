Bad brakes whole car shakes
Looks like I'm heading for a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
I must be heading for a breakdown

I pulled up for a mouth of coca-cola
Down at Samuel's cafe
Saw a little spanish lady coming over
Said "lady are you going my way" she said "o-lay"

Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like you're heading for a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
We must be heading for a breakdown

We hit the road at 90 miles an hour
Heading for 'Frisco Bay
She said "Senor you got cop on your shoulder"
I said "oh now we'd better not stay
We got to get away with our
Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like we're heading for a breakdown"

He was catching up nose right inside our mirror
When the motor blowed
We climbed out and she began to shiver
Oh no sir please let us go
He said "don't you know you got
Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like you bought yourself a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
And you've got yourself a breakdown"

Bad brakes engine beginning to shake
Looks like we've got ourselves a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
We got ourselves a breakdown
