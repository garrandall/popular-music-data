When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door and leave me
Standing there. oh honey that's not fair
That's it! I quit! I'm moving on

Yeah. The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared the lipstick on your face
Oh they smeared it everyplace, yeah
That's it! I quit! I'm moving on, aw

You made me want you
You made me need you
You made me tumble and fall but
If I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all yeah!

Baby I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
You know your kisses thrill me so
But if you've got someone else
I've gotta go aw and that you know

That's it honey I quit I'm moving on
Yeah now!

You made me want you
You made me need you
You made me tumble and fall but
If I can't have you the way I want you
Then I don't want you at all yeah!

Baby I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
You know your kisses thrill me so
But if you've got someone else
I've gotta go aw and that you know

That's it Baby I quit I'm moving on
And one more time
That's it Honey I quit I'm moving on

Mmm I'm moving on
You done me wrong so I'm moving on
