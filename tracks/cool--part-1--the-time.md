I got a penthouse in Manhattan
Two more in Malibu
I bought a '87's Cadillac Seville, girl
I got a Mazarati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers
I got a couple on my toes
I wear the finest perfume money can buy
It keeps me smellin' like a rose

If you wonder how I do it
There's just one simple rule


I'm just cool, oh, oh, honey
Baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool
Ain't nobody bad like me?


C-O-O-L
What's that spell? C-O-O-L


I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin' place I want to
And my Lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozens
I got money by the ton
Just ain't nobody better
Heaven knows that I'm the one

And it's all because of something
That I didn't learn in school


I'm just cool, cool, cool, cool
Honey, baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool
Ain't nobody bad like me?


Sing it, baby, C-O-O-L
What's that spell? C-O-O-L
That spells cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool

What time is it? Cool

Listen baby, it takes a lot of lovin'
And a little money to be a friend of mine
But baby, if you know how to shake that thing
I'll try to squeeze a little time
'Cause I make love, love every mornin'
To who's ever by my side
'Cause you might say that I'm a nymphomaniac
But it keeps me satisfied

When I look into the mirror
It just tells me something I already know


I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool
Honey, baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool
Ain't nobody bad like me?


Sing it, C-O-O-L
What's that spell? C-O-O-L
What time is it? Four
Cool! (Well, I'm so cool)
Cool! (Girl, I'm so cool)
Cool!
Cool!

Band?!



C-O-O-L
C-O-O-L

Cool, that's right
I'm cooler than Santa Claus, baby
Oh, um hum, ain't nobody bad like me
Somebody pinch me, I must be dreamin'
(I know that's right)
'Cause there ain't nobody bad like me
What time is it?
Is it time to get my hair done yet?
I said, what time is it?

Time to just walk and shake my head
I'm cool till I'm dead
Enough has been said
Come on baby, let's go to bed

Everybody, walk, shake my head
Cool till I'm dead
Enough has been said, let's go to bed

When I look into the mirror
It just tells me something I already know


I'm so cool, there ain't nobody bad like me?
I'm so cool, I said, ain't nobody bad like me?

All together now


C-O-O-L (What's that spell?)
C-O-O-L
