Yeah


Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand (All the way up)
I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance (No)
I got a goon holdin' a burner
You can get left with a tan (Fire)
He a junkie for the dumb shit (How?)
Want all the smoke like a strand (Dope)
Just protecting the brand (You gotta protect the brand)
Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands
(Right now it's just me in here with it)
They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance
(Never get tricked out the spot)
You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can (Goin' fed)
For protecting the brand (Said what I said)
Just protecting the brand (Hey, go)

Get the drop, go hit up his block (Right now)
The chopper hold ninety-nine plus one
That's a 100 some shots for a opp (Brr)
Put on for my city every time I drop
Couple niggas stuck and they mad that I'm not
Hate that I'm hot like what's under the pot
Got 'em where I want 'em, I hear that a lot
(Hey, who you is? Tell 'em)
Big speaker, big stepper, still in rotation with the trappers and the jackers
Hot boy ridin' with the pump, asthma
Double R truck, red seats, plasma
I'm hittin' a bitch from the back, got her sayin' the brand
And free all the bros out the can (Gang)
Never see him, so we clappin' his mans like hands
Why would you play with the clan?
F and the N, A and the R
Infrared beam, it glow in the dark
Put in the work and don't tell what you saw
I'm a big driver, controllin' the car (Big bands)
They ridin', I'm wrong or right (Don't matter)
Lil' niggas tote choppas my height (6'3)
I flooded the brand' in ice (On me)
You reach, you playin' with your life (Yeah)

Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand (All the way up)
I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance (No)
I got a goon holdin' a burner
You can get left with a tan (Fire)
He a junkie for the dumb shit (How?)
Want all the smoke like a strand (Dope)
Just protecting the brand (You gotta protect the brand)
Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands
(Right now it's just me in here with it)
They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance
(Never get tricked out the spot)
You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can (Goin' fed)
For protecting the brand (Huh? Huh?)
Just protecting the brand (Okay)


You know the brand, we winnin' (Let's go)
Better ask 'bout DaBaby and see what they say
That 'lil nigga ain't playin', he wit' it (Yeah)
Nigga know I keep fire on me 24/7
You get cooked like a pan, a skillet by protecting the brand
How you standin' on that? I come step on you like you a pair of tennis (Okay)
Ain't that what they call it in Memphis? (Uh-huh)
Know a few niggas ballin' in Memphis (Ball)
Got a bag, I'm with Bagg, I'ma let you know (Yeah)
If I pull that bitch out, I'ma let it blow (Boom)
Nigga, you know I'm hot, and my bitch a hot girl
We'll pop out like we Meg and Yo
It was time to go right by the brand and your boy showed his hand
That lil' nigga was scared to go
I think these niggas scared of the label
Got a brand with my brand, way ahead of your label
We made niggas famous
Put one of yo ass on the news, now your mama scared of the cable
Ayy, baby, what you gon' do if a nigga walk down
And he caught himself checkin' the label?
Tell my lil' brother, "Pass me that AR"
Like I'm askin' for salt and pepper at the table
'Cause I'm a


Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand (All the way up)

You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can (Goin' fed)
For protecting the brand (Said what I said)
Just protecting the brand (Hey)

Turn me up, YC (Turn me up, YC, turn me up, YC)
