Every day I clock out
And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm drivin' home and it's incredibly late
Something's got to change, 'cause

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm takin' him to dinner Sunday night
I've never been so nervous in my life
I want to do this right, 'cause

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Yes sir I love her very much
I know it's only been seven months
But that's long enough

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about 
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
