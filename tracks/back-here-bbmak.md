Baby, set me free from this misery 
I can't take it no more 
Since you ran away nothing's been the same 
Don't know what I'm living for 

Here I am so alone 
And there's nothing in this world I can do 

Until you're back here baby 
Miss you, want you, need you so 
Until you're back here baby, yeah 
There's a feeling inside I want you to know 
You are the one and I can't let you go 

So I told you lies, even made you cry 
Baby, I was so wrong 
Girl, I promise you now my love is true 
This is where my heart belongs 

'Cause here I am so alone 
And there's nothing in this world I can do 

Until you're back here baby 
Miss you, want you, need you so 
Until you're back here baby, yeah 
There's a feeling inside I want you to know 
You are the one and I can't let you go 

And I wonder
Are you thinking of me? 
'Cause I'm thinking of you 
And I wonder 
Are you ever coming back in my life? 

'Cause here I am so alone 
And there's nothing in this world I can do 

Until you're back here baby 
Miss you, want you, need you so 
Until you're back here baby, yeah 
There's a feeling inside I want you to know 
You are the one and I can't let you go
