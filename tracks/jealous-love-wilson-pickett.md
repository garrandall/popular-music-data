Jealous love, jealous love of mine, jealous love
Why can't you trust me some time? Look a-here
You be so sweet, yet so kind
You're killin' my love with your jealous mind
Jealous love (jealous love)
I wanna say it one more time (jealous love)
You oughta trust me some time (trust me some time)

I take you, baby, everywhere I go
But your good intentions seem to never never show
& every time a pretty girl walks by
I catch you watchin' me, baby, from the corner of your eye
You be so sweet & yet so kind
You're killin' my love with your jealous mind
Jealous love (jealous love)
I wanna say it one more time (jealous love) wo wo
You oughta trust me some time (trust me some time)
Just have a little faith, baby, yeah yeah

I'm home from work every day on time
You got your hand in my pocket for that number you thought you'd find
Jealous love (jealous love)
I wanna say it one more time (jealous love)
You oughta trust me some time (trust me some time)
(Repeat & fade):
Jealous love (jealous love)
