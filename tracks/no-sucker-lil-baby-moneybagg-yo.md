(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah
Uh-oh, you better not trust 'em
Rotate 'em, all these hoes on shuffle
Money team, got a whole M in a duffle
Bitch got the nerve to say she don't like rubbers
She don't know that I know she be fuckin' my brother
Bitch, I ain't goin' out like no sucker, yeah
West Coast, smokin' on Gushers, yeah
Cartier watch, shit busted, yeah
I done ran up a whole lot, yeah
I don't want the twat, just top, yeah
Goin' up a whole 'nother notch, yeah
Can't be stuck in one slot, yeah

Levels, Rolls-Royce truck in the ghetto
F's on the wheel wave hello, yeah
Bitch probably mad I ain't dello
La-la-la, I am not Carmelo
Word to the opps, they gon' drop, better lay low
Haha, nah, I'm just playin', they can come out
Runnin' up the money, I ain't never tryna run out, yeah
Police get behind me, I'ma burn out (Smash)
How you get it 'fore it even come out? (Cash)
How you make a milli' in a drought? (Bag)
Traphouse geeked up fast
My mama don't like it, she ain't got no swag
I don't stay with my mama, I been in my bag
Yeah, I got it, nigga, fuck what I had, yeah
Y'all niggas need to give me my swag back
Go against me, get hashtagged
Ain't standin' that, nigga, I'm passed that
How your jacket Dior and your pants match?
Road runnin', bringin' these bands back
You can take it how you want it, I'm sayin' facts
They done crunked me up, I was layin' back
I'm the wave, nigga, give me my sand back
Hopped out on 'em with a chopstick
They done killed that boy with a hand strap
You straight, I ain't givin' your mans dap

Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah
Uh-oh, you better not trust 'em
Rotate 'em, all these hoes on shuffle
Money team, got a whole M in a duffle
Bitch got the nerve to say she don't like rubbers
She don't know that I know she be fuckin' my brother
Bitch, I ain't goin' out like no sucker, yeah
West Coast, smokin' on Gushers, yeah
Cartier watch, shit busted, yeah
I done ran up a whole lot, yeah
I don't want the twat, just top, yeah
Goin' up a whole 'nother notch, yeah
Can't be stuck in one slot, yeah

I'm goin' up a whole 'nother notch
Lil' bruh just put a nigga on Fox, damn
A rock fell out of my watch
I ain't get mad, I just switched out clocks (Hahaha)
Treat a bad bitch like a thot (What you do?)
Burn her head pullin' off the lot
Water on water, rockin' ice on the yacht
Bought a traphouse and it came with a pot (Ugh, ugh)
The game in trouble like some badass childrens
Did they just really give me 80K for thirty minutes? Yup
And can't nobody tell me how to spend it, bitch
Send it to the hood, let 'em flip it (In the trenches)
She want me to love on her, no way
Ain't Jos√©, I don't do what the hoes say (Nope)
HD, Blu-Ray, clear shit (What that mean?)
Diamonds on me look 4K (Ugh)
Married to the money for better or worse
But nah I ain't walked down no aisle (Caked up)
That lil' nigga fucked up
He'll walk a nigga down with a Kool-Aid smile
Yesterday spent 40K on a necklace
I'm flexin', look close and you'll see your reflection
She a lil' gangster, I like her complexion
She get so wetty, then bust like confetti
If I don't do nothing, that money, I get it

Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah
Uh-oh, you better not trust 'em
Rotate 'em, all these hoes on shuffle
Money team, got a whole M in a duffle
Bitch got the nerve to say she don't like rubbers
She don't know that I know she be fuckin' my brother
Bitch, I ain't goin' out like no sucker, yeah
West Coast, smokin' on Gushers, yeah
Cartier watch, shit busted, yeah
I done ran up a whole lot, yeah
I don't want the twat, just top, yeah
Goin' up a whole 'nother notch, yeah
Can't be stuck in one slot, yeah
