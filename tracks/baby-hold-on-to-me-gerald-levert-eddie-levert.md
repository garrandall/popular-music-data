All your friends are tellin' you
You should have a fancy car and diamond rings
But, girl, you know all good things come in time
Girl, you know I'll do just about anythin'
To see a smile upon your face
So don't let your friends go messin' with your mind

Girl, you know there ain't nothin'
I won't do for you
And baby, don't, don't ever
Doubt my love 'cause it's true

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Girl, wasn't I there when he made you cry?
And who was there to comfort you
When he said, "Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye," baby?
Girl, I give you my time, here is my money
All of my heart and you'll be so sorry, baby
If we were to ever part, part

And girl, you know
That I would never hurt you
Girl, you know
That I won't ever desert you

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Baby, see I wanna be everything
That you need
And I promise, baby, I promise, baby
I'll be there for you

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Hold on
See you clingin' to me
When you need someone to hold you tight
You're gonna look for me
You're gonna look for me
So you better, you better

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Hold on
Think about it before you let me
Walk out the door, baby
How can you live without me, baby?
'Cause I can't see myself
Livin' without you

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Hold on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I know I'm a good man
And your friends keep tellin' you
Your friends keep tellin' you
All about what they don't know

Baby, hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby, hold on to me

Hold on, hold on
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
I'm what you need
And I still don't believe
