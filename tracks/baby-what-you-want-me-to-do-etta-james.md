You got me runnin', got me hidin'
Run round hidin' runnin' anyway you want it.
Let it roll.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aw yeah.
Yeah, you got me where you want me now
Baby what you want me to do.

I'm going up, I'm going down.
Up, down, down, up anyway you want it.
Let it roll.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aw yeah.
Yeah, you got me where you want me now
Baby what you want me to do.

Oh baby, you don't have to go.
No, no, no.
Oh baby, baby, honey you don't have to go.
I'm gonna pack my things, and down the road I go.
Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Whoa!
Oh baby, baby, honey, honey, honey what's wrong with you?
You don't treat your momma like you used to do.
