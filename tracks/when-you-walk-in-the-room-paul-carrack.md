Baby, it's a dream come true 
Walking right alongside of you 
Wish I could tell you how much I care 
But I only have the nerve to stare 

I can feel a new expression on my face 
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place 
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes 
Every time that you walk in the room 

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want 
Meanwhile I try and act so nonchalant 
I see a summer night with a magic moon 
Every time that you walk in the room 

Baby, it's a dream come true 
Walking right alongside of you 
Wish I could tell you how much I care 
But I only have the nerve to stare 
Yeah, yeah 

I can hear something pounding in my brain 
very time that someone speaks your name 
Trumpets sounding; I hear love in bloom 
Every time that you walk in the room 

Every time that you walk in the room 

Oh yeah 
Every time you walk 
I feel a brand new way 
Oh yes I do 
Yeah, baby
