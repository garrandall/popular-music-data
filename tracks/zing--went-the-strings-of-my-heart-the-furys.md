Never could carry a tune
Never knew where to start
You came along when ev'rything was wrong
And put a song in my heart

:
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me
Started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring
I heard a robin sing
About a next set apart
All nature seemed to be
In perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through again
"I love you, I love you"

I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine
A rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
