I'm still here
You want me to buy you Victoria's Secrets?
I can do that
You want sex twice a day... Everyday?
Yo, I can do that
Be careful what you say
'Cause I'm right around the corner...
Check it out

Caramel eyes, chocolate thighs
Your honey brown
Complexion makes my nature rise
But you don't understand
You got me feinding for your candyland (yes you do)
Your voice is warm on a cold night
My cell phone bill is running out of control
So, as I talk to you, I
Hop in my whip and bring this.. to you
And you're gonna find I'll..

Sex you from head to toe
I'll kiss you where your man just refuses to go
And if you don't know, baby, now you know
Girl, I can do that. I can do that
Lady come ride with me
Tonight I'ma show you how he's supposed to be
Satisfying you sexually, yeah
I can do that, I can do that

Oh, can we share an or...gasm, baby?
Just follow my instructions very carefully (I'm gonna)
Take your clothes off...
Leave your shoes on...
The candlelight will keep your body
Nice and warm
Then after I undress you
I'll apply a little pressure, oh
It'll give you so much pleasure
It'll be like sailing away (sailing away)
Just say taht you want for me to stay, and I'll

Sex you from head to toe
I'll kiss you where your man just refuses to go
And if you don't know, baby, now you know

Satisfying you sexually, yeah

I'll sex you twice a day (I can do that)
I'll lick the champagne off of your back, yeah
I can do that, I can do that
I'll keep the kitty warm (keep the kitty warm)
Just make it purr for me (make it purr for me)
Then after I undress you
I'll apply a litte pressure, oh
It'll give you so much pleasure
I'll be like sailing away (oh!)
