When I was a very small boy
(Just a small boy)
Looked through the cornfields
And wonder (oh, I wondered)
If every man had his own piece of land
So he'd never know hunger

Oh, the time quickly rode along
(Yes, it did now) I grew up
And I left home, Lord knows
I'm sorry I ever left
I see people starving to death

You walk easy, my son (easy)
That's what my daddy said to me
Said, you be a man
And you learn all you can
? And you'll be free

Oh, I remember one rainy day back home
(I remember) Sally Brown's house
Burned down (yes, it did now) and
Everybody had to lend a helping hand
Folks came from miles around

They didn't do this
Expecting something in return
They simply did it because they cared
And these were the kind of folk
If they had anything at all
They were more than willing to share

And Daddy said, you walk easy, boy
(Walk easy) yeah, and when your
Trouble get to falling like rain
(You gotta walk easy)

Hey, I want you to understand
You keep on stepping, man
Cause it'll only bring you cold?

And now that I'm out here
In this big old world
I hear strange world like pollution
And I see a man that needs
A helping hand have to go somewhere
To find his own solution

Oh, my Lord, how this
Whole world had changed
I say, God, save us all
Yeah, I hate the day that I ever came
This world is heading
For a great big fall

And you walk easy, son (easy)
Yeah, that's what my Daddy
Said to me, he said
You know you can't trust everyone
Cause it will only bring you misery

You walk easy, my son (easy)
And when your trouble get
To falling like rain, oh
Don't you try to trust everybody, child
Cause it will only bring you pain
