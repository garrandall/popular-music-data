First, you take my heart
In the palm of your hands
And you squeeze it
Then you take my mind
And play with it all night

You take my pride and you
Throw it up against the wall
You take me in your arms, baby
And bounce me like a rubber ball

I`m not complaining
What you`re doing, you see
Cause this hurting feeling
Is, ooh, so good to me

Don`t you know that it
Hurts so good
Don`t you know that it
Hurts so good

You take my name
Scandalize it in the streets
Anything you wanna do or say
Is alright with me

Turn right around and
Make sweet love to me
Ooo wee, baby, you`re
Sure nuff good to me

Cause, baby, these
Things youre doing to me
It hurts so bad but
It`s worth all the misery

Cause it hurts so good
Don`t you know that
It hurts so good
Ooh, hoo, baby, ooh...

Ooh, boy, please don`t
Ever take the hurt off me
Cause it would hurt even worse
If you would ever, ever leave
(Oh, yes, it would)

Even though sometimes
It`s hard for me to beg
(This heart is killing me)
I make myself hold out
Cause if it kills me, I don`t care

Cause, baby (baby)
I don`t want you to ever quit
It ain`t no good until it
Hurts a little bit

Cause it hurts so good
Don`t you know that
It hurts so good
Oh, baby

It hurts so good
Don`t you ever, don`t
You ever stop now, baby
Give me some, baby
(Lord, have mercy)

It hurts so good
Don`t you know that
It hurts so good to me
Good for me, yeah, yeah

Hurts so good
Ooh, baby
