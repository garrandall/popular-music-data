With cops, got the block hot like a Jamaican clubs
Cop weight, wait for a drought and then make it flood

I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gonna be two soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows
I made more dough on the grind than going gold
That's why I stay fly and I'm 'flage-ing on hoes
Floss is so cool, in Austin no shoes
Just a rubberband on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules and I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler, ask about me


I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler, homey, yeah

To get paid you got a save don't be spending the change
In 5th grade I was hustling my Genesis games
I was dumb, young, selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
"More money, more problems" is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude's voice, props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hot line, I made a hot song
So, stop drawing, man, you got to respect it
I'm the best, Swizz got to perfect it, don't mess with
C-A-double-S-I-D-Y
'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died
The Kid do it big like P-U-N
Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N and


I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler, homey, yeah
I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler, homey, yeah
Nigga, ask, nigga, nigga, ask about me, yeah
Nigga, ask, nigga, nigga, ask about me, yeah
I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler, homey, yeah
