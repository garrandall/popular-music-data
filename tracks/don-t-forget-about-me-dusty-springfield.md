Baby, I know you've got to go
And I have no right to tell you not to go
The road just isn't there for us
There never was a prayer for us

Someday our paths may cross again
And maybe we'll find the kind of love we lost again
But now, I'll set you free to choose again
It's your life to win or lose again

Hey, don't forget about me now, baby
Baby, please, don't forget about me now, baby
Today I cannot borrow a minute of your tomorrow
But don't let it cause you sorrow

Please, don't forget about me now, baby
Don't forget about me

Someday, our paths may cross again
And maybe we'll find the kind of love we lost again
But now, I've got to let you go
It's ourselves we got to get to know

Oh, hey, don't forget about me now, baby
Baby, please, don't forget about me now
Baby, please, please don't forget about me, baby
Ooh, baby, please, oh
Hey, don't forget about me now, baby
Baby, please, please don't forget about me
Ah-ha, yeah, ooh
