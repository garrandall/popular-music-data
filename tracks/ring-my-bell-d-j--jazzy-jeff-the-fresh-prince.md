Yo, baby, you know what's up
Girl, you can call me up
And you and I can talk for hours and hours at a time
This as an invitation
To a conversation
So when things get bad you know I'll be there to soothe your mind
Just call me up on the telephone
When you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell


Come and ring my bell, ring my bell
(my bell, ding-dong, ding-dong)
Come and ring my bell, ring my bell
(my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling)


Girl the way he treats you it's a crying shame
Like you're a toy and like your life is just some silly game
How long you gonna live in a situation like this
Cause you're a princess baby and you deserve a prince
Why can't you see it, it's plain as day right here before your eyes
I'm telling the truth while your man insists on telling you lies
He stays out all night but I'd be home by 8
And oh and about loving, hm it's grrrrrrreat
I don't mean to insult your man up
But I'm trying to plan the
Rest of our lives together forever and ever
But first you got to stand up
Pick yourself up on your own two
Cause girl don't nobody own you
You don't feel well and I can tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell



BREAK!
You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
Ding dong ding, hey-hey, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anyplace
Ring it (you)
Ring it (you)
Ring it, ring it Ah


Open up your mind and you can see that I'm
Just trying to make you happy
And like I said a 1000 times
If you didn't love me you wouldn't be calling me up every night
To wipe your tears 'cause you and your man just had another fight
Who loves ya baby, I do
You know he doesn't care about you, let him go
Where's he at now, you don't know
Laying up under some hooo-ld up, wait, just let me chill
No need for me to get ill
'cause every time your heart gets knocked over
You know I'll wipe the spill
I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look
At what the future holds for you and
If you _ then you might ruin something great
Don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and down
It's sort of a mission
Now you're on a rocky road
But you can get off
Just make that decision
That you want someone to love you, adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way, baby you can ring my bell


(Repeat till fade)
