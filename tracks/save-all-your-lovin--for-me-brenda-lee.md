Let me tell you
What's on my mind
There ain't no fooling
I'm in love this time
Yeah, baby
Save all your loving for me
I want your kisses
Yes, every night
Loving arms to squeeze me
Real tight
Yeah, baby
Save all your loving for me
I go to bed
I can't sleep
It's got so bad
I can't count sheep
I toss and turn
The whole night through
One of these days
I'm gonna get you
I wanna tell you
What I'd like you to do
Love me like I love you
Yeah, baby
Save all your loving for me
I go to bed
I can't sleep
It's got so bad
I can't count sheep
I toss and turn
The whole night through
But one of these day
I'm gonna get you
I wanna tell you
What I'd like you to do
I want you to love me
Like I love you
And, baby
Save all you loving for me
Yeah, baby
Save all your loving for me
I want you to save
Save all your loving for me
