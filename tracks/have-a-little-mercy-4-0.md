Oh, oh, oh, oh
Have a little mercy
Heaven knows I wouldn't hurt you, girl
So I told a lie I wanted to protect

But I shoulda known you'd hear the truth somehow
Now I'm terrified you're walking out
And the thought of losing you is killing me, babe
'Cuz I know that I'll go crazy without you

Forgive me, darling, will you have a little mercy on me?
I won't stop trying till you have a little mercy on me
Shoo, doo, doo, sho, do, do, do, do, sho, do, do, do, do
Have a little mercy on me

Acted selfishly and brought pain in your life
I know you don't believe me but I'm sorry
'Cuz I wanna make it up to you
Just let me show my love is true
And the thought of losing you is killing me, babe
'Cuz I know that I'll go crazy without you

Forgive me, darling, will you have a little mercy on me?
I won't stop trying till you have a little mercy on me
Shoo, doo, doo, sho, do, do, do, do, sho, do, do, do, do
Have a little mercy on me

Forgive me, babe, shoop, dup
Forgive me
(Forgive me)
Have mercy
(Have mercy)
That's how I feel, baby

Hold me, oh no, baby
Forgive me
(Forgive me)
Have mercy
(Have mercy)
Baby, going crazy

Hold me, please don't go, no, no, no, no
No, and if you could give your trust back to me, babe
I will be the man you wanted me to be
'Cuz to lose your love is just like killing me

I love you, I need you, baby
I said that I need you
I love you, I need you, baby
I love you, I need you, baby, oh

Forgive me, darling, will you have a little mercy on me?
I won't stop trying till you have a little mercy on me
Shoo, doo, doo, sho, do, do, do, do, sho, do, do, do, do
Have a little mercy on me

Forgive me, darling, will you have a little mercy on me?
I won't stop trying till you have a little mercy on me
Shoo, doo, doo, sho, do, do, do, do, sho, do, do, do, do
Have a little mercy on me

Have a little mercy
Have a little mercy
Just a little bit, baby
Oh, have a little mercy

Have a little mercy
I just wanted you to be there, baby
Have a little mercy on me
I'm begging, babe

Have a little mercy
I'm begging, babe
Have a little mercy on me
I begging you, babe
Just a little bit
Have a little mercy on me
