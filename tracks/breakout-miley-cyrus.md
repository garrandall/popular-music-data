Every weeks the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8 AM's crazy

Tired of being told what to do
So unfair
So uncool

The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'til I hear the bell ring

'cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)


Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh.

Hangin' out's just somethin' we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use



I wish it would never end,
Spending time with my friends.
Oh with my friends!
