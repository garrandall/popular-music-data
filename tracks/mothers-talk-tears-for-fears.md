My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
We can work it out
My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
We can work it out
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
We can work it out


It's not that you're not good enough
It's just that we can make you better
Given that you pay the price
We can keep you young and tender
Following the footsteps of a funeral pyre
You were paid not to listen now your house is on fire


Wake me up when things get started
When everything starts to happen


My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
We can work it out
My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
We can work it out
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
We can
Only we can work it out


Some of us are horrified
Others never talk about it
But when the weather starts to burn
Then you'll know that you're in trouble
Follow in the footsteps of a soldier girl
It is time to put your clothes on and to face the world


Don't you feel your luck is changing
When everything starts to happen
Put your head right next to my heart
The beat of the drum is the fear of the dark

My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
We can work it out
My features form with a change in the weather
Better late than never, there's a change in the weather
We can work it out
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
We can
Only we can work it out
