To be the last to leave the last to be gone
Stolen from the ones who held onto it
To be the last in line oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it

Almost a breakdown of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick like a whip through the air
Long distance winners will we survive the flight
Not one of us runs from the fire light

I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
For us there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

To be the last to leave what caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night there was no competition
Well to survive do it right and you believe in the five
To survive the distance everyone fights
Everyone fights and the fire flies

What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night
Some call it my nightmare my five fireflies
Well like a sailing ship on one of love's rocks, no one

Of our love affair like a whip through the air
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
Fireflies
