I've been away so long, fought a war that's come and gone
Doesn't anybody know my name?
My sister's up and wed, my mama has took to bed
Now my old dog red's gone lame
Please tell me if you can what time do the trains roll in?
Two-ten, six-eighteen
Ten-forty- four

The house is falling down, no use in hangin' 'round
Doesn't anybody know my name?
The girl I left behind, she's gone with a friend of mine
I don't have to read a sign to know things ain't the same
Please tell me if you can what time do the trains roll in?
Two-ten, six-eighteen
Ten-forty-four

Ya can't go far away on just a soldier's pay
Doesn't anybody know my name?
Use'ta be when I could see, everybody wanted me
Now nobody comes to see a blind man catch a train
Please tell me if you can what time do the trains roll in?
Two-ten, six-eighteen
Ten-forty-four
