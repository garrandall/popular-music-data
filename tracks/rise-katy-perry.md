I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh


(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in my veins)
I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform


When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise


I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...


(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in your veins)
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed


’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise


(Don't doubt it, don't doubt it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(You know it, you know it)
Still rise
(Just fight it, just fight it)
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
