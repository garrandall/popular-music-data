I was workin my magic one night at the rusty spur
I was talkin that you know what to you know her
I was layin it down like barbeque sauce brushin it on real thick
When he walk in she flashed him a grin
I never lost a woman that quick


Aww damn you bubba
And your 82 cadillac
And your new hairdo and your dancin shoes
For makin me look bad
Damn you bubba
And your 50 dollar bank roll
Brand new jeans I know what that means
You musta gotta job
Aww damn you bubba

Last week bubba sat at the shallow end of the bar
He was one of us tryin his best to just win a heart
I walked up to him and said hey bubba let me get in on your plan
He leaned back and laughed and said "the bubba dont run with a wing man"


Aww damn you bubba
And your 82 cadillac
And your new hairdo and your dancin shoes
For makin me look bad
Damn you bubba
And your 50 dollar bank roll
Brand new jeans I know what that means
You musta gotta job
And I dont
Aww damn you bubba
Damn you bubba


Turned in my application friday mornin
At 6 am on the dot
The man called monday said im sorry
Bubba done filled that spot




And I dont
I gotta get a job
Damn you bubba
