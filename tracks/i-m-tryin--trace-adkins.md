This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin'
It's been two years since we've finalized
I still ain't used to puttin' ex, in front of wife
But I'm tryin'


Send more money right away is pretty much all she has to say
When she calls these days, and don't you be late


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'


I remember daddy sayin' keep your eye on the ball
Run like hell, play to win, get up when you fall
I'm tryin'
Don't say nothin' that you can't take back
Never do anything you might regret, no don't do that
Daddy, I'm tryin'


Know the difference between heaven and hell
Go easy on the bottle, be hard on yourself
And I know he meant well


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'
I keep on tryin'


But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, well that's all I can be
And I keep on tryin'
All I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin'


But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and stumblin' and then fallin' and then climbin'
But I keep on tryin'


This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin'
