(Everybody must get stoned)

Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
Hey, and they'll stone you just like they said they would
Well, then they'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home
And they'll stone ya when you're left all alone
But I would not feel so all alone, talk to me
Everybody must get stoned, tonight we will

Yeah, wooh
Oh, Lord have mercy now
Uh huh, just like that
Come on, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Over here now, give it up, you over there

Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' down the street
And they'll stone you when you're tryin' to find your seat
Hey, I've seen people stoned when they're walkin' through the door
Hey, hey, I've seen 'em stoned, and they'll come back for more
But I would not feel so all alone
Not tonight, 'cause everybody must get stoned

Right now, uh huh, yeah
Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about
Bring it on home
Wooh, ow, ow, ow
I said right now, right now

Well, hell I would not feel so all alone
'Cause everybody must get stoned

Yeah, wooh
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
I could use some of that
(Another one of those)
