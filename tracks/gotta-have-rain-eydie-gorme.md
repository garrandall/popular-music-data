If you didn't have rain
Then you couldn't have flowers
You couldn't have flowers
If you didn't have showers
Nowhere to swim
There'd be no babbling brook
There'd be no fish to catch
On the end of a You couldn't wash your hands and face
You'd be as black as coal
All day you'd face the barren waste
Looking for a water hose
So you gotta have rain
Every now and then
To make the whole world shine
Then every day will turn out fine

Okay kids, let's see now
Oh, if you didn't have rain
You wouldn't have (ice cream!)
If you didn't have rain
You wouldn't have (a bat!)
If you didn't have rain
Then you couldn't have (fishes!)
And you couldn't have (a swim!)
If you didn't have rain

You'd be so awfully dirty
You'd be as black as ink
All day you'd face the barren waste
Looking for a nice cool drink
So you gotta have rain
Every now and then
To make the whole world shine
Then every day will turn out fine

Let's really hear it this time!
If you didn't have rain
Then you couldn't have flowers
You couldn't have flowers
If you didn't have showers
Nowhere to swim
There'd be no babbling brook
There'd be no fish to catch
On the end of a You couldn't wash your hands and face
You'd be as black as ink
All day you'd face the barren waste
Looking for a nice cool drink
So you gotta have rain
Every now and then
To make the whole world shine
Then every day will turn out fine!
