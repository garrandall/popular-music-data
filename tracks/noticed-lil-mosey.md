Ughh
Yeah, yeah

Bitches switched up and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin money nigga cause' that my main focus
Talkin' down to all these bitches, yes I know this
Need a thottie, Cali body tryna go with this
I don't know how to face it, go there
Got too much going, think I'm fiendin' for that Goyard
Like I'm up, Maison if you test me I'm gon' go there
22, up on front, you can't go there

I don't know why niggas be frontin'
(Yeah)
I don't know why niggas be talkin'
(Yeah)
I don't know why niggas be flexin'
I do what I want, stop talking
DJ Dee, they was softin', we was thuggin'
You don't know me, I been juggin' for a moment
Said I'm a G, say we trappin' so we thumbin'
Said we thumbin' yeah
I said we thumbin' yeah
Fuck school, I stuck to rapping, I love fast money
If you with it, better know you can't turn back from it
Just caught some green for the wood I said and now we bluntin'
Flipped a brick, now they ballin' and now it subbin'
2-2-3 and it's fool, so we can blast off
Fast cars full of bitches like it mask off
My bitches 10, toot it again and I dash off
Stick em up and I did that shit now mask off

Bitches switched up and act like I ain't noticed
I just run it up cause' that the main focus
Talkin' down to all these bitches, yes I know this
Need a thottie, Cali body tryna go with this
I don't know how to face it, go there
Got too much going, think I'm fiendin' for that Goyard
Like I'm up, Maison if you test me I'm gon' go there
22, up on front, you can't go there

Taken for what? Only tell truth
Sayin' they sparking you know it ain't true
Niggas be talking but never come through
Saying they banging but I know it's cool, yeah
Yeah, what's new?
What's new?
What's new?
Grew up fifty avenue, tweak a lay up, flexin' through
Need a bigger revenue so I say tryin' to settle you
Niggas always testing me so I stay with that 32
You came overthrowing me, girl we gon' blast that 22
Yeah, you know
I said you know, yeah
I turn heads when I, roll through yeah
You know I'm with the, with the crew yeah
Circle small so It's just 2x2 through yeah

Bitches switched up and act like I ain't noticed
I just run it up cause' that the main focus
Talkin' down to all these bitches, yes I know this
Need a thottie, Cali body tryna go with this
I don't know how to face it, go there
Got too much going, think I'm fiendin' for that Goyard
Like I'm up, Maison if you test me I'm gon' go there
22, up on front, you can't go there
