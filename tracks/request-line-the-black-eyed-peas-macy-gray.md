Tell the DJ spin it on the mix show
Make a brother feel like im down at the disco
And we gonna keep it going like crisco
Cuz the DJ grab the record by the fist full
by the crate full, and we greatful
When you hear the stuff of records get a tasteful

To the direction of the record we swayed
And all night through the session we stayed
