Here we stand
Somewhere in between this moment and the end
Will we bend
Or will we open up and take this whole thing in

Everybody else is smiling
Man, their smiles don't fade
You don't even wonder why
You just don't think that way

Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move on and we can't stay here
Maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Man this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

Take my hand
I will lead you through the broken promise land
Yes I can, oh, yes I can
I can be there when you need it
I'll give it all 'til you can't feel it anymore

I don't wanna love you now
If you'll just leave some day
I don't wanna turn around
If you'll just walk away
