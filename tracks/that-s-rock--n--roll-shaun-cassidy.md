When I was sixteen, and sick of school
I didn't know what I wanted to do
I bought a guitar
I sang my heart out
That's Rock N' Roll

I played at parties, played at bars
I spent my money buyin' new guitars
I screamed my heart out
But how I loved it
That's Rock N' Roll

Come on everybody get down and get with it!
Come on everybody get down and get with it!
Come on everybody get down and get with it!
That's Rock N' Roll

And if you feel it, clap your hands;
You'll see some sweat from the boys in the band
Just get the rhythm, and let it fill ya
That's Rock N' Roll

Come on everybody get down and get with it!
Come on everybody get down and get with it!
Come on everybody get down and get with it!
That's Rock N' Roll
