Ahh, P-Mo bomp bobble

This is the story of Captain Hook
A young Swede that liked to cook up rhymes
In the bathroom all alone
Singing hooky hooky gibberish into his phone
There's no need to steal from Marvin Gaye (no!)
When the hottest hooks are public domain
'Cause if Foster Sylvers's got a misdemeanor
I'll make off with a felony explicit or clean
Or whatever you need to bleep in the mix
I still make hits that don't even rhyme
That aren't even in time

I'm Captain Hook (I'm so catchy)
I'm Captain Hook (I'm so catchy)
I'm Captain Hook (I'm catchy baby)
I'm Captain Hook (I'm so catchy)

Through my veins, the chorus is coursin'
Mainstream and delicious like Orson (yeah)
Franchise the verse in a spin-off (spin-off)
I'm climbin' Mount Cleverest on a Wim Hof (yeah)
I'll make your mother proud of you the family unit
I'll make your mother proud of you the family unit
I slow down when others go faster
Forget the writing, I am the master
(Go, future, stray) Take delivery
('Cause on a bank run, I got stability)
Learn somethin', edutainment
Focus on your breath, I'm a brain mint

I'm Captain Hook (I'm so catchy)
I'm Captain Hook (So catchy)
I'm Captain Hook (I am so catchy)
I'm Captain Hook (Well uh)

Oh wow
Wow
(Aye Joe, let it go)

Bed-wetter, go-getter
Just another Jay rappin'
GitHub bootstrappin'
Bed-wetter, go-getter
This is my life, this is my story
Bed-wetter, go-getter
Just another Jay rappin'
GitHub bootstrappin'
Bed-wetter, go-getter
This is my life, this is my story

I'm Captain Hook (I'm so catchy)
I'm Captain Hook He's very talented
I'm Captain Hook (So catchy baby)
I'm Captain Hook (Can you catch me now)
I'm Captain Hook He's very talented
I'm Captain Hook He's very talented
I'm Captain Hook (He's Captain Hook)
I'm Captain Hook

I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
I'm Captain Hook
And I'm P-Mo baby
