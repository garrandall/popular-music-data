(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Pick up on the fact (Take in stride)
Love and devotion (Don't confide)
It's the tracks of lost emotion (Let it glide)
It's gonna subside


She stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


(What'cha gonna do)
When I think I'm in love
And I catch my girl doin' the wrong (Too bad)
It's just another setback in this life
(Like when you get your first ticket for illegal parking)
(But don't you know)
It's no big deal (Take it slow)
She's not for real (Let it go)


But you know uphill she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Pick up on the fact (Take in stride)
Love and devotion (Don't confide)
In the tracks of lost emotion (Let it glide)
It's gonna subside


Oh she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


(What'cha gonna do)
When I get to the goal and my friends all tell me
When I'm playing the fool (Too bad)
She makes you feel so out of place
(Like when you run a red light
And find yourself pulling over)
(But don't you know) it's no big deal
(Take it slow) she's not for real
(Let it go)


But you know uphill she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(She stole his heart)


It's just a misdemeanor
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, she stole his heart)


It's just a misdemeanor, yeah
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
(Oh, she stole his heart)


It's just a misdemeanor, yeah
(You got to get her over it)
(Already loved her from the start)


You got to get over it
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
(Oh, she stole his heart)
It's just a misdemeanor
