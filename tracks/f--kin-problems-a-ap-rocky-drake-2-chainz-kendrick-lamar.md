Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it, ayy


Oh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a read-along
Ain't a sing-a sing-along 'less you brought the along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a no don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then for my head get to
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long ain't ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast


I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
If findin' somebody real is your p-p-problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it


Uh, yeah, yeah, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a don’t-a don't exist
Girl, I know you want this
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast


I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
I love bad bad, that's my that's my problem
And yeah, I like to, I got a p-p-problem
If findin' somebody real is your p-p-problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
