This is hopeless
Yes, it's so hopeless
Cause you're not
Coming back anymore

Oh, I tried
Yes, I tried to forget you
I've tried running around
But I find

That it's hopeless
Yes, it's hopeless
I just can't get you
Out of my mind

I keep telling my heart
That I'm lucky
That I'm much better off
All alone

But it's hopeless
It's just hopeless
Cause my heart has
A mind of it's own

I walk away the nights
Until the city lights
Fade into another lonely day

I still can't go to bed
I walk some more instead
But I just can't
Walk those blues away

I keep praying that you'll
Change your mind, dear
And I'll see your
Sweet face at the door

But it's hopeless
Yes, it's so hopeless
Cause you're not
Coming back anymore

Yes, it's so hopeless
