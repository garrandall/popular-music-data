Baby, baby, baby

Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
And that look in, in your eyes, it just takes me apart
But, please don't open the door to Heaven if I can't, if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, don't do it sweetheart

Don't give me something that you might soon, soon take away baby
To have you and then lose you that wouldn't be smart on my part
Baby, baby don't open the door to Heaven if you won't, if you won't let me in
And please, don't touch me unless you love me, sweetheart
Please, don't touch me unless you love me, don't do it sweetheart
