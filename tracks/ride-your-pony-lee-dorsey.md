(Ride your pony) get on your pony & ride; all right!
(Ride your pony) get on your pony & ride; ah you're ridin' high!
Now stay in the saddle
(We're gonna ride) way west where the grass is green
(Ride) California, you know what I mean
(Ride) New York City & Detroit too
(Ride) on to New Orleans, the home of the blues

(chorus)
(Pistol yeah) now get ready
Now shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang)

(chorus)
(We're gonna ride) to St. Louis where the girls are pretty
(Ride) Atlanta, GA, what a swingin' city
(Ride) Got to make it, that's for sho'
(Ride) Move on furthermo'

(chorus)
(Pistol yeah) now get ready
Now shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang) Shoot! (bang)
(Ride, ride) All right now, stay beside me, stay beside me
(Ride, ride) All right! (Ride, ride)
...& fade
