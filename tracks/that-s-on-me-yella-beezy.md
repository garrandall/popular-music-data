No Twitter, but these niggas follow me
Keep that fire on me, they talkin' 'bout robbin' me
Keep it one hunnid, bitch, you ain't gotta lie to me
Same nigga ride with me, I thug wit' in poverty
I don't talk my business, keep my shit privately
Can't go behind bars, got a family that rely on me
And a nigga too 'noid, so that pistol right on side of me
Say I act out violently, nigga move silently
Never been a pussy, so that shit ain't inside of me
Nigga want war, well go start a rivalry
Young nigga doin' numbers, you would think I hit the lottery
Baby girl swallow me, deep throat, gargle me
Rumor round the city, that some pussy nigga shot at me
But I was outta town, yeah seem like a lie to me
And the money that you countin' up, shit ain't a lot to me
Fuck is you mean boy? Gangsta in my jeans boy
Walkin' in shoes that you ain't ever seen, boy
I don't like talkin' so the choppa got a beam, boy
When the bitch get to sparkin', it'll hit a nigga's spleen, boy
Too much powerslidin' make a nigga lean, boy
Next year is a drug, yeah I heard he a green boy
Mixin' this red with a little bit of green, boy
Play with me if ya wanna, it'll be a crime scene boy


Yeah, you can snooze if you wanna, but not on me, baby
And nah, I ain't takin' no losses, yeah I got heat, baby
No, I don't know nothin' 'bout dozin', no, I don't sleep, baby
You niggas ain't gassin' me, nigga, yeah I'm on E, baby
Got all designer on me, that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, that's on me, baby, yeah
These niggas be lyin' on me, that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, yeah that's on me, baby, yeah
