We were just kids,
Playin' in the rain,
When you threw a stone,
And you broke a window pane.

You were so afraid,
For what you done,
That I held your hand, little one,
And I wouldn't let you run.

Then you turned to me with a look of shame,
On your face,
And your eyes asked a question,
Ever so tenderly.

Ohh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew,
How it always be...
Put the blame...
Put it on me.

Ewwww,
At the age of twelve,
You were a fine young thing.
But I felt much older,
'Cause I had to shoulder,
The trouble you'd bring.

Like the time you pushed Sonny,
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes,
You turned and you looked at me, oh
Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew,
How it always be...
Put the blame...
Put it on me.

Put it on me...
Put it on me...

Now you're all grown up,
And you're running wild.
And they're surprised,
'Cause all along you seemed,
Like such a sweet child.

And there's nothing but bad news,
For? I need.
How you've become,
A woman of the street.

They give a million and one reasons why,
But when I analyze it,
I know where the real fault lies.

Ohhh,
Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it...
Ewww,
This time rightfully,
Put the blame...
Put it on me.

Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Ewww,
Put the blame...
Put it on me.

Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame...
Put it on me.
