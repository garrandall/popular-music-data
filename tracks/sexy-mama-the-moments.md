Ah
Here we go again
It's time to get down
Sexy mama

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Do it to me now, baby, yeah

Come on sexy mama
Come on lay back and let me soothe you
Take it easy, baby
Let me do what I wanna do to you

I wanna open up them love gates
To my heaven
This afternoon I know you'll like me
By tonight you're gonna love me

I think in just a moment
There's gonna be a love explosion
Go head and let your jones
Get good and funky, ooh

Come on sexy mama
You're just the way I want you to be
Take it easy, baby
Go head and lay that thing on me

I better pinch myself to make sure that I'm not dreamin, oh
Cause the way you make me feel, I feel like, oh, screamin
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Do it to me now, baby, yeah

Come on sexy mama
Come on lay back and let me soothe you
Take your time, baby
Let me do what I wanna do to you

I wanna open up them love gates
To my heaven
This afternoon I know you'll like me
But tonight you're gonna love me

I think in just a moment
There's gonna be a love explosion
Go head and let your jones
Get good and funky, ooh

Come on sexy mama
You're just the way I want you to be
Take your time now, baby
Go head and lay that thing on me

I better pinch myself to make sure that I'm not dreamin, oh
Cause the way you make me feel, I feel like, whoa, gettin down

Sock it to me now, baby, ooh
