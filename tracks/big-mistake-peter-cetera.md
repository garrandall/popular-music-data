Keeps them all waiting
They're standing in line
He never has to worry about being alone
He's taking his own sweet time 
The man's mighty hot
Believe it or not
Every woman's after what the big boy's got
They know it's all a lie but they're taking their shot 

He is such a smooth-talking man
They never want to let him go
He'll be gone when the morning comes
Then they'll be the first to know 

It's just a big mistake
Such a big mistake
Well, it won't be the first
It definitely won't be the last one you make
Just a big mistake 

Sooner or later they're gonna find out
He never cares about the hearts he's breaking tonight
He's letting it all hang out
The man's mighty tough
Better leave before it starts to get too rough 

He such a smooth-talking man
They never want to let him go
He'll be gone when the morning comes
Then they'll be the first to know 

It's a big mistake
Such a big mistake
Well, it won't be the first
It definitely won't be the last one you make
Such a big mistake
Just a big mistake
Such a big mistake
Such a big mistake 

You might think you oughta call him Mr. Right
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight
You might think you oughta call him Mr. Right
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight 

In the morning when you find him gone
It's a big mistake
You know you've been lied to
In the morning when you know you're wrong
Such a big mistake
There's no one to cry to 

In the morning when you find him gone
It's a big mistake
You know you've been lied to
In the morning when you're so alone
Such a big mistake
When you're so alone 

In the morning when you find him gone
In the morning when you know you're wrong
In the morning when you find him gone
In the morning you'll be so alone, so alone
