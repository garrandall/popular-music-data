You're the whisper of a summer breeze
You're the kiss that puts my soul at ease
What I'm saying is I'm into you
Here's my story and the story goes
You give love, you get love
And more than heaven knows


You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please


(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
(Rush, rush) I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya get free with me
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
(Rush, rush) Ooh, what you do to me


And all I want from you is what you are
And even if you're right next to me
You're still too far away
If I'm not inside your arms
I get dramatic, baby, yes, I know
But I need you, I want you, oh, man, I love you so


You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please


(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
(Rush, rush) I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya get free with me
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
(Rush, rush) Ooh, what you do to me
(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
(Rush, rush) I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya get free with me
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
(Rush, rush) Ooh, what you do to me


When you kiss me up and down
You turn my senses all around
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I don't know just how or why
But no one else has touched me
So deep, so deep, so deep inside


You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please


(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
(Rush, rush) I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya get free with me
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
(Rush, rush) Ooh, what you do to me
(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
(Rush, rush) I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya get free with me
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
(Rush, rush) Ooh, what you do to me


(Rush, rush) No, no, no, no, no
(Rush, rush) No, no, no, no, no
(Rush, rush) No, no, no, no, no
(Rush, rush) No, no, no, no, no
(Rush, rush) Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
