When you walk in the house show me love (21)
It ain't even gotta be Valentine's day
I'ma still leave some roses by the tub
Go through so much in the street
I just wanna come home to a meal and hug (Straight up)
The opps wanna kill me, you wanna argue
I sleep in a trap and just thug (I swear)
But I'd rather you show me some love (21)

I'd rather you show me it's real
I'd rather you tell me your feelings
Than act like I'm trippin' and high on a pill
Don't say that you crazy in love with me
'Cause being crazy could lead you to kill (sure)
And money ain't nothing
There's people who happy in love
And behind on they bill (21)
And they haven't paid they mortgage in years (oh, God)
Let me help you fight your fears
Can't turn my back
When my grandma died
Man you helped me wipe my tears (21)
Cold-hearted when I opened up
Man your love, was that a bear? (Too late)
By the time you realized it was PTSD
You ain't even care damn

Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love
Show me love, love

Show me love like, you see red lights
And you crashed in it like a deer inside of headlights
Yeah, I showed you love like it was passionate
I just wanna bask in it, winnin' it like a championship
You gon' show me love like, like you tried it and denied it
But you still let me apply it like I made you put your ties in
Show me lo-o-ove, even when you don't got time to
I'll be there to find ya, I'll remind ya

Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love, love, love, love
Show me love, love, love, love, love

Baby, you know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You know what it is, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You gon' show what it means to love (Yeah)
To know what it is
You gon' show what it means to love (Yeah)
You know what it is

Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and minutes for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up, baby, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah (We gon' get it, get it)
Like we never done it (We never did it)
Baby, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Yeah, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Yeah
