Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love
Show me love, love


Show me love like you see red lights
And you crashed in it like a deer inside of headlights
Yeah, I showed you love like it was passionate
I just wanna bask in it, winnin' it like a championship
You gon' show me love like, like you tried it (Yeah) and denied it (Yeah)
But you still let me apply it (Yeah) like I made you put your ties in
Show me lo-o-ove, even when you don't got time to
I'll be there to find ya, I'll remind ya


Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love, love, love, love
Show me love, love, love, love, love


Baby, you know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and minutes for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us

Like we never done it (We never did it)
Baby, I'm in love
