I guess you could say I'm one of those girls
Who's always been with one of those guys
You know the type
Like right now, he sleeps while I write
But it's better than crying
Warn out from trying
From loving a man who always makes it clear
I am not welcome here
Just till he's horney or hungry or needs something clean
You know what I mean
But not tonight
Cause come the morning light, oh


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman in me


Light bulbs buzz, I get up
Head to my drawer
Wish there was more
I could say
Another fairy tale fades to grey
I've lived on hope
Like a child
Walking that mile
Faking that smile
All the while
Wishing my heart had wings
Well from now on I'm gonna be
The kind of woman I'd want my daughter to be, oh


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman


This is me packing up my bags
This is me headed for the door
This is me, the best you ever had


I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me, even if someone can't see
The a stronger woman in me
Gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, no, no
Cause there's a stronger woman, stronger woman
There's a stronger woman, stronger woman in me
Stronger woman in me
