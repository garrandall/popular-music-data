(I feel the big beat...)
(Rock Of Life...)

Big beat talk to me
Waking up blind with the house on fire

Well I pick up my guitar, (I tune up)
I look in the mirror
It's like a stranger in my hand (the baby is crying)
There comes a time when the boy must leave (get up)
And the man has to enter
For the soul to understand (all of the changes)
As if it ain't hard enough this life I'm living in
I was caught with my guard down
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire

Is it something in my head (look up)
Or the time of season
Or the little boy in my hands (must be a reason)
Yeah, there's new meaning in my life (a shake-up)
But there's pain and confusion
And I'm trying to understand (all of the changes)
I've been cut so deep but I can't make it bleed
I was caught with my head in the sand
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire

It ain't no perfect life
This one I'm living in
And I was caught with my guard down
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire
