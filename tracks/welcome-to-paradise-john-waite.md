Sour milk in the saucer
And the cat won't come home
And sometimes new york city
Feels like burnin' rome
I'm lost and I'm crazy
Too much time on my own
I'd give anything to find a heart
That can't be sold
Welcome to paradise
Here is my brave new world
And in my paradise
I'm waiting for a certain girl
Dead flowers in the darkness
Red rose wrapped in lace
Ice-cold vodka tears
Stainin' my face
My heart's growin' colder
And the things I have seen
Won't someone come and get me
Wake me from this dream
Welcome to paradise
Here is my brave new world
And in my paradise
I'm waiting for a special girl
Here in my paradise
I'm waitin' for something new
And here in my brave new world
I'm waitin' for something new
I can hear church bells ringing
White rice hits blue skies

And the blind still lead the blind
As they look for paradise
Oh yeah
Paradise
Welcome to paradise
Here is my brave new world
And here in my paradise
I'm waiting for a special girl
I'm still looking for paradise
In your eyes you seem so far away
And to find paradise
There's no price that I won't pay
(we all find paradise)
I'm still looking for paradise tonight
(we all find paradise)
And I won't find paradise
I'll make it all right
(we all find paradise)
With you and I
Comes into sight
(we all find paradise)
For you and I
For you and I
Paradise could be right
(we all find paradise)
I'm still looking for paradise tonight
(we all find paradise)
And I won't find paradise
I'll make it all right
(we all find paradise)
