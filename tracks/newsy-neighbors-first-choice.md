Talking about those (Newsy neighbors)
Always asking for favors

You always drop by around five
House and home
Soon as your back is turned
They try to get in your home (in your home)
They intrude on your privacy
Oh but they don't give a damn about your or me
What them smile in your company
While they try to cover up their jealousy

Talking about those (Newsy neighbors)
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors

They tell you how to live you life
When they can't even live their own
Minding everybody's affairs
Gossiping on the phone (on the phone)
Borrow money from your cookie jar
But they hoping people come and repossess your car

They tell you what you can and can't afford
Lord instead of getting a caddy they say get a ford

Talking about those (Newsy neighbors)
Newsy
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors

They tell you what you can and can't afford
Instead of getting a caddy they say get a ford

Talking about those (Newsy neighbors)
Newsy
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors (Newsy neighbors)
Always asking for favors

You got them no doubt (Newsy neighbors)
They walk right in (always asking for favors)
Newsy

Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors

Newsy neighbors, newsy neighbors
Newsy neighbors, newsy neighbors

Newsy neighbors
Newsy neighbors
