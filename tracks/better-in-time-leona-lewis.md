It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know

If you didn't notice
You mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it

If you didn't notice
Boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
(no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be
(but I know, but know)
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
Yes, I do
It'll all get better in time

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
Even though I really love you
Gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
