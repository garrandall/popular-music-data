I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss, 
baby taste the moonshinin' off of your lips, 
I want to see that want ya smile, 
still got me hooked been hooked for awhile. 
If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet, 
and an empty spot beside ya in ya bed, 
if you got some room for a little regret, 
let me know girl I've already left

If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up, 
you got my number baby hit me up, 
if you need a little late night pick me up, 
I, hope you get lonely tonight, 
we ain't gotta make up just kiss me, 
we could straight up blame it on the whiskey, 
you ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no, 
I hope you get lonely tonight

I don't care if you're spinnin' in the neon, 
or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on, 
either way the thought is turning me on, 
and I can't shake it girl I'm wide awake, so

If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up, 
you got my number baby hit me up, 
if you need a little late night pick me up, 
I, hope you get lonely tonight, 
we ain't gotta make up just kiss me, 
we could straight up blame it on the whiskey, 
you ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no, 
I hope you get lonely tonight

Hope you get lonely, 
Hope you get lonely, 
Hope you get lonely tonight, 
Girl

If you're feelin' what I'm feel in' let's mix it up, 
you got my number baby hit me up, 
if you need a little late night pick me up, 
I, hope you get lonely tonight, 
we ain't gotta make up just kiss me, 
we could straight up blame it on the whiskey, 
you ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no, 
I hope you get lonely tonight
