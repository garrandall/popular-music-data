I'm gonna have to put you down
You been treating me like a clown
You know you've hurt me once before
You'll never hurt me anymore


Shoo-ee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, a evil bumble bee

I gave you love as sweet as honey
My life, my soul and all my money
You didn't seem to realize
You had a home in paradise


Don't you know I cry
Night after night
Just one kiss before you go
Don't ever come back no more

Now, baby, there's no need of crying
I'm sick and tired of your lying
You know you've hurt my heart again
I'm sorry, baby, it's the end


Now, baby, there's no need of crying
I'm sick and tired of your lying
You know you've hurt my heart again
I'm sorry, baby, it's the end
