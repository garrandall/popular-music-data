Remember hallways, you're waiting always
To see behind the door
You never seen her, you're gonna meet her
The first time so unsure
She smiles your way through a window
You smile right back, she runs away
You wish little girls would sit still
just a little bit longer, longer

And she's still a mystery to me
I thought I'd grow up gracefully
And understand my woman finally
But the more I see
The more I see there is to see, there is to see
And she's still a mystery to me
(She's still a mystery to me)
She's still a mystery to me

I used to wonder when in thunder
Understandin's done
But now I'm graspin' that understandin'
Is only part of love
She'll smile your way through a window
You'll smile right back, she'll run away
You wish little girls would sit still
just a little bit longer, longer

And she's still a mystery to me
I thought I'd grow up gracefully
And understand her finally
But she's a mystery to me
But she's a mystery to me
