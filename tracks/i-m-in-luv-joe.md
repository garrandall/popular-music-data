I'm in luv
Round and round I go
Out of control, I'm in luv
I'm in luv
Round and round I go
Out of control, I'm in luv

Now from the very start
You knew you had my heart
It was plain to see
Ooo, good god almighty
The way you work that body
It was something to remember
And I dance all in this

Imagine you and me
A gentle summer breeze
What a lovely affair
Champagne and candlelights
Romance and moonlights
Girl, I'm no beginner so I hope you're no pretender

I can't deny
Girl, you turn me on
Make me lose my self-control
When you hold me close
I'm in luv
Crazy love
Girl, I must admit it
I am so addicted to your love

What I like
Girl, you've got it
What I need
You give it to me
What I want
Is your sweet loving, baby
