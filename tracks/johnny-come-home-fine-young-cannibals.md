Nobody knows the trouble you feel 
Nobody cares, the feeling is real 

Johnny, we're sorry, won't you come on home 
We worry, won't you come on 
What is wrong in my life 
That I must get drunk every night 
Johnny, we're sorry 

Use the phone, call your mom 
She's missing you badly, missing her son 
Who do you know, where will you stay 
Big city life is not what they say 

Johnny, we're sorry, won't you come on home 
We worry, won't you come on 
What is wrong in my life 
That I must get drunk every night 
Johnny, we're sorry 

You'd better go, everything's closed 
Can't find a room, money's all blown 
Nowhere to sleep, out in the cold 
Nothing to eat, nowhere to go 

Johnny, we're sorry, won't you come on home 
We worry, won't you come on 
What is wrong in my life 
That I must get drunk every night 
Johnny (Johnny), we're sorry, won't you come on home 
We worry, won't you come on home 
Johnny, won't you come on home
