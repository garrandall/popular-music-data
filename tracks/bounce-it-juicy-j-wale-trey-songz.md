Yeah... yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah... I'm 'bout to take yo' girl (bounce it)
Check it...

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Yessir...
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinking different (different)
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant (ig'nant)
She’s strips with the Gs, breaks cash like Li, she got double Ds, and ain’t shit free
Came with my goons but I’m leaving with a diva with an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms, she ain’t finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while I’m getting high as propellers on a helicopter
Let’s do it again, me, you and your friend
We don’t even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup, time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can’t afford to fuck
Bounce it

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Wale though, le'go...
Hands is on her you know what, ’cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast, my pants be on that too much lust
And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced
Throw a block up then I back out, like that, roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack, and a bucket but we nothing but pack
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Mark Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those
Ralph!

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Turn up...
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy, toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl, doin' a tiny line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement, feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt, I’m tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up, I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie, then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin', do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket, keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat
Bounce it

Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

...I’m about to throw a couple thousand
...I’m about to throw a couple thousand
