You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire, yeah,
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight

Baby, I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight

I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

We stared at the sun
And we made a promise
A promise this world
Would never blind us
And these were our words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still believe
If you were in these arms

I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
There's nothing I wouldn't do

And these were our words
They keep me strong, baby

I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms, baby

Like the roses need the rain
Like the seasons need to change
Like a poet needs the pain
I need you in these arms tonight
