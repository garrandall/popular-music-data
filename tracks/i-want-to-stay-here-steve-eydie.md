Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna go to the party with you
I don't wanna go to the dance
I don't wanna go anywhere with you
I just wanna stay here and love you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now that I can be alone with you
I won't throw away the chance
There's no place like home with you
So I wanna stay here and love you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All through the week I miss you so-uh-oh-uh-oh
So now that I've got you I'm gonna hold you
Closer and closer and closer and oh-oh

I don't wanna go for a walk with you
And now that I am in this trance
I don't even know if I'll talk to you
I just wanna stay here and love you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't even know if I'll talk to you
I just wanna stay here and love you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just wanna stay here and love you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
