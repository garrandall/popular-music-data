Hot sun dancin' on the river
We're sittin on the bank and watch the world go by
Our feet in the water she pressed her lips to mine
We were so long on love but short on time
She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild
But she was mine oh, for a little while

And I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

We'd take a ride and head on down to airport road
Put the seats back watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh but I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when
It matters to me now oh but it didn't back then

And I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

I keep seein' pictures now of me and her and those summer nights
My mind fills with her
Oh but it's alright
'Cause I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while
Yeah she was mine for a little while
