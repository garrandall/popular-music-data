Call me when you're down
Call me when you need someone
Call me when it's rough
And you think that there's no one

Love just for the understanding
Things that love carries, what we're demanding
Listen to the heart that's beating
Forget about lust and all misleading
Love, talk about me and you
My love just makes everything come true
Questions lies in the heavens and ground
It's up to me and I'll call you when I'm down

I will be true, too many ups and downs with you
I know what to say to you, so here's what I tell you

But 'till you need someone to love
I will be searching for my love

I will, but I will be there for you

Sitting at a park, holding hands at the dark
With a love so strong to break my heart
This is your heart that's beating
Forget about fuss and all misleading
Love, summer, winter, spring or fall
Love is wishing that we had it all
Questions lies in the skies and ground
It's up to me and I'll call you when I'm down

I will be there for you...

If you need someone
Call me when you're down
If you need someone
Call me when you're down
