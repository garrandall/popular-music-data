You came smiling softly shinin' through,
Easy as a dreamer, into my world
And before I realized the danger
I found myself starin' into your eyes
Somewhere in that cause
I saw promises of things I've never seen before
And it's all over
I've got to have you

I'm holdin' on to (tug?), sayin' nothing,
No-one in the room, I could lose you
Then without a warnin'
I remembered that you trembled at the touch of my hand
Knowing when you came to me
That no-one else ever feels the same in my arms
And it's all over
I've got to have you

Wakin' every mornin'
To the tenderness of holdin' you, asleep, in my arms
Dreamin' while my head was roamin'
Softer than whispers on your cheek, A huh
But I don't know the feelin'
So I don't know if it's love, but it's enough
It's enough, I can't help it
I've got to have you

Ohh it's all over
I've got to have you
