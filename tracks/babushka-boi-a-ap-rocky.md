Uh, they call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep the teeth, no dentures please, princess cuts, no dentist please
Say cheese for the cameras (Aye)
Eight G's for the dancers (Aye)
Benji's in the safe (That's right, aye)
Bentleys or the Phantoms (Uh)
But it all go to waste (Uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
Scar on my face, uh wait

The world is yours, Scarface (Nigga)

I ain't ducking niggas, I ain't ducking bullets either
Shit, I ain't duck sauce since I became vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye Season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place with ya breezy
Prada shades probably why you couldn't see 'em
You shittin' me?

I would like to dedicate to the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe, the world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate to the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe, the world is yours, Scarface

Uh, fuck no this ain't no hookah
Smoking while I'm strolling down Wooster
A buck fifty, my babushka, a pistol, poppers, and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low-top, yeah, the powder-blue ones
Grab a tool, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God

I would like to dedicate to the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe, the world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate to the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe, the world is yours, Scarface

Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive, money, power, that's successful
Money problems, that's expected, marijuana, ass and breasts
Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive, money, power, that's successful
Money problems, that's expected, marijuana, ass and breasts
