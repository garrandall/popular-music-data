I know you heard my reputation (reputation)
You don't think I would ever do right by you (by you)
You think that if you and I was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything I say is straight gang (straight gang)
And to me your just another new name (new name)
But what I'm tryna tell you for every man
theres a woman that'll make him change (him change)
And I believe you the one that'll make me (make me)
But any time I try to show you you shake me (shake me)
I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl I am (I am)
And I aint stoppin right here, I'ma keep going
And I'm gonna make sure everyday that you keep knowing
Whether if I have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the celle-phone for few hours

(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me (like me)
And then the next you don't (don't)
You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know its just sex you want (you want)
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible (incredible)
And every part of your body is so edible (edible)
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that aint the reason why I'm stuck and can't let you go (let you go)
We got a serious serious bond (bond)
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun (but fun)
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
Even though we still young (young)
Just your company aint gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where I'm coming from (coming from)
And if anybody ask me a question about you
Ima tell em you the one
You got me like

And when I think about you
