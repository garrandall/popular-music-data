So close
When I look into your eyes
So close
I feel I'm hypnotized
I wanna stay here
For the rest of my life

So close
When you smile at me that way
So close
It takes my breathe away
I love you more
With every beat of my heart

Oh I remember the night we met
I knew I'd never, ever be the same
Oh I remember the night you said you loved me
In and instant my whole world changed

So close (closer and closer)
Feel your body next to mine
So close (closer and closer)
(closer and closer and closer)
I'll lose a sense of time
I wanna stay here for the rest of my life
I wanna stay here for the rest of my life

Oh I remember the night we met
I knew I never ever be the same
Oh I remember the first time you said you loved me
I love you darling
In an instant my whole world changed

So close (closer and closer)
Being here with you
So close
And there's nothing I'd rather do
Than make you stay here
And I'll keep you always so close

Closer and closer
Come on closer to me boy
