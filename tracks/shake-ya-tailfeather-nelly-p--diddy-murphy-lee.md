We do it for fun, we just do it for fun
Dirty E.A.T, we do it for fun
Bad Boy, we do it for fun
(Nelly, Diddy, Murphy Lee, this is history, baby)
Bend them trucks, we do it for fun
Stack them bucks, we do it for fun
(Come on now)
And the band played on, just like
(I believe you cool to this)
We do it for fun, if you see me, ma
We do it for fun
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go
Hey, girl, what your name is? Where you from?
Turn around, who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging, mama but where your brains at?
(Come on)
I'm still the same cat, when I was young, I was running with Bad Boys
But now I'm older, hope they saw I'm running with Bad Boys
(That's right)
Here come another man unlike no other man
Candy coated, whoa, switching in every lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me?
A thug is we then it's only two G
I like the cocky bow legged ones like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, shake it for Nelly-san
Manolos, ma, no no's, I can't tell
Everybody and their hoochies, when you do it do it well
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Now real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor)
Get that money, honey, act like you know
(Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants
Enter the floor, take it low, girl, do it again
You know I love that
(I love that)
Now where them girls at?
(Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee and Nelly how you love that?
(Shit)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it, player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get to know each other
You the best of the best
And you got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here, mama, you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low, so when you shake it, I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Oh, no, I heard them Bad Boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party 'til them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mike still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type, I like them thick with their mind right
Banging personality conversate when the time right
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, â€½He the manâ€, when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, Popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile because I be about Gs
Keep your women wizzy, man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See, I'm Starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my Rats come in Packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you'd think I was valet parking
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl, go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something, move something
Shake ya tail feather
Oh, no, I heard them Bad Boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party 'til them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mic still on
(Man)
