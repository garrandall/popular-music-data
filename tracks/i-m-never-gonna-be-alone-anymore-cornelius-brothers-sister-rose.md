Oh, love
So glad I found you
I thought my life would always be blue

I didn't know love
(Didn't know love could be this way)
Could be this way
(Didn't know love could be this way)
I want you, oh my love
To always stay

It must be love
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
Since I met you

I used to stay locked up in my room, yeah
All alone with just my gloom
(All alone with just my gloom)
Then you came into my life
(Then you came into my life)
And gave me feelings of such delight

It must be love
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
Since I met you

It must be love
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
I'm never gonna be alone anymore
Since I met you

It must be love
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
I'm never gonna be
