Friend, don't take her
Please don't take her
Love away from me

I'm begging you, friend
Don't take her
She's everything in life
I'll ever need

She is life
When I want to live
She's everything to me
In life that life can give

She's my water
When I need a drink
She's the first thought
In my mind each time
I try to think

And I say, friend
Don't take her
Please don't take her
Love away from me

I'm begging you, friend
Don't take her
She's everything in
Life I'll ever need

She's my fingers
When I want to feel
She's the only thing in life
To me that's really real

She is love
She's all the love I know
She could kiss the
Ground in wintertime
And make a flower grow

Don't take her
Please don't take her
Please don't take her
She's all I got...

I'm begging you, friend
Don't take her
She's everything in life to me
She is my life

She's my love
She's my fingers
When I want to feel...
