(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
(Do-lang-do-lang)
He's so fine
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Wish he were mine
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
That handsome boy over there
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
The one with the wavy hair
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
I don't know how I'm gonna do it
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
But, I'm gonna make him mine
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
He's the envy of all the girls
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
It's just a matter of time
(Do-lang-do-lang)

He's a soft-spoken guy
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Also, seems kinda shy
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Makes me wonder if I
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Should even give him a try?
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
But then I know he can't shy
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
He can't shy away forever
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
And, I'm gonna make him mine
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
If it takes me forever
(Do-lang-do-lang)

He's so fine
(Oh, yeah)
Gotta be mine
(Oh, yeah)
Sooner or later
(Oh, yeah)
I hope it's not later
(Oh, yeah)
We got to get together
(Oh, yeah)
The sooner, the better
(Oh, yeah)
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
To be held in his arms

If I were a queen
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
And, he asked me to leave my throne
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
I'd do anything that he asked
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Anything to make him my own
(Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)

For he's so fine
(So fine)
So fine
(So fine)
So fine
(So fine)
So fine
(So fine)
So fine
(So fine)
Oh, yeah
(So fine)
So fine
