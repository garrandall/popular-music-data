Oh, yeah, one time for me
Do it

Do it to me now
Do it to me now
Do it, do it, do it
Do it to me now
Yeah, yeah

Can't say nothin'
Say nothin'
You know everything
I'm talking about

No need to claim it to myself
When you know everything
Coming out of my mouth
I can't say nothin'

But if you do me wrong all the time
It won't take too long
You put a spell on me
Imagine if you could see

Just don't make me do my thing
It can be so hard for me
Let me give you love
Let me give you love

Can't say nothin'
