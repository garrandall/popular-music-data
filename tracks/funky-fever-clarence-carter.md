There's a thing that's going around
Everybody's getting it, y'all
And it's getting them down
Oh, yes, it is

It's called funky (funky)
Funky (funky) funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)

It's funky this and funky funky that
If you ain't funky, y'all
You ain't where it's at
Oh, no, you ain't

Talking bout funky (funky)
Funky (funky) funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)

There's a little town
And it ain't L.A
They got a funky little girl
In the funky cafe

She got some funky, funky food
That's way out of sight
A funky little band
That rocks all night

Wilson Pickett got it
Down on Funky Broadway
You can't get around it
Funky fever's here to stay
Yes, it is

Talking bout funky (funky)
Funky (funky) funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)

Y'all stand back
While I do the funkaloo
Doing all right
Can I hear it from the voices

(We got a funky beat)
Y'all sure funky tonight
(We got a funky beat)
Can I get it from the band

Serve some funk up, y'all

Started in New York
Moved to L.A
Spread it to Chicago
And now it's headed this way
Yes, it is

Talking bout the funky (funky)
I mean funky (funky) funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)

Funky fever (funky, funky fever)
That's what's going around
(Funky, funky fever)
Funky, funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)
That's what everybody's putting out

(Funky, funky fever)
The funky, funky fever
(Funky, funky fever)
I like it, I like.....
