Now we kiss goodbye
You'll be off to war, the battle's on
I don't wanna cry as I stand
And watch your ship sail on
Now when you're out to sea
And the sky is dark and water surrounds you
And your heart just won't be
'Cause you feel as if our loneliness will drive you


Forget me not, boy
Let my love comfort you
Comfort you and see you through
Forget me not, boy
Lock my memory in your heart
And we'll never be apart


Remember Old Joe's
Our favorite song, our table for two
Well, heaven knows
These little things I'll share with no one but you
Wherever you are
No land and sea and time will divide us
No matter how far
Back to each others arms our love's gonna guide us


Forget me not, boy
Write a letter every day
Don't throw my picture away
Forget me not, boy
Let my love within you burn
I'll be here when you return


Each night I will pray
For peace on earth, goodwill to all men
And my little heart will say
These tender words time and time again


Forget me not, boy
Let my love within you burn
I'll be here when you return
Forget me not, boy
Lock my memory in your heart
And we'll never be apart


Forget me not, boy
