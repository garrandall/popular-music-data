Well count (doo wop doobie doo) every star

Count every star in the midnight sky
Count every rose every firefly
For that's how many times I miss you
Heaven knows
I miss you

Count every leaf on a willow tree
Count every wave on a stormy sea
Count every star and darling when you do
You'll know the times
I cried for you

Count every star in the starry sky
Count every rose every firefly
For that's how many times I miss you
Heaven knows
I miss you

Count every leaf on a willow tree
Run every wave (doobie doo) -y sea
Count every star and darling when you do
You'll know the times
I cried
For you
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
