I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home
Worries on my mind, afraid of what I'll find
Will my family be gone? I'm afraid to go home
Back to Tennessee, afraid of what I'll see

As I walk down this dusty road, got a heart with a heavy load
Ain't one thing that's the same, so much sorrow and pain
Headin' home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile
Ain't heard nobody sing, ain't seen one livin' thing

Someone's waitin' for me, honey sweet as candy
Wanna hold her tightLord, make her be all right
Maybe 'round on next bend, all the ashes of land
Valleys will be green instead of what I've seen

I'm afraid for the scrubby pine, for the sweet honeysuckle vine
I'm afraid for my home, for the fields that I roamed
Kick along down a homeward road, and your heart's gotta take the load
I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home

Sherman's been in my town, burned it all to the ground
Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea
Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea
