Honey honey, how you thrill me
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me
Ah-hah, honey honey

I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey honey, let me feel it
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it
Ah-hah, honey honey

The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing
When you do your thing

I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, touch me, baby
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me, baby
Ah-hah, honey honey

You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least
You're a doggone beast

So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, how you thrill me
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me
Ah-hah, honey honey

I heard about you before
(I heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Oh you make me dizzy

Honey honey, how you thrill me...
