I've got a man who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love him
Yes, I love him

I'm gonna walk up to his gate
See if I can get this thing straight
'Cause I want him
And I'm gonna have him

Say is you is, or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
It seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A man is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find he's gone and made a change

Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

I guess my baby's found somebody new
And I'd better get right up and go out and find me somebody, too
I said I'm gonna find me somebody, too
