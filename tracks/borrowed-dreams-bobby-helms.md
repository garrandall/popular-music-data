You said you loved me
It all seemed so true
But then so brightly
The dawn came into view

And brought tomorrow
Then you were not there
For I'm a fool who borrows dreams
That get nowhere (that get nowhere)

In the magic of my dreams
(Magic of my dreams)
I had you all to myself
(Had you to myself)
While in reality (in reality)
You're loving someone else

I weep in sorrow
It's more than I can bear
For I'm a fool (I'm a fool)
Who borrows dreams
That get nowhere

(In the magic of my dreams)
(I had you all to my myself)
While in reality
You're loving someone else

I weep in sorrow
It's more than I can bear
For I'm a fool (I'm a fool)
Who borrows dreams
That get nowhere
