You know, you, you make me feel so good inside, heh
I always wanted a girl like you, such a P.Y.T, Pretty Young Thing, oh!


Where did you come from, baby?
And, oh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tendoroni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me


Don't you know, now is the perfect time?
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Just let me take you to the max


I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there, oh, oh
I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there


Anywhere you wanna go


Yes, I will


Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin' honey
Come set me free


But don't you know, now is the perfect time?
We can dim the lights just to make it right
In the night, hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got


I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there


Pretty Young Things, repeat after me
Say na na na na


Na na na


Na na na na


(Na na na na)


Na na na


Na na na na


Say na na na na


Na na na na, na, na


Oh, I'll take you there, take you there


I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
And I'll take you there
Take you there, take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T)
Pretty Young Thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C)
Tender lovin' Care
I'll Take You There
Take you there, oh

Oh! (P.Y.T)
Oh, baby (T.L.C)
Oh, baby
Oh, darling
Oh, you know, I think it would be real nice if we (P.Y.T)
You and I could, uh, just get together (T.L.C)
You're such a P.Y.T to me
Pretty Young Thing
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, darling (P.Y.T)
Oh, baby (T.L.C)
