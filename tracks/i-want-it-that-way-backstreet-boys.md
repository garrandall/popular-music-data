Yeah


You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way


Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way


Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way


Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way


Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me


You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)


Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way


Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (Don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way


'Cause I want it that way
