Yeah baby, this ain't no remix here

Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me

JoJo, show them what you got 
Don't wanna get sexy baby if you don't wanna get nasty
Maybe we can compromise and both get a little bit freaky
And slide right over here and let me rub that body
Maybe you would like it, girl it might get you in the mood-gee yeah

Let's go through the motions, baby
(Let's go through the motions, baby)
Let's go through the motions, baby
(Every night and every day)
Let's go through the motions, baby
(Yeah, yeah)
Let's go through the motions, baby
(Yeah)

Yo, this is a new Jodeci format, baby
K-Ci step to the mic

So won't you tell me do you like it, girl
'Cause I love how you move around
Let's take it to the floor, lady let's move up and down
We don't have to do such, lady let's just make the sound
So tell me girls are ya with me and all of us could get down

Let's go through the motions, baby
(Tell me girls are ya with me)
Let's go through the motions, baby
(Tell me are ya with me)
Let's go through the motions, baby
(I wanna, I wanna know now)
Let's go through the motions, baby

Mr. Dal, you up next
Yo, I be damma' in ya slamma'  baby check my gramma'
And I go long 'cause Mr. Dalvin got stamina
And I be hittin skins, makin' ends

But your man couldn't touch me by the hairs on my chinny chin, nigga
I fake a freak I'm not faking the fuckin' freak
(My style is under cover)
No cummin' on my sheets, so hit me up or we will 

Yes, I wrecks it, I checks it, I gets butt naked, hey
So be my baby baby baby yo, next I flex
Put hickeys on her neck I zoom at more boom than Wrecks n EFX
Jodeci sing

It won't be long we can go home
If you wanna go home I say it won't
I'll say it again it won't be long if you wanna moan
'Cause you look so sexy, baby you really turn me on, oh

Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Let's go through the motions, baby
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
All night long

Let's go through the motions, baby
We could take it to the floor
Let's go through the motions, baby
Oh, up and down
Let's go through the motions, baby
Feel you all around

Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me

Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me

Let's go through the motions, baby
I love the way you scream, girl
Let's go through the motions, baby, yeah
let's go through the motions, baby, oh

Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me

Let's go through the motions, baby
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you wanna pump, do you wanna pump wit me
Do you want it, do you want it

Let's go through the motions, baby
Do you need it, do you need it
Let's go through the motions, baby
Let's go through the motions, baby
Come on, come on baby
