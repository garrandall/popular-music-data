Oh, yeah

She's got a certain way about her
I don't think I could go
A day without her love
It's on the rise

Just like the morning sun
She gets me up
And the feeling's good
It lets me know I can't compromise

I tell you, there's
Different strokes for different folks
But for me, there's only one girl

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
And she's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
And she's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind, yeah

She makes it so nice on a rainy day
All of the clouds just go away
Her smile is shining bright

And every little single opportunity
I try to let her know
That she's the one for me
She's such a pretty sight

I tell you, there's
Different strokes for different folks
And for me, there's only one girl

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
And she's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
Oh, my baby's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind, no, no, no

Oh, she makes me happy
She gives me all the love that I need
And makes it snappy
She's my sunshine

When I'm feeling down
I just look around for my sunshine
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
And she's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah

She's my sunshine (she's my sunshine)
Oh, my baby's so fine (and she's so fine)
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind

She makes every day
So bright in my world
(She's my sunshine)
She makes feel, oh, so bright
My girl (she's my sunshine)
