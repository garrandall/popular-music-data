Oh, let him love me
When we kiss
Let the fire start

Let him want me
The way that I want him
With all my heart

This is my prayer
My only prayer
When the night comes
And all is still

On my pillow
This is my prayer
That he will care

That he will care
When I need him
He will be there
Though it be cloudy or fair

Oh, let him love me
When we kiss
Let the fire start

And let him want me
The way that I want him
With all my heart

This is my prayer
My silent prayer
Oh, I wish for on every star
May his arms be never too far

When I awake (when I awake)
For my finger (on her finger)
His ring to wed (my ring to wed)

This is my prayer
(This is my prayer)
My prayer
