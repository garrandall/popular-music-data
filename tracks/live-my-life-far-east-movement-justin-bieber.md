I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright


Yo, hell yeah, dirty bass
Ghetto girl, you drive me cray
Hell yeah, dirty bass
Yo, yo

This beat make me go wow (go wow)
This drink make me fall down (fall down)
I party hard like carnival
Let's burn this mother down
This bass make me go ache (go ache)
These girls Cirque du soleil (soleil)
You're that telly cake with a Cali shake
I got dough, who's down to bake

Oh my, dirty bass
Oh you got it like that
I can work that back
Let me get that
(get your ass on the floor)
Oh my, dirty bass
Oh you got that small
I can break that off
Let me get that
(get your ass on the floor)


I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright

I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright

Wo-oh oh, wo-oh oh,
I know that we gon' be alright
Wo-oh oh, wo-oh oh
I know that we gon' be alright


Yo, hell yeah, dirty bass
Ghetto girl, you drive me cray
Hell yeah, dirty bass

No matter where we be at VIP, or in the C-lac
All we need to start it is the speakers in my chit-chat
I spot a couple hotties
Holla, we're the party, we that
Girl move it like Pilates
Put your head where you knee at

Oh my, dirty bass
Oh you got it like that
I can work that back
Let me get that
(get your ass on the floor)
Oh my, dirty bass
Oh you got that small
I can break that off
Let me get that
(get your ass on the floor)


I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright

I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright


This is my moment tonight
Hell yeah we doing it right
So get your hands up in the air
Like you living your life
This is my moment tonight
Hell yeah we doing it right
So get your hands up in the air
Like you living your life

Like you living your life
Li-like you living your life
Like you living your life


I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight (party tonight)
I'm gonna li-li-live my life (my life)
I know that we gon' be alright

Wo-oh oh, wo-oh oh
I know that we gon' be alright
Wo-oh oh, wo-oh oh
I know we gon' be alright (we gon be alright)
