All right now, get your ears lowered down to the speakers
So you can understand what I'm talking about
You know it seems like no matter where we go to play a concert at
There's one thing that remains constant
From the beginning to the very end of the show
You can always count on about one hundred to five hundred people
Down at the very front row screaming one word
At the top of their lungs... Boogie!
And sometimes, the feeling prevails upon 'em so hard, beloved
But they just have to mount up on the stage
And get to giggin' with the band
And when they do, uh-oh, here comes the security fuzz
And the scene is something like this
Hey you guys are really good, man. I dig up on you guys
When you gon' play 'Smokin' In The...' Ow! Ow! Ow!
Man, you made me drop my bottle of wine on the floor
Say, there you go
So we're gonna dedicate this song to everybody listening
Because the ones that get into it
Are definitely, the kings of the party!

Every Friday night there's a concert in their town
You know they all get together and they're ready to party down
An ol' Brownsville Station really diss 'em, 'cause they get it on
You see the chicks they all go crazy, oh when the band begins to play
And the guys make so much noise, they scare all the cops away
But together we start to change the show into a rock 'n' roll holiday

We're the kings of the party, we're the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, aw come on, and slip me five
Now we're the kings of the party, 'cause we're the baddest people alive

Ten thousand eyes watching while we leave the floor
Ten thousand tongues screaming more and more
And there were fifteen hundred still waiting outside the door

So we're the kings of the party, the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, c'mon and slip me five
Now we're the kings of the party, 'cause we're the baddest people alive

We're the kings of the party, the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, come down down on and slip me five
We're the kings, the kings of the rock 'n' roll party
'Cause we get it on

We're the kings of the party, we're the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, aw come on, and slip me five
Now we're the kings of the party, 'cause we're the baddest people alive
