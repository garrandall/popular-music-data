Bring the beat in


Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away


Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first


Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top


Oh come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Oh come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top


Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again


Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first


Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top


Oh baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Oh come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top


Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
