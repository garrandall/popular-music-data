New York City
We got another one
Tory Lanez the don
Whole Umbrella in here
Coscto baby
Nyce B

She better know that we fuckin' when I come through
I ain't with the cuffin' when I come through
I ain't with the buggin' when I come through
She know I'm straight thuggin' when I come through
Tell me what's love, when I need that
Pull it down for me shawty, lemme see that
Do that thang thang, yeah you fucking right
Leave your nigga back, I'm tryna fuck tonight
You still on the down low
Still creep on your boy, still freak on the down low
You know what I'm round for
I done came round to see you drop down on me
Do it slowly
Buss it all open like you got a slow leak
I've been in the streets with three or four freaks
She is so bad might need a police
Stomach on flat, ass so beast
Walk oh how the fuck you got in those jeans
I just wanna touch ya, fuck ya OD
Know you got a man but this is lowkey

What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
(What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe)
What's love, it's about us, it's about trust, babe
(We're supposed to be about each other)
What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
(What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe)
What's love, it should be about us, it should be about trust babe
(We're supposed to be about each other)


And I got two different girls on me
It ain't easy, to get em off me
'Cause I pull up in that light foreign
Shawty you see me, you can't ignore it
I ain't fucking with you dumb broads, got my dawgs, get em off
There's a lot of bad bitches I done pissed off, did wrong, dipped off
Still a nigga mean with the wrist
She gon' take it off, course she ain't with the shits
That's your girlfriend but she ain't give a shit
Clean in this bitch and the watch on my wrist cost a key and a brick
What's love got to do with it
I could show you just what to do with it
Come through, I'm a let you get it
And you know what I do with...


What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
(What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe)
What's love, it's about us, it's about trust, babe
(We're supposed to be about each other)
What's love, got to do, got to do with it, babe
(What's love, what's love, what's love if you got it for me babe)
What's love, it should be about us, it should be about trust babe
(We're supposed to be about each other)
