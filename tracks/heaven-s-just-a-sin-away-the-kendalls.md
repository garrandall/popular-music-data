Heaven's just a sin away oh, whoa
Just a sin away
I can't wait another day
I think I'm givin' in

Though I'd love to hold you tight
Oh, whoa
Be with you tonight
But that still won't make it right
'cause I belong to him

Oh, way down deep inside
I know that it's all wrong
Your eyes keep tempting me
And I never was that strong- ong

Oh, devil's got me now
Oh, whoa gone and got me now
I can't fight him anyhow
I think he's gonna win

Heaven's just a sin away
Oh, whoa
Just a sin away
Heaven help me when I say
I think I'm givin' in lead

Heaven's just a sin away
Oh, whoa
Just a sin away

I can't wait another day
I think I'm givin' in
Though I'd love to hold you tight
Oh whoa
Be with you tonight
But that still won't make it right 'cause I belong to him
