Bright lights, grey skies, city arcades
Hidden in the shadows of fire escapes
Sour tongues, purple lungs, lighters in the air
Oh I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare

Cheap talks, bitter hearts, all behind your back
Anything for the fame in a span of a snap
Over-filtered self-portraits, vanity fair
Does anybody care, does anybody care

Under the influence
Just trying to be relevant

Blinded by
Human Eyes
Couldn't see past the present hype
Blinded by
Human Eyes, human cries, human minds

Deep breath, restless where do I begin
Run, hide, hitch hike, stained blood red
Nothing's sacred, love is wasted hands up in the air, it's all so unfair, it's all so unfair

Deeply deceived
Fighting to get on my knees

Blinded by
Human Eyes
Couldn't see past the present hype
Blinded by
Human Eyes, human cries, human minds

Human Eyes

I am empty
I am empty to the bone
Won't you fill me
I am tired of being alone

I am empty
I am empty to the bone
Won't you fill me
Won't you fill me

I wanna see the unseen
Sing what's never sung before
Revel on the mysteries
Be able to trust the unknown
Fill me up so I can know
Though I'm

Blinded by
Human eyes
I see past the present hype
Blinded by
Human eyes, human cries, human minds
