Whoa, I'm missing you
The hurt on your heart
Through your eyes it shows
The past can't relive
What we both know

Still I remember
Things I never meant
Memories surround me
Won't let me forget

I was so wrong
The secret's not worth keeping
I had no faith
That you would still believe

No, now
My heart's in your keeping
Here I am
Missing you
(Missing you)

Fear in the dark
Stares from my wall
Your eyes in your picture
Won't let me go
If I could remember
How you felt the pain
The king of pretenders
Alone in shame

I was so wrong
The secret's not worth keeping
I had no faith
That you would still believe

No, now
My heart's in your keeping
Here, I am
Oh here I am
(Missing you)
Missing you

Oh, I'm missing you
You were there
Now I'm here
You gave much more than I did
I gave what I had to give
If I could, you know I would
I'd make it up to you
Instead I'm missin' you

In the place you used to be
You were lying next to me
Oh, I'm missing you
Whoa, I'm missing you
