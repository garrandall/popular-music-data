Hey
Yeah

When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
And when they played I'd sing along
It made me smile, yeah

Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wonder where they've gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I love so well and every

Sha-la-la-la
(Oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa
(Whoa, whoa)
Sha-la-la-la
(Let it shine)

Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That we started to sing, so fine

When they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It could really make me cry
Just like before it's yesterday once more, mmm

Looking back on how it was
And years gone by
The good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed, oh

And it was the songs
Of love that I would sing to you then
I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound good to me
As they melt the years away and every

Sha-la-la-la
(Oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa
(Whoa, whoa)
Sha-la-la-la
(Let it shine)

Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That we started to sing, so fine

Oh, when they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It could really make me cry
Just like before it's yesterday once more, girl

Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Nothing remains the same
(Whoa, no)
Life is a constant change

I'm looking back on what used to be
(For me)
Uh-huh and how it affected me
(It feels)
Do you remember the way
You showed me love?

Oh, I'm looking back on the love we made
(Our love)
It wasn't a masquerade
(Oh, no)
It was a long, a long time ago
Don't you know?

Nothing remains the same
(Nothing remains the same)
Life is a constant change
(Whoa, whoa)

Nothing remains the same
(Everything in time's got to change)
Life is a constant change

Oh, I'm looking back on what used to be
(For me)
And what you meant to me, girl
(Oh, hoo)
We both, we both never thought it never end

And I'm looking back and it's nice to be
(So nice)
So filled with the memories
(Of you)
Of all the love, all the love we shared
In the past and oh, no

Nothing remains the same
(Nothing remains the same)
Life is a constant change
(Every day, every way)

Nothing remains the same
(Life keeps on turning around)
Life is a constant change
(And every)

Sha-la-la-la
(Every)
Whoa, whoa
(Still shines)
Sha-la-la-la
(Oh, yes, it does)

Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
(Shing-a-ling-a-ling)
We started to sing, so fine, oh, it was

When they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It really makes me cry
Just like before it's yesterday

Sha-la-la-la
(Oh, yes, it does)
Whoa, whoa
(I remember it so well)
Sha-la-la-la
(Oh, yeah)

Whoa, whoa
(I could still feel a chill down my spine)
Shing-a-ling-a-ling, we started to sing
Every time

Oh, when they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It really makes me cry
Just like before it's yesterday

Sha-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
(Well, well)
Shing-a-ling-a-ling
(Every shing-a-ling-a-ling )
We started to
