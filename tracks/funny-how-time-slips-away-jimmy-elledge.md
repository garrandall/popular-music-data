Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'?
Oh, I guess I'm doin' fine

It's been so long now
And it seems that
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin' fine
Heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time

Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away

Gotta go now
Guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town

But I remember what I told you
That in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprisin' how time slips away
