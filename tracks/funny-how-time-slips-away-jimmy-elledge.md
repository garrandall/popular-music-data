Well, hello there
My it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Well, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long nowm, but it seems now
That it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away?
How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you'll love him 'til the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away?
Got to go now
I guess that I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you
That in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips away
It's been so long now, but it seems now
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away?
Ain't it funny how time slips away?
