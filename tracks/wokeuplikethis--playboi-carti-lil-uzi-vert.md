Know I got a lot, lot

I'm a rockstar, know I got a lot, lot
I'm a rockstar


Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me

Oh, I think they like me, yeah they like me
Diamonds on me ice cream, hoe that's lightly
My draco bitch a spike lee, diamonds on me biting
I heard these niggas wanna fight me
Meet me at my next show but you better bring a pipe B
We ain't fighting, I bet she like me, exciting, so exciting
Fuck me, Bentley coupe I'm riding with a thottie, fuck
I just spent a 100 on my watch piece, fuck
I done fell in love with a thottie, fuck
She just wanna fuck me for my clout, fuck
Bitch I'm off the lean I crash the Audi, fuck
Might be spend 200 on this Audi, truck

Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me


Oh I think they like me, in my white tee
Oh no no no baby smoke so much dope need some Visine
These young nigga don't like me, but I just like
"Fuck all of your bitches so at they parties don't invite me"
That bitch that's your wifey, she so trifflin'
I been getting money so ain't nothing really excite me
Carti poured a 6 in the 4 off the right lean
Damn that boy, ask her for some more like the Sprite clean
That's that dirty, that's that dirty
That girl all up in my face like she ain't try to swerve me
These boys all up in my lane I swear they keep on merging
No I cannot see a lame cause my Rolls Royce got curtains


Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me

Oh I think they like me, yeah she like me
The bitch want to indict me, she can't find me
I'm like dirty up the Sprite please, with some ice please
With my bitch like to sip lean, oh oh
Xans, percs, molly, we got hella things
I'm in love with the guap, gave it a wedding ring
And I swear I had these thots before I had the fame
And I swear I had the Glock before I had got the chain
I'm in Bompton with Pirus and I don't even bang
Shoutout G Weed and Yung L, yo hoe that the gang
Shoutout GiGi that's my boo, she know that I claim
Shootin' at these niggas like I'm in the paint
Woke up like this

Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
