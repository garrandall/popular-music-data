Okay, look, uh
Tropical flow, you want smoke, we palm trees
I'm a dog, got fleas, at the mall, cop a fleece
In the mood for some becky, might call up yo' niece
And she bruise both knees, better watch how you speak
I got too many kills to go chill on the beach
Got too many skills, on they hill is defeat
And the blood cover me like a blanket of 

But been in the field like some worn-out cleats
It's game time, pussy, don't shit where we eat
Got no time to play footsie with bitches on me
Know the boy sick like his face lookin' green
Don't get carried away by the wind like a leaf
Opps wanna eat but they can't, it's a feast
No love on this side, get a bullet for peace
Act like a fruit, that's the moment we squeeze
Get turnt to a vegetable, nigga, some peas
Piss on the pavement and smash in your teeth
That's a line in the sand we gon' draw for the week
Off-top, no cap, only wavin' the beam
Like a piccolo, play me, now when do you leave?
Make a hole in your stomach like Dragon Ball Z
I got too many  on me
Drip out the flood like he came from the sea
Run out of time then I cop an AP
I been too invest with my following, please
Y'all niggas just stans, call us on the tea
And I argue with fans on the TL with ease
I fuck off the Xan, now I'm spillin' the tea
The Glock in my hand, let it smoke like a Jeep
The money in my pocket a marketing fee
Let this.22 caliber tickle your cheek


Okay, look, uh
Tropical flow, you want smoke, we palm trees
I'm a dog, got fleas, at the mall, cop a fleece
In the mood for some becky, might call up yo' niece
And she bruise both knees, better watch how you speak
I got too many kills to go chill on the beach
Got too many skills, on they hill is defeat (Yah, yah)
And the blood cover me like a blanket of  (Ayy)


Fuck it, we ain't done yet
Sticks in the house gettin' built like Jack
My Asian shooter keep that Virginia Tech
If he dissin' the gang then it's off with his neck
Puttin' my dick in the woman that birthed you
It make me laugh 'cause I know that it hurt you
Louis V drip, I'm on FaceTime with Virgil
Like a sea bear, nigga, you outside my circle
I pull up with the stick 'cause I know you ain't ready
In my palm tree shirt like I'm Tommy Vercetti
My clip started out full, when I saw you it emptied
And yo, y'all with the chop like I'm trimming the hedges
Way I'm surgery sharp, Edward Scissorhands
Yo' bitch say she hungry, I'm feedin' her dick again
Get the pack from the island, we smokin' on Gilligan
And I freestyled this verse, you can tell how I'm punchin' in
It's a D.C. sniper, shoot through the peephole
Runnin' the game like I move with a cheat code
True life, I'm addicted to free coke
That bitch say that sing so I know that she deepthroat
Now I'm cashin' a check, my block is a bustdown
See this AR? This hoe finna bust down
Like it's takin' a shit, this hoe finna dump out
Yeah, it's Kami and Fukkit, you know that you fucked now


Okay, look, uh
Tropical flow, you want smoke, we palm trees
I'm a dog, got fleas, at the mall, cop a fleece
In the mood for some becky, might call up yo' niece
And she bruise both knees, better watch how you speak
I got too many kills to go chill on the beach
Got too many skills, on they hill is defeat
And the blood cover me like a blanket of
