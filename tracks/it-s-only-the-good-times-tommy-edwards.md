It's only the good times I remember
Whenever I think of you
It's strange but you know
I can't remember
The tears and heartaches with you

It's nights like those nights
We'd sit home talking
Oh, my, how the hours flew
It's those tender times
That I remember
Whenever I think of you

Although we were wrong for each other
We still had thrills just the same
And I guess that we'll always wonder
Which of us was to blame

I can't say that sometimes I'm not sorry
To think that our love is through
Cause it's the only good times I remember
Whenever I think of you

Do you (do you) remember too
