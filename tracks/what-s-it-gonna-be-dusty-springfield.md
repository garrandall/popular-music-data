What's it gonna be?
Please tell me
Is it really me?
Please tell me
Are you out for fun?
Only lovin' on the run
And leave me cryin', ahh, cryin'

What's it gonna be?
(Tomorrow)
Will he set me free?
(Tomorrow)
Gotta know for sure
A broken heart don't have a cure
It just keeps hurting, ahh, hurtin'
And when I'm hurtin'
I can't stop hurtin'

I want a love that's here to stay
Baby please
The kind of love that I can count on everyday

Ah, got a hold on me
You know it
What's it gonna be?
You know it

Want a love that's so
But I'll turn around and go
'Cause I can't take it 
I can't take it
I can't face it
My heart won't make it

I want a love that's here to stay
Baby, believe me
The kind of love that I can count on everyday, mmm

(What's it gonna be?)
Mmm, tell me
(What's it gonna be?)
Baby, tell me
(What's it gonna be?)
Come on, baby
(What's it gonna be?)
Hey, hey, you gotta tell me 
What's it gonna be?
