You and I been goin' steady for over a year
And then we suddenly started feelin' like the end was near
My love is dyin', well, I can't hide it
I'm sorry, honey, but I wanna rock

I saw a real fine girl at the marketplace
She had a nice way of walkin' and a real fine face
A voice like a man, I don't understand
I'm sorry, Jake, but it's my mistake

Well, it's my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
Yes, it's my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
Aw, get it right now, honey

I had to choose between school and a rock 'n' roll band
I made up my mind to rock as fast as I can
I don't want no teachers or their rules
You got it right, I'm nobody's fool

But you can't trust nobody like you trust your dog
Too many people got a smile then they lie like a log
It's hard to place an honest face
I'm sorry, honey, but it's my mistake

Well, it's my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
Yes, it's my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
Oh, my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh
My (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
Well, it's my (my), my (my), my (my), my mistake
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh, my, my
