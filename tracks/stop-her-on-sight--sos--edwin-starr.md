Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S

I'm sending out an S.O.S
Because I'm in so much distress
So if you see my baby
If you see my baby
Stop her on sight

Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S

I'm gonna tell the F.B.I
I'm likely to get myself a secret spy
Because I lost my baby
So if you see my baby
Stop her on sight

You can tell her by the way she walks
You can tell her by the way she talks
You can tell her by the way she smiles
I guarantee you it will drive you wild
So if you see my baby
If anybody sees my baby
Stop her on sight

Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sending out an S.O.S
