Darling, you've made me
Change my mind
I can't leave you
Leave you behind

I'm gonna bring it to you
Bring my sweet loving
Bring it on home to you
Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

I heard you laughing
When I left
So now you know
You only hurt yourself

But I'm gonna bring it to you
Bring my sweet loving
Bring it on home to you
Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

Don't want your jewelery or money too
And nothing else, nothing else
You said you would do

I'm just gonna bring it to you
Bring my sweet loving
Bring it on home to you
Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

You said you'd always be my slave
Till you were buried
Buried in your grave
But you got a little time yet

And I'm gonna bring it to you
Bring my sweet loving
Gonna bring it on home to you
Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

You said you'd try to treat me right
But it was you who stayed out
You stayed out late at night
But I forgive you

And bring it to you
Bring my sweet loving
Bring it on home to you
Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

Yeah (yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah...
