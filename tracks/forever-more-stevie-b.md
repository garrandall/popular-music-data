Je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, I'll do anything for you
'Cause you that made my dream come true
And I'd really like to know you better

When I looked into your eyes
It took me by surprise
All I saw was love and emotion
Girl, let's run away
Just you and I today
Girl, I want your total devotion

Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby

Baby, there's nothing like kissing you
That's all I really want to do
Girl, you're like a priceless treasure

When I'm holdin' you so close
Is what I like the most
Girl, you know you turn me on, baby
I know your love is real
'Cause girl, I know the deal
I just want your love and devotion

Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby

When I'm sittin' all alone and I'm thinkin' of you, girl
Won't you believe it when I tell you that I love you, girl
What can I do to make it last forever

Girl, I only wanna be with you

When I looked into your eyes
It took me by surprise
All I saw was love and emotion
Girl, let's run away
Just you and I today
Girl, I want your total devotion

Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby

When I'm sittin' all alone and I'm thinkin' of you, girl
Won't you believe it when I tell you that I love you, girl
What can I do to make it last forever, girl
I'm sittin' all alone, I'm sit-sit-sit, I'm sittin' all alone, sit-sit-sit

Remember I love you, girl
I'll be there for you, baby
Oh, yeah, hey, yeah

Let me love you, girl, forever more (I'll be there for you, baby)
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more (Oh, wanna live my life lovin' you)
I love you, baby

Let me love you, girl, forever more (Forever more, forever more, baby)
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more (I'll do anything for you, baby, yeah)
I love you, baby
