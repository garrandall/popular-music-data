My best friend came from the other side of town
We followed our own rule and we loved to run around
On those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights

I was short and funny
She was tall and lean
We were the strangest pair of women
That old town had ever seen
On those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights

We were feeling good, we were feeling Ok
Nothing but love on our minds
I would go back now and do it all again
Those were the happiest times

We cruised the boulevard in a fancy open car
I never knew how she got it cause we never got that far
On those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights

Wearing roses and lace‚ Purfume and jewels
The crowded streets were boiling but we never lost our cool
On those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights

We were feeling good‚ we were feeling Ok
Nothing but love on our minds
I would go back now and do it all again
Those were the happiest times

Now the in-crowd was hot they was hanging down by the shore
We'd be at the arcade just trying to raise the score
You'd take Johnny‚ I'll take Joe
If we change midstream no one will ever know
On those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights

Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Oh oh
Those long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
Oh oh
Those long, long hot summer nights
Those long hot summer nights
