I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby

Moonlit sky casts shadows down
Romance in the air is strong

Something's telling me
I need your love

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact
I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?

Looking glass reflects the moon
Your love's missing from this room

Baby, now I see
I need your love

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact
I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?

I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact
I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?

Oh, I need your love
I need you tonight
Can't do without
Oh, I need your love

Oh, I need your love
So I can hug
And squeeze you tight
Oh, I need your love

Oh, I need your love
I need you tonight
Can't do without
Oh, I need your love

Oh, I need your love
So I can hug
And squeeze you tight
Oh, I need your love

Baby
Come on home to me

I need your love

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact
I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?

I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact
That's where I'm at
Baby

I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
Now I know what
I've been missing
I need your loving
I need your love
I need your kissing, baby
