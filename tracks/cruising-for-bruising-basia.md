Cry
Come to me and cry
I know, I know, I know it's not easy
Your heart is aching
But so is mine,
But so is mine...

How
Can I tell you why
For so long, so long, so long
I've been thinking 
Now I know
I can't live a lie,
Can't live a lie...

They say true love lasts forever
If we want it
There will be waiting 
A second chance
Baby but now we need time,
Time to learn,
Time to understand
Where we went wrong 
'Cause I feel so strong
We're cruising for bruising, my baby
Second chance
Baby but now we need time,
Time to learn,
Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong
We're cruising for bruising...

Go
I must let you go
Don't stop, don't stop
'Cause it's better now,
When I still love you
Don't say goodbye,
Don't say goodbye...

They say true love lasts forever
If we want it, 
There will be waiting 
A second chance
Baby but now we need time, 
Time to learn,
Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong
We're cruising for bruising my baby,
Second chance
Baby but now we need time, 
Time to learn,
Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong
We're cruising for bruising...

...for so long, so long, so long...

So bye for now,
Don't let it die
'Cause we can try
Some other time

So bye for now
Don't let it die
'Cause we can try
Some other time
