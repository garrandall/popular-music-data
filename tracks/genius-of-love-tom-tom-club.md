My blood cells are little boats for tiny demons
Water rafting up my blood streaming
For that reason, I will never pass a drug screening
Screaming, nose bleeding every time I'm done dreaming
Young and uneven, lungs full of what the sun breathing
I guess that's why they gravitating to me
Imagination loopy as fallopian tubey
Fuck her, pull out then fill her throat with a smoothie and call it breakfast
Running round headless with these 100 pound peasants
Gunning down flexers with these underground treasures
Fuck it, Underwater breathing harder than I did above it
Though I love it, make her swallow kid just to keep from coughing
An evil genius so this pleases me
So high, ion need TV, just leave me be
With a bag of shrooms and a leaky freak
Licking molly off her EBT

Microscopic dinosaurs boil in the mud
I'm like full in the club, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever me
And everything's a crack rock and everything's a padlock
Everything is watching so everything's a snapshot
But you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me


Keep these bitches guessing, that's my greatest weapon
And I done ate already cause it's like 8: 11
And she like that's right, right there, right there, that's my favorite section
Girl when my sins get heavy, see you my favorite heaven
And I been up like all night and day
A pillow fort to hide your gorgeous face
Why cop the Porsche if not for open space?
Lawyer look like Cassius Clay
Sometimes feel like Tom Hanks off Castaway
And girl, I say that just to say that I been eyeing on you
Yea, yea, yea, you
Get the same jaded stares from the coupe but a hoop
Ain't with the who's-who's or playing with the lose-lose
I'm just a fucking hoot interested in knocking the boots
And turn a little miss piggy every which way but loose
Your best friend looking at us like which one of them gon shoot?
Thought that was your baby boo but she done gave up the loot so quickly
We'll be here for years on why he picked me

Microscopic dinosaurs boil in the mud
I'm like full in the club, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever me
And everything's a crack rock and everything's a padlock
Everything is watching so everything's a snapshot
But you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me, you don't ever see me
