I think I'm goin' to Katmandu,
That's really really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

Kkkkkk, Katmandu
I think it's really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin to Katmandu

I got no kick against the west coast,
Warner Brothers are such good hosts
I raise my whiskey glass, and give 'em a toast,
I'm sure they know it's true

I got no rap against the southern states
Every time I've been there it's been great
But now I'm leavin' and I can't be late
And to myself be true

That's where I'm goin to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

I got no quarrel with the midwest
The folks out there have given me their best
I lived there all my life I've been their guest
I sure have loved it too

I'm tired of lookin' at the tv news
I'm tired of drivin' hard and payin' dues
I figure baby I've got nothing to lose
I'm tired of being blue

That's why I'm goin to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

Kkkkkk, Katmandu
Take me baby cause I'm goin' with you
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin to Katmandu

I ain't got nothin' against the east coast
You want some people well they got the most
And New York City's like a friendly ghost
You seem to pass right through

I know I'm gonna miss the USA
I guess I'll miss it every single day
But no one loves me here anyway
I know my plane is due

The one that's goin to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

Kkkkkk, Katmandu
Really really really I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin to Katmandu

Oh oh oh, oh yeah

Katmandu
Katmandu
Katmandu
Katmandu
Katmandu
Katmandu
