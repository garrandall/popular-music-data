On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say, "Let there be light!"
So He could tell the day time from the night
And then he spoke again,
Felt the wind come rolling in
Smelled the rain
It soaked everything

And then the mountains rose up,
Across the Great Plains
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing,
"All it's missing is a pretty thing"

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, come on.

He made me back in '68,
The first time I met her I was nearly eight
And she was ten.
Her name was little KayLynn.
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father,
I was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter.
Thought I was in, he made me think again.

But when I turned 16, I thought it couldn't get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt.

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, ooh, come on.

Ooh, let there be cowgirls
Ooh, let there be cowgirls

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, ooh
Let there be cowgirls, come on.
