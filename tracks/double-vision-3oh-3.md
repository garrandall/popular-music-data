The sun is so hot
The drinks are so cold
Your clothes just fall off
As the day goes
We're gonna stay up
Ain't gonna lay low
We're gonna dance all night because we say so
(Na, na, na)


I'm thinkin' maybe, I can't have relationships
'Cause lately, they're not making any sense
And baby, you're the one thing on my mind
But that can change anytime


'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I've lost all feelin'
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seein' double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na, na


Let's do this outside
Shut down the whole block
Watch the girls strut by like it's a catwalk
We're livin' easy
We got the whole day
And we can go hard no matter what the cops say
(Na, na, na)


I'm thinking maybe, I can't have relationships
'Cause lately, they're not making any sense
And baby, you're the one thing on my mind but that can change anytime


'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I've lost all feelin'
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seein' double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na, na


I see no vitals on your E-K-G
Dead on the dance floor
We only
Clap because we need more
3OH!3 blowin' out your speakers
(Hey!)
Blowin' out your speakers


'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I've lost all feelin'
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na

'Cause there's so many fine women
That my head is spinnin'
And I'm seein' double vision
Everybody's singin' like
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na
(Hey!) Na, na, na (Hey, hey!) Na, na, na, na, na
