Knockout, yeah
Ray J
Bobby Brackins, yeah
Let's go!

143 I'll make you yell it when we sexin
143 is what you send me when we textin
I ball ba ba ball and pop pa pop bub
I'm just looking for some love in the club
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you

Ride with a stunna you know that I'm winning,
Headed to the top I ball no 9th inning,
Pop bottles in the club yes we can,
I don't even care if you a lesbian,
That just means we got some common interest,
Spark my trees then I'll spark your interest.
Okay... Let's pop some bubbly, tell me you in love with me,
No golf but club with me,
I'm big like double D's. Poppin in cities I aint heard of,
Let me see your titties, baby pull that shirt up,
Lift that skirt up got buns like a burger,
Do the most not the minimum you not a wage worker.

143 e e (aye what it do)
143 e e (aye what it do)
143 e e (aye what it do)
When you see me in the club say "I love you".

143 I'll make you yell it when we sexin
143 is what you send me when we textin
I ball ba ba ball and pop pa pop bub
I'm just looking for some love in the club
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you

Call up your local station if you hear this on the radio,
I'm calling up Ray J thinking about the video.
If we make a video I'ma need a scene,
With dimes in t-shirts that say 143!
I got my video all on TV (wa wa what's next Bob) we gone drop the E.P. Throwing dubs in the club, at the dance club,
Or at the strip club, it's 143 love.
Or settle at a playa location, made another hit for the radio station.
143 to the cutie from the club, stick shift love 143 so clutch.

143 e e (aye what it do)
143 e e (aye what it do)
143 e e (aye what it do)
When you see me in the club say "I love you".

143 I'll make you yell it when we sexin
143 is what you send me when we textin
I ball ba ba ball and pop pa pop bub
I'm just looking for some love in the club
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you

My girls a mack mack mack
Lambo's all black black black
In the club with stacks stacks stacks
143 stay it back back back
431 Sexy can I, fall in love
Sexy can I, run the club
143 ee girl I love you.

143 I'll make you yell it when we sexin
143 is what you send me when we textin
I ball ba ba ball and pop pa pop bub
I'm just looking for some love in the club
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
143 I la la la love you
