Whos that peeking in my window? uh
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info,
We can work it out no nintendo
I just hit ALT-TAB
Switchin in between two convos
I should just call, cabs
And bring them both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
Cause I remember Stacey, she prolly hate me,
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that sh*t I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to aim me
She stayed up late, she used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even photoshop couldn't change me
But you, you, you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even trying to settle so why try?
Ended the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched your love is so wi-fi

Girl girl girl girl girl girl
Shes Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl


My homies never see
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my louis computer bag
Wherever you are I could be
I type you messages for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Shes Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
(Ooh, she is my) My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl


Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind shawty
Your Donna Karan underwear, baby
I wanna see what's under there, baby


When you take the picture cut off your face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'm a hit home plate
Wait would this be considered our first date
Yay the pictures just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And playboy mags like Stacey Dash
And playboy mags like Stacy Dash
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls would make you wait longer than A. C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33 year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck
I hear the way the text say
Baby you up
Question mark
And she respond yes-s-s-I-r


Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
