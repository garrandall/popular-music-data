I know I'd go from rags to riches,
If you would only say you cared.
Although my pockets may be empty,
I'd be a millionaire.

My clothes may still be torn and tattered,
But in my heart I'd be a king.
Your love is all that ever mattered,
You're everything...

So open your heart,
And you'll open the door,
To all the treasure,
That I'm hopin' for.

Hold me, kiss me,
And say you'll be mine,
Evermore.

Must I forever be foresaken,
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you.

So open your heart,
And you'll open the door,
To all the treasure,
That I'm hopin' for.

Hold me, kiss me,
And say you'll be mine,
Evermore.

Must I forever be foresaken,
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you.
