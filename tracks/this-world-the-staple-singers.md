Lord, you've done everything you've said
Everything that you said you would do
You gave us food to eat, and I have things to do
But the world we're livin' in, such a mean old world
Misery and sadness is everywhere
And some times it seems so hard to bare
But stay with us, stay with us, don't leave us
(And I know we'll make it)
I said that (I know we'll make it)

Everything seems to be going wrong
But Lord you're gonna fix it yeah, before very long
Lord this is the time of war and hate
But all we're sayin' is you'll surely make a wave
(Stay with us)
Yeah, stay with us, don't leave us
(Don't leave us)
(I know we'll make it) Oh, yeah
(I know we'll make it)
(We're gonna make it)

As long as you are by my side (We're gonna make it)
As long as you will be my guy (We gonna make it)
Oh, my  is upward bound (We gonna make)
Baby ain't nobody gonna turn it around
Stay with us, don't leave us
(I know we'll make it)
I said that
(I know we'll make it)
Stay with us, don't leave us, don't leave us
(I know we'll make it)
You know I know we'll make it
(Stay with us)
We gonna make it
(Stay with us)
Through hard times
(Stay with us)
And tribulations
(Stay with us)
I keep on prayin'
(Stay with us)
Keep on trustin'
(Stay with us)
Every round
(Stay with us)
Just a little bit higher
(Stay with us)
Stand by my side darlin
(Stay with us)
Don't you leave me alone
(Stay with us)
In the midnight hour
(Stay with us)
In the midnight hour
(Stay with us)
In the midnight hour
(Stay with us)
Yeah, don't you leave me alone
(Stay with us)
