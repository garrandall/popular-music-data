If you want to get with me there's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low


B- B- B- B Bass down low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

Bass Bass Down Low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low

It's like 1, 2, 3 Fuck it
I'm about to take a
Drink and just stuff it

Fish tank this thing
With 4 more shots
Of patron I give a fuck
About going home

Straight Buzzing Robotussing
Wanna get your mits in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin
Get get get a lick of this lovin

Yeah I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

If you wanna get with me
There's somethings you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low


B- B- B- B Bass down low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low


Drop it to the floor
Bass Down Low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low

Uh, yeah
Ok this drag girl's killing my bisa
Because my rings have been living in a freezer
We all carry on by the litre
Gettin' lean like the tower of pisa
She say she fly from Miami to Ibiza
Nigga I'll be doing anything to please her
So when I say well simon lewwen Jay
Later I'll be getting in between her
And I like it loud and I make disturb London town
'Cause a money make a Black Eyed Pea
Every note in my wallet is a Â£50

If you want to get with me there's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

B- B- B- B Bass down low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low


Drop it to the floor
Bass Down Low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low

I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow

La la la la La la la la
La la la la La la la la
La la la la La la la la
La la la la La la la la

If you wanna get with me there's some things you gotta know
Drop it to the floor

Bass down low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my
Bass down low

Drop it to the floor
Bass down low
Bass Bass Bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
