Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
How many hearts must break how many it's gonna take
To satisfy you just to satisfy you.

Another love another fool to play your game
Another love another fool they're all the same
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do.

You're gonna find when it's too late
Heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you
Just to satisfy you.

How many hearts must break
How many will it take
To satisfy you
Just to satisfy you.

Just to satisfy you
Satisfy you
Just to satisfy you.

Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
You're gonna find when it's too late
Heart that just won't break.

Just to satisfy you.
Just to satisfy you.
Just to satisfy you.
Satisfy you.
Just to satisfy you...
