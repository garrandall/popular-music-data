Oh oh yeah yeah
Yuh too cold, too cold

Yuh gimme love all night, Love all day
Weh yuh find time fi go stray?
Yuh left from fi him yard come ah my yard
Gyal yuh too wicked oh my god
When yuh feel mi ah sleep yuh ah text him
Even fox nuh sly like you 
It's like yesterday yuh send I do today yuh tun in ah ice cube

Yuh too cold, mi feel the freeze in ah mi soul
Whenever you touch me, touch me
It's like me ah fall true slow whenever we make love, make love

Ice Queen (You deserve it)
Ice Queen (shouldn't love yuh)
Ice Queen (Yuh frozen, frozen)


See You all night,see you all day, never know seh ah suh you stay
When mi leave out yuh fuck her, then mi reach home before yuh tun work
Me and you deh ah show you ah text ar even bulb nuh bright like you
Memba yuh say him nuh wan mi so yuh nuh fi boda watch what I do

Yuh too cold, mi feel the freeze in ah mi soul
Whenever you touch me, touch me
It's like me ah fall true slow whenever we make love, make love

Ice Queen (You deserve it)
Ice Queen (shouldn't love yuh)
Ice Queen (Yuh frozen, frozen)


(melody)

Love all night, Love all day, Love all day,
Love all night love all day, weh yuh find time fi stray?

Yuh too cold, mi feel the freeze in ah mi soul
Whenever you touch me, touch me
It's like me ah fall true slow whenever we make love, make love

Ice Queen (You deserve it)
Ice Queen (shouldn't love yuh)
Ice Queen (Yuh frozen, frozen)
