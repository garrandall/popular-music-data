I'm gonna love you, my baby
Gonna do it your way
I wanna show you, my darling
And then I'm gonna change my way
I got to have you back
To spend my every day
So believe me

All I wanna do is stay true to you, girl
Don't let me go
'Cause I never meant to stray
Never thought that I could hurt you girl
All I wanna do is stay
True to you
Sometimes you know, we can all make mistakes
Wanna let you know I need you girl
All I wanna do is stay

May I ask you
If I could hold you in my arms
The way we used to
When we were shooting for the stars
If I could only have
Just one more little chance
For our romance

All I wanna do is stay true to you
Don't let me go
'Cause I never meant to stray
Never thought that I could hurt you girl
All I wanna do is stay
True to you
Sometimes you know, we can all make mistakes
Wanna let you know I need you girl
All I wanna do is stay

Oh I hope and I pray
That I'm still in your heart
(Oh baby girl)
And if it's not too late, girl
Then I'm ready to start

All I wanna do is stay true to you, girl
Don't let me go
I never meant to stray
Never thought that I could hurt you girl
All I wanna do is stay
True to you girl
Sometimes you know, we can all make mistakes
Wanna let you know I need you girl
All I wanna do is stay

True to your love
(True to your love)
True to you girl
(True to you girl)
True to your love
True to you girl
True to your love
(True to your love)
True to you girl
(True to you girl
True to your love
(Wanna be true)
True to you girl

Oh I hope and I pray
That I'm still in your heart
(Woah baby girl)
And if it's not too late, girl
Then I'm ready to start

All I wanna do is stay true to you, girl
Don't let me go
I never meant to stray
Never thought that I could hurt you girl
All I wanna do is stay
True to you girl
Sometimes you know, we can all make mistakes
Wanna let you know I need you girl
All I wanna do is stay

True to your love
True to you girl
True to your love
True to you girl
(All I wanna do is stay)
True to your love
True to you girl
True to your love
True to you girl

Stay, stay - stay, stay
Stay, stay - stay, stay
Stay, stay - stay, stay
Woah
Stay, stay - stay, stay
I wanna be true to your love
Stay, stay - stay, stay
Stay, stay - stay, stay
Woah
Stay
