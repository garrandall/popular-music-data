Come on, feet, start moving
Got to get me there
Ow!
Hey, hey!
Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh, oh!
Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Oh!

Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurting mighty bad
Now I've been walking for three days and two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad, huh

But I got a woman waiting for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see she's got the kind of loving and a kissing
A-make a man go stone wild

So I got to keep on walking, mm-hm, huh
I got to walk on, oh, ho, ho
(I-I, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby calling my name
It's as if as though I'm standing at her front door
I can hear her, that's doggone plain

Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time, huh
Now when I kiss her lips, I turn a back over flip
And I forget these feet of mine

I got to keep on walking, hey, oh
I got to walk on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all
(I-I, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired, huh
But I just can't lose my stride

Whoa, come on, feet, don't fail me now (come on, feet, don't stop)
I got ten more miles to go (ten more miles)
I got nine (same old, same old)
Eight (same old, same old)
Seven (same old, same old)
Six, six, six (same old, same old)

I got a five more miles to go
Over the hill, just around the bend, huh
Although my feet are tired, I can't lose my stride
I got to get to my baby again

I got to keep on walking, mm-hm, hey
I got to walk on, please let me ya, y'all
(I-I, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired, huh
But I just can't lose my stride

(Walking) Yeah, huh
I got to walk on, let me ya, y'all
(I-I, I-I, I, I, I) You see, my baby just across the bend
(I-I, I-I, keep on, keep on) Whoa

(Walking) Hey, hey now
I got to walk on, let me ya, y'all, got to be
(I-I, I-I, I, I, I)
