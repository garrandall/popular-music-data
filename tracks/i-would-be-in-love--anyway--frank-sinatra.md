If I lived the past over, saw today from yesterday
I would be in love anyway
If I knew that you'd leave me, if I knew you wouldn't stay
I would be in love anyway
Sometimes I think, think about before
Sometime I think, if I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow
Though you'll never be with me, and there are no words to say
I'll still be in love anyway
If I knew then what I know now, I don't believe I'd ever change
Somehow if I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow
