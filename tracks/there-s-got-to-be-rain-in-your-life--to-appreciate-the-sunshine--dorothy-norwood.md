You know it's said that into each life, some rain must fall
But behind every dark cloud, the sun will shine
I want to take a little time out to explain to you what I mean
You see, you don't know how good it is to get over, If you've never been under
You don't know how it feels to be up, If you've never been down
You don't know how good it is to have peace of mind, If you've never had to worry
You see you just don't realize what it is to be happy, If you've never been sad
Let me tell you why

It's got to be rain in your life
To appreciate the sunshine
It's got to be rain in your life
To appreciate the sunshine

When trouble comes, That's rain
When you're sad, Rain
When the tears are falling down, That's rain
When death come calling, It ain't nothing but rain
You don't know what it is to wear a smile
(If you've never wore a frown)
You don't know what it is to be free, ya'll
(If you've never been bound)
