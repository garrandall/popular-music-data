I was captivated
And I waited for you, babe
Every lonely night
So fascinated
Hesitated just a bit too long
You got me wonderin, if

I'll be missing you
Will he be kissing you
I guess were gonna have to wait and see
Wholl be the fool tonight
Cmon baby
Wholl be the fool tonight
Cmon baby

Now sweet sensation
All around you
Oh, you better look before you leap
Gonna keep on tryin, babe
I want you close to me
Then we would be just like those lovers that I see
Now ya got me wonderin, if

I'll be missing you
Now baby, will he be kissing you
Wo--ah baby, I guess were gonna have to wait and see
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna wait
Cmon baby
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna wait
Cmon baby
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna have to wait and see

Oh baby...

I'll be missing you
Will he be kissing you
I guess were gonna have to wait and see
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna wait
Cmon baby
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna wait
Cmon baby
Wholl be the fool tonight
I guess were gonna have to wait and see

Oh baby...

I guess were gonna wait
I guess were gonna wait
I guess were gonna have to wait and see
