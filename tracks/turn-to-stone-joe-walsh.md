Hey now, the wells run dry
Pages of your book on fire
Read the writing on the wall

Hoedown, it's a showdown
Everywhere you look, we're fighting
Hear the call

And you know it's gettin' stronger
I don't think they can last much longer
Turn to stone

Well, there's a change in the wind
You know the signs don't lie
Such a strange feelin' and I don't know why
It's takin' such a long time

And the backyard people and they work all day
The day gets wasted, it's safe to say
The day's spent makin' words rhyme

And you know it's getting stronger
I can't make'em rhyme that much longer
Turn to stone
