I surrender
I give my love to you
I surrender
You say you love me too

You gave your heart (your heart)
And your soul (your soul)
You said your love for me
Will never grow old

Well, I'm reeling
Yes, I'm reeling
And I surrender
My heart's reeling
And I surrender

I want your love as much
As you want mine
So keep on loving me, yeah

Cause I surrender
Want you to be my guy
Cause your love makes
My magic sigh

You gave your heart (your heart)
And your soul (your soul)
You said your love for me
Will never grow old

Well, I'm reeling
Yes, I'm reeling
And I surrender
My heart's reeling
And I surrender

I want your love as much
As you want mine
So keep on loving me, yeah

Cause I surrender
Welcome to my love
Welcome, baby
Let's make it hand and glove

Don't ever leave me
Just try and please me
So keep on loving me, yeah

Well, I surrender
I give my love to you
I surrender
You said you love me too

You gave your heart (your heart)
And your soul (your soul)
You said your love for me
Will never grow old

Well, I'm reeling
Yes, I'm reeling
And I surrender
My heart's reeling

Makes me yours
(Makes me yours)
Makes me yours
(I'll be yours)
So keep on loving me, yeah

Take my lips (I surrender)
Take my arms (I surrender)
Take my heart (I surrender)
Take my soul (I surrender)

Cause I surrender
(Take my love)
