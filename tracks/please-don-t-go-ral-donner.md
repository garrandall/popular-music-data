You're gonna make
You're gonna make me cry
I know you'd love to see me cry But I still love you so
Why, I'll never know
But please don't go If you don't want
If you don't want me to cry
Well, baby look
I'm starting to cry But I still love you so
Why, I'll never know
But please don't go Now, other loves
Have come into my life
But you're the one
That puts me in paradise Well, come on, come on
Come on and make me cry
You know, you know
That you can make me cry And I still love you so
Why, I'll never know
But please don't go And I still love you so
Why, I'll never know
But please don't go
