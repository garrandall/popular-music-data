Chickens pasta cheese that's fettuccine (that's fettuccine)
I smoke stinky pack that's why I'm so stinky (I'm so stinky)
I told her ride it
Bendz or Bema Lamborghini
Make that dick disappear Mrs. Houdini
Told her that back
Bring that ass back like a rental
She gon let me beat I ain't talkin instrumental
Do work in her mouth have work no I ain't talkin dental
But I let the bitch trip cause I find that a bit coincidental
Oohoof You hear the oohoof that's just me powering up
Oohoof You hear the oohoof that means you fucked up
Dodi stick got her lost like she a new student
Hit her with the dick she though she was struck by cupid
I take his hoe I'm sorry not sorry
That hoe is in love with the charlie like charlie
We smoke just like Marley she ride just like Harley
She wanna record for the web like ICarley
My niggas insane so stay in your lane
That bitch like madden but don't play no games
Believe me when I say that bitch gon blow
Man her head game on Saddam Hussein
I pull up like bow pull up go bow
I take his how then I take a bow
He talking shit his bitch wanna pic
Throwin this money I ain't throwin a fit
Wanna get to know a nigga now they see him on top
Told em take time like use my watch
I fucked his hoe no Gucci flip flops
But I did bust it down all in my crocs

I might fuck that hoe
I might fuck her friend
She gon let me fuck
Nigga once again
2 bad broads in that flash ten
Oh they gon let me fuck oh yeah oh yeah once again

Ok wait a minuet you know who it be
Mr. Healthy long sleep denim ripped up Tommy jeans
Might have seen me on the screen
Grindin in them street
Boolin with my Dodi team
Posted all in 23's
Pussy boy a jelly bean

Pockets fat that Philly cheese
Heavy snowflakes in my tree
Roll my blunts and sprinkle Kief
Takin off to Saturn's ring
Oh you do not know of me?
Gon and search me up on Bing
Wolf gang grip in my Impala
Texas nigga so she know that I'm a baller
Pager beepin with lil chica wanna holler
If you ain't gon give me face don't even bother
50's bumoin my trunk locked up Donkey Kong
Wipe me down shine me up that Armor all
See my wallet on  I'm a boss
BLAKE and Sun that's who they choose overall

I might fuck that hoe
I might fuck her friend
She gon' let me fuck
Nigga once again
2 bad broads in that flash ten
Oh they gon' let me fuck oh yeah oh yeah once again
