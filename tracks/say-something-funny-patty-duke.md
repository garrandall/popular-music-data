Everyone is watching us
We're the perfect couple, they say
While the crowd is watching us
Please don't give our secret away

(CHORUS)
Say something funny to me
Make me laugh so they won't see
How much it hurts
Loving you the way I do
And knowing I'm losing you

Look at how they envy us
They don't know were saying goodbye
Please don't let them pity me
Don't let them see me
Break down and cry

(CHORUS)

Why did you fall out of love with me
And turn my whole world blue
What's she got that I haven't got
She's got you

(CHORUS)

Say something funny to me
(Everyone is watching)
Make me laugh so they won't see
(Everyone is watching)

Say something funny to me
(Everyone is watching)
Make me laugh so they won't see
(Everyone is watching)
