A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter sky 
As the world and I go screaming into the phantom night 
It doesn't matter where it leads, I got nowhere left to go 
If there's any chance at all, it's somewhere down this road 

To be wild again, no one's child again 
Yeah I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again 
Oh to be wild again 

The fading light is cold on the shoulders of the trees 
Oh the star wind blows right through me, and I never felt so free 
Oh there had to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line 
And it came down to the question, is this life I'm livin' mine 

Had to be wild again, no one's child again 
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin 
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win 
I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again (Fire again) 
I want to be wild again (Wild again) 

There has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line 
And it comes down to the question, what is theirs and what is mine 

Wild again, no one's child again 
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin 
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win 
I want to see those eyes in the mirror, burn with life again (Life again) 
Yeah 
I want to be wild (Wild again), let the change begin 
I want to find the edge, risk it all, want to burn with life again 
want to be wild again, yeah, I want to be wild again 
Wild again
