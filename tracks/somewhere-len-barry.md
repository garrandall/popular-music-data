There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us
Someday, a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and
We're half way there
Hold my hand and
I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere

Yes, there's a place for us
For in this world
There's a place for all lovers
And it's a warm, kind, wonderful place
Always to be beside each other

Somehow, someday, somewhere

Hold my hand and
We're half way there
Hold my hand and
I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere

I know, I know, I know
I know that there's a place for us
A wonderful place for us somewhere

I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure...
