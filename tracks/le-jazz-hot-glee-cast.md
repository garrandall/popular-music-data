'Bout twenty years ago
Way down in New Orleans
A group of fellers found
A new kind of music
And they decided to call it...JAZZ
No other sound has
What this music has

Before they knew it
It was whizzing round the world
The world was ready
For a blue kind of music
And now they play it
From Steamboat Springs to La Paz

Oh baby, won't you play me
Le Jazz Hot maybe
And don't ever let it end
I tell you, friend
It's really something to hear
I can't sit still
When there's that rhythm near me

Oh, so baby
Le Jazz Hot may be
What's holding my soul together
Don't know whether it's morning or night
Only know it's sounding right
So come on in and play me Le Jazz Hot
Baby, cause I love my jazz... Hot

Before they knew it
It was whizzing round the world
The world was ready
For a blue kind of music
And now they play it
From Steamboat Springs to La Paz

When you play me
Le Jazz Hot baby
You're holding my soul together
Don't know whether it's morning or night
Only know it's sounding right
So come on in and play me
Le Jazz Hot baby
Cause I love... my jazz hot
Le Jazz Hot

Le Jazz Hot
