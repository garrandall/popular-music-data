I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright


Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright


Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-oh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good


And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good
