Up in the morning, it's six o'clock
Head for the city
Turn on the music, the radio
Nobody's boogie (Nobody's boogie)

Day after day, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Slavin' away, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Punch in the timer, I'm late again
Sneak in the back way
I count the hours, minutes too
So glad it's Friday (So glad it's Friday)

Jump in my ride, ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's Friday night, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Only on a Friday
Never on a Sunday
Never on a Monday

Same situation every day
Some kind of voodoo (Some kind of voodoo)
Same complications stand in the way
Nowhere to run to (Nowhere to run to)

My mind is dreaming I'm somewhere else
Can't seem to shake it (Can't seem to shake it)
I miss the feeling, having fun
No way to fake it (No way to fake it)

Jump in my ride, ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's Friday night, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
