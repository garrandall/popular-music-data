When wilt thou save the people?
Oh God of mercy, when?
Not kings and lords, but nations
Not thrones and crowns, but men
Flowers of thy heart
Oh God are they
Let them not pass like weeds away
Their heritage, a sunless day

God save the people

Shall crime bring crime forever
Strength aiding still as strong?
Is it thy will, oh Father
That men shall toil
For wrong?
No, say thy mountains
No, say thy skies
Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise
And songs be heard instead of sighs

God save the people

When wilt thou save the people?
Oh God of mercy, when?
Not kings and lords, but nations
Not thrones and crowns, but men
God save the people
For thine they are
Thy children as thy angels fair
Save the people from despair

God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people

When will God save the people?
Oh God of mercy, when?
The people, Lord, the people
Not thrones and crowns, but men
God save the people
For thine they are
Thy children as thy angels fair
Save the people from despair

God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people
God save the people
Oh God save the people
