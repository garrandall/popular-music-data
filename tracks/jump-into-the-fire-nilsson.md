One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

"No" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, that you'll ever know

You can climb a mountain, you can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire but you'll never be free
You can shake me up, or I can break you down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

You can climb a mountain, you can swim the sea
You can climb a mountain but you'll never be free
Or you can shake me up, or you can break me down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

Oh!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
