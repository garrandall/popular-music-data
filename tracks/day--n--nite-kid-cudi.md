Day n nite.
I toss and turn, I keep stressin my mind, mind.
I look for peace, but see I don't attain.
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Play play play play play play play

Now look at this.
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me.
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast.
I think the first but surely finish last, last.
Last last last last last last last last

Cause day n nite (day n nite)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
Hes all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.
Day n nite. (day n nite)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
Hes all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite

Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite 

Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite 

Hold the phone.
The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low.
Hes on the move, can't seem to shake the shake.
Within his dreams he sees the life he made.
Made

The pain is deep.
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep.
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
It seems the feelings that she had are through.
Through through through through through through through

Cause day n nite (day n nite)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
Hes all alone through the day n nite (day n nite)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.
Day n nite (day n nite)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
Hes all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite
Ah ah at nite

Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite 

Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite 

Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite
Ah ah ah ah ah ah at nite
