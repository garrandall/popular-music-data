I'm so blind, oh I just can't see, what kind of love you expect from me
Let me know, you gotta sort this out
Come on babe, I've had enough of this doubt
I thought I knew what you wanted, just goes to show I was wrong
I'm twice the man that ya, you think I am, this time I'm gonna be strong, yeah

Chorus:
Shake it up - oh yeah, put the world to right
Shake it up - this gotta be, babe, that's alright
Shake it up - yeah baby, you ran out of luck
Shake it up - yeah yeah yeah
Whoo, you don't know, oh what you've done for me
You built me up, baby, can't you see
Don't seem right that after all this time

I found out you're no friend of mine
You knew that sooner or later, you knew it deep in your heart
All the troubles that ya, you gave to me, babe
Were gonna tear us, tear us apart

Shake it up - oh yeah, put the world to right
Shake it up - this gotta be, babe, that's alright
Shake it up - yeah baby, you ran out of luck
Shake it up - yeah yeah yeah
Whoo, you don't know, oh what you've done for me
You built me up, baby, can't you see
Don't seem right that after all this time
You had me searchin' for answers, you had me livin' from day to day
I guess you ran out of chances, whoo babe, there was no other way

I thought I knew what you wanted, just goes to show I was wrong
I'm twice the man that ya, you think I am, this time I'm gonna be strong, yeah

Shake it up - oh yeah, put the world to right
Shake it up - this gotta be, babe, that's alright
Shake it up - yeah baby, you ran out of luck
Shake it up - yeah yeah yeah
Whoo, you don't know, oh what you've done for me
You built me up, baby, can't you see
Don't seem right that after all this time
