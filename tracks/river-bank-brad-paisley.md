Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a bag of ice

You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ainât like we really need a million dollar yacht, 'cause


We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
Weâre near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
Weâre laughing all the way to the river bank

Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
Iâd go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And weâd tell our bosses they can do the same
Weâll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

Weâd sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why donât you grab your bikini 'cause



However it goes (whatever happens),
Weâve got it made (in these shades)
'Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away


We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
Weâre near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day.
Weâre laughing all the way
To the river bank
