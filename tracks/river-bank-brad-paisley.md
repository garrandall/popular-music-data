Well, I won two dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought two more with it
And I won ten bucks and that was just right
So I bought a six-pack and a bag of ice

Ya know even if our ship came in
And this is all we got
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht...'
Cause

We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way
To the river bank

Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I'd go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we'd tell our bosses they can do the same
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But 'til that dream comes true, why don't ya grab your bikini...
'Cause

We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way
To the river bank

However it goes (whatever happens)
We've got it made (in these shades)
'Cause, baby, we can float (behind this boat)
And we can ride a wave

We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich

But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day, we're laughing all the way
To the river bank
