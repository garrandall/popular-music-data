Pack up your bags, put on your dress
Caught a ride on the Pony Express
Sweep the sawdust off of the floor
Spin your spurs 'til they fly outdoors

Saddle up, buttercup
For the Pony Express
Yes, the Pony Express

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy hi ho Silver
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy hi ho Silver
Oh, oh, oh

Tonto, Silver and my old Paint
We ain't missing the Pony Express

See the pretty little ponytails
When they're swishing every male wails, wails
Six chicks that look so fine
With a pony in a chorus line

So cute, lost my boots
On the Pony Express
Yes, the Pony Express

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy hi ho Silver
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy hi ho Silver
Oh, oh, oh

Tonto, Silver and my old paint
We ain't missing the Pony Express

Philadelphia to Boston, Mass
Salt Lake City to old El Pas
Pasadena to Portland, Maine
Albuquerque and back again

Pony Express will rock on through
I'll be there, will you be too?

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy hi ho Silver
Oh, oh, oh

Tonto, Silver and my old paint
We ain't missing the Pony Express

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy

Tonto, Silver and my old paint
We ain't missing the Pony Express

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy
