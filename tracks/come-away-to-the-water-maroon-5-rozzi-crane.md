Come away little lass
Come away to the water
To the ones that are waiting only for you
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
Away from the life that you always knew
We are calling to you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
In the shade of the night weâll come looking for you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
To the ones appointed to see it through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you 

Come away little lamb 
Come away to the water
Give yourself so we might live anew 
Come away little lamb
Come away to the slaughter 
To the ones appointed to see this through 
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

Come away little lamb 
Come away to the water
To the arms that are waiting only for you
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter
To the one appointed to see this through 
We are calling for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you
