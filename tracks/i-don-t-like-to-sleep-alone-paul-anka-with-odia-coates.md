I don't like to sleep alone
Stay with me
Don't go
Talk with me for just a while (in this line I don? hear "for")

So much of you to get to know
Reaching out touching you
Leaving all the worries behind
Loving you the way I do

My mouth on yours and yours on mine
Marry me
Let me live with you
Nothing's wrong and love is right

Like a man says in his song
Help me make it through the night
Loneliness can get you down
When you get to thinking no one cares

Lean on me
And I'll lean on you
Together we will see it through

No, I don't like to sleep alone
It's sad to think some folks do
No I don't like to sleep alone
No one does

Do you?

In the last verse you write:
No, I don't like to sleep alone
It's sad to think some folks do
No I don't like to sleep alone
No one does
Do you?
But they sing only:
I don? like to sleep alone
No one does
Do you?
