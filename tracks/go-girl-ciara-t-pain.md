This is nappy boy radio, live back with ya boy T-Pain
You already know what it is man
I got something special for the ladies out here
All those Go-Girls out there, I got some brand new, CiCi
Featuring...ME (Haha)
You already know this man, hit us up on the hotline
I'm a play this 14 times,
Just hit us up when you wanna hear it again
Nappy boy!


I, I, I, I I'm the incredible, super-sexual
Call me 'Cici', let's go and I know that you see me
Can't be just like, can't make that happen
'Cause I am the original and you ain't got that swagga
I'm the sha-sha-sha-sha-sha and yo' lady wanna be me
That's a fact, know that, yes indeedy (Get 'em CiCi!)
Sit back, relax, enjoy the show
Yeah I can hang and I think that's why they call me...

Go-Girl
'Cause I be going on 'em,
Oh they couldn't stop if they wanted to
That's why they call me
Go-Girl
I'm the energized PlayBoy bunny, I keep going and going
And you know it, that's why they call me
Go-Girl
Please let me know, if you really want mo'
I can take it to the flo'
Sit back, relax, enjoy the show,
Call me baby I can be your Go-Girl

I'll be your med for, for the high dro, make ya sleepy
Nasty girl, keep it on the low, its a secret
I'm moving up, down, round and round, do a little trick,
Then I swirled around, you be like
"Yeah man" and "That one is so bad, and I really want to meet her!"
Sit back, relax, enjoy the show
Yeah I can hang and I think that's why they call me...

Go-Girl
'Cause I be going on 'em,
Oh they couldn't stop if they wanted to
That's why they call me
Go-Girl
I'm the energized PlayBoy bunny, I keep going and going
And you know it, that's why they call me
Go-Girl
Please let me know, if you really want mo'
I can take it to the flo'
Sit back, relax, enjoy the show,
Call me baby I can be your Go-Girl


Even with a IQ of 42, they say I'm a motha, motha genuis
Teddy Pain on that thing, there is no need for a remix
It's CiCi, T.P. we be T-H-E B-E-S-T
I, R-I-P every M.C. on late thats OMG,
I stop that beat so I can speak one more word of unique lines
If he say he can beat me then obviously he lied
Keep tryin', this one for the Go-Girls that won't stop
Them other hoes just ain't that hot,
I got yo' back like a tanky-top
Now go, go girl


Go-Girl
'Cause I be going on 'em,
Oh they couldn't stop if they wanted to
That's why they call me
Go-Girl
I'm the energized PlayBoy bunny, I keep going and going
And you know it, that's why they call me
Go-Girl
Please let me know, if you really want mo'
I can take it to the flo'
Sit back, relax, enjoy the show,
Call me baby I can be your Go-Girl

If you make the track stop when you pop, yous a Go-Girl
Uh huh huh, then yous a Go-Girl
If you a work hard for your money yous a Go-Girl
Uh huh huh, you betta go girl
Gotta a couple, breakin on the side, yous a Go-Girl

Blow his mind, and you keep it hood,
Like a real live woman should
Shawty yous a Go-Girl

Go-Girl

Oh they couldn't stop if they wanted to
That's why they call me
Go-Girl
