Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more


Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you


Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice


Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you


There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah


Look into your heart, babe
Yeah
Oh Yeah


Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you


You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh, I do it for you

Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
We will see it through
Oh yeah
Yeah!

Search your heart, search your soul
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
Oh yeah

I'll be there, yeah, oh
I'll walk the wire for you, yeah
I will die for you

Oh yeah
All the time
I'm going all the way, all they way, yeah

Take me by the hand
Ow!
