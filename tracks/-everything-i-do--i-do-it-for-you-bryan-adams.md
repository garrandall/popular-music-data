Look in to my eyes
You will see what you mean to me
Search your heart,
search your soul
Oh, when you find me
there you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true,
everything I do, I do it for you
Look in to your heart, you will find
There is nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not
worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's
nothin' I want more
You know it's true,
everything I do, I do it for you
There is no love, like your love
An' no other could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless your there
All the time, all the way
Everything I do
You can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I just can't help it,
there's nothin' in the
world I want more
Oh, I would fight for
you, yeah, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you,
yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true,
everything I do, I do it for you
