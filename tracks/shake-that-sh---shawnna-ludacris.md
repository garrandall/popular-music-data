Man, these women is awfully nasty
An' these women keep walkin' past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your booty in the way and shake that shit

These players is 'bout they bank
An' these players keep buyin' drinks
Lips crisp, from my body on your lips
Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit

S H A to the W double N A
Real bitch don't play
Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say
You're actin' like the Dukes of the Fifth won't spray

It's okay, they gon' learn
Chi's most wanted bitch wait your turn
Sac full of yum, I'm a make that burn
Y'all can't smoke none anyway

Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
Trying to figure out
If they're scared of the hips or the chips
Or they really can't talk to a bitch wit wild guns

No games, hat to the side wit low frame
Now I came in this industry killin' 'em
Now they all feelin' me
Sippin' on Henny wit an O and a gram

Man, these women is awfully nasty
An' these women keep walkin' past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your booty in the way and shake that shit

These players is 'bout they bank
An' these players keep buyin' drinks
Lips crisp, from my body on your lips
Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit

C H I to the C A G O
If you ain't been, don't go
My city's so fast, you react so slow
Your heart might stop and your blood won't flow

That ain't right, I stomp through the hood
Wit a grand on my feet like that ain't tight
Diamonds on my neck like that ain't bright
I come through and shut down the Saturday Night

Hell yeah, you can kiss that an'
Feel there, bring it right back
Don't mess wit the frame if you don't know a thing
Six years in the game, I'm still here

Hold up, they mad cause the streets is sold up
I'm back on my feet, so watch for the cops
We'll never stop
Just rep for ya block and throw it up

Man, these women is awfully nasty
An' these women keep walkin' past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your booty in the way and shake that shit

These players is 'bout they bank
An' these players keep buyin' drinks
Lips crisp, from my body on your lips
Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit

M I D to the W E S T
Better yet that's me
Most of y'all chicks gotta impress me
You say you got skills, put 'em up let's see

Show and prove, I hate to really see
What y'all goin' through, put on any beat
We could spit it in the street
From the West to the East, or South to the house
Just showin' love

Go home, the body on the flo' is so grown
What cha gon' do when you call to ya label?
An' ya gotta shed a tear, 'cause you hear
Ya career's been postponed

Back up, smart mouth bitches
Get slapped up, take it to the trap
Get clapped up, put it in ya brain
That the female game been wrapped up

Man, these women is awfully nasty
An' these women keep walkin' past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your booty in the way and shake that shit

These players is 'bout they bank
An' these players keep buyin' drinks
Lips crisp, from my body on your lips
Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit

Man, these women is awfully nasty
An' these women keep walkin' past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your booty in the way and shake that shit

These players is 'bout they bank
An' these players keep buyin' drinks
Lips crisp, from my body on your lips
Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit

Shorty said, shorty said
Shorty said, shorty said
Wait a minute, hold up
Wait a minute, hold up

Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, now wait a minute
Shorty said, shorty said
Shorty said, shorty said
