When you see a gentleman bee
Round a lady bee buzzin'
Just count to ten then count again
There's sure to be an even dozen

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
They play the same

Now, there was two butterflies castin' their eyes
Both in the same direction
You'd never guess that one little yes
Could start a butterfly collection

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
They play the same

Let me tell ya now …I say one and one is five
You can call me a silly goat
But, ya take two minks add two winks
Ah ... ya got one mink coat

When a girl gets coy in front of a boy
After three or four dances
Ah … you can just bet she'll play hard to get
To multiply her chances

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
You know they play the same

Hear me talkin' to ya …Mother Nature's a clever girl
She relies on habit
Ya take two hares with no cares
Pretty soon you got a room full of rabbits

Parakeets in-between tweets
Sometimes get too quiet
Uh-oh … but, have no fear 'cause soon you'll hear
A parakeet's riot just try it

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And every generation
You know they play the same

Yes ... it's multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
They play the same

They'd better...
