Why do you play this sly game
Why do you freak-I know you're weak for me
I only got an hour baby
I hate to go-But this is life on the road
You knew it when you met me
You said it was no problem
You said that you could deal now you feel
Just like a part-time lover
And though I have no other
Hey girl-I got your number


Call me, If you need some love and affection
Call me, Just look in my direction
Call me, For a little understanding child
Call me, Hey girl-I got your number

Why do you play this shy game
Why do you square-I know you care for me
100 miles per hour baby
I hate to go-But this is life on the road
You knew it when you met me
You said it was no problem
You said that you could deal now you feel
Just like a part-time lover
And though I have no other
Hey girl-I got your number-ugh

Call me, If you need some satisfaction
Call me, Just look in my direction
Call me, If you need some understanding child
I know your every move baby
I know you inside out
I know what makes you tick child
I know you like the back of my hand
I know the things you like to do
I know you need a love that's true
I'll give you everything and more
That's what I'm living for
Baby girl you know the score

Call me-


Yeah, I got your number
I know you like the back of my hand
Hey girl-I got your number
I know what makes you tick child
Yes I know you
Call me-(ad lib)

If you want to ugh
Hey girl-I got your number
Call me, If you want to dance all night
If you want a love that's right
Hey girl-I got your number

I know you like the back-back of my hand
I know you like the favorite book on my nightstand
I know you like the way that you talk to the chicks
When I turn my head and they call you slick
I know you like the song that stays in my heart
I know you like drama and in time you'll see
That I rock real hard 'cause I am L.T.
Call me-Call me R.J.-I got your number
I know you like the way that I turn you round
When I hold you tight and I love you down
I know you like the most important ecstacy
That I ever heard and that could ever be
I know you like the streets that I grew up on
I know you like my rap and I know it's strong
I know you like I know you and I got to say
That I rock real hard 'cause I am the R.J.
