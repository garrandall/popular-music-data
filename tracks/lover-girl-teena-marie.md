Hee...

Sugar pop
Funky pops

Coffee, tea or me, baby, touché au lait
My opening line might be a bit passé, yes
But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, saw you

I need your love and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same
I'm for the real and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar, all I want to do is be your one and only lover

I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey...hey...hey...

Hook, line and sinker baby, that's how you caught me
My second verse might be a bit old hat
But don't think that I don't know what it's doing to me
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time you saw through me, through me

I need your love and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same
I'm for the real and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar, all I want to do is be your one and only lover

I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey...hey...hey...

I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey...hey...hey...

Baby, let me groove you
Let me groove into your love
I just want to be your lovergirl
Let me prove it to you
Baby, let me rock your world
I just want to rock your world

Baby, let me soothe you
Let me smooth into your love
I just want to be your lovergirl
Let me prove it to you
Baby, let me rock your world
I just want to rock your world

Coffee, tea or me, baby, touché au lait
My opening line might be a bit passé
But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, whoa

When the push comes to shove
And you need a little love
Let me put some rock into your world
Call me up don't be shy
For my love will make you high
I just want to be your lovergirl
