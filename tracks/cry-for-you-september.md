I never had to say goodbye
You must have known I wouldn't stay
While you were talking about our life
You killed the beauty of the today

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forevers gonna slow you down

You’ll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you

You'll never see me again
No matter what you do (X2)

You never heard me break your heart
You didn’t wake up when we died
Since I was lonely from the start
I think the end is mine to write

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forevers gonna slow you down

You'll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you

You'll never see me again
No matter what you do (X2)

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forevers gonna slow you down

You'll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you

You'll never see me again
No matter what you do (X2)
