Sleek, big cat
Bible black
Honeysuckle
I would never deny

The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get
The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get

Pass through the heat
Come on, come on and pass
Through the heat
Catch a thief
A honeythief
I am a thief
A honeythief

The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get
The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get

That's the price you pay
When love gets in the way
Stealth in the night
I come to steal
With stealth in the night
You got the sugar to satisfy
I am the man you can never deny

The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get
The light of deep regret
Let me see what I don't get
