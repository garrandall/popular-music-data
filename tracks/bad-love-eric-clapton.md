It's too bad I don't love you
For you have worried me night and day.
It's too bad I don't love you
For you have worried me night and day.
Till my heart begins to stammer
And my hair is turning gray.

It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good.
It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good.
You must be thinking, 'bout this time
That my poor heart is made of wood.

It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind.
It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind.
I want to stay around your circle
And learn to love you all the time.
