There once lived an Indian maid
A teenage Indian maid
Who heard one day her radio play
And the rock and roller stole her heart away

And now every single night
All around the campfire bright
All the braves they yearn just to take their turn
And dance with their heart's delight

Oh yeah, let's rock, rock tonight with Rockin' Red Wing
While the tom tom's wailin', her feet are sailin'
Oh yeah, let's rock, rock tonight with Rockin' Red Wing
A little Indian maiden loves to rock and roll

(Instrumental Break)

Her Father, Chief Standing Bear
Standing with a feather in his hair
And he taps his feet to the rock and roll beat
And says, 'Red Wing, your dance is mighty neat'

She dances up a prairie storm
Just to keep her little wigwam warm
And her little Brother, Max bought a new tenor sax
And man, can he blow that horn

Oh yeah, let's rock, rock tonight with Rockin' Red Wing
While the tom tom's playin', her feet are sailin'
Oh yeah, let's rock, rock tonight with Rockin' Red Wing
A little Indian maiden loves to rock and roll
