Great, I'm in trouble, I suppose because I does hit
Girlfriend, ya love me in my drop-top Rolls
Traffic came to a halt, I'm like
"I beg your pardon, madam, it was truly my fault"

And instead of a yellin' and add to no above
Hon', all in my drop dead gorgeous love
Pretty? Body definitely curvin' and thirdly
The way she dyed her hair bronze, fitted her superbly

Baby, let me say what's on my mind
Take a little time to express myself
Honey, I think you're fly

Now I don't have no problem sayin' what I like
I'd like to spend some time with you
Startin' with tonight and I like

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

Here's the situation, I lay it on the line
Meaningless relationships, they're wastin' all my time
You are the special someone that I wanna get to know
Baby, can't you see it in my eyes I wanna take you home?

Tonight let's take our time
Do it nice, do it slow
Baby, we got nowhere to go

Oh, I hope you don't mind
Oh, I'm comin' on real strong
I give good lovin' all night long, oh, I like it

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot

Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot
Make it hot Montell, make it hot

Tonight let's take our time
Do it nice, do it slow
Baby, we got nowhere to go

Oh, I hope you don't mind
Oh, I'm comin' on real strong
Give good lovin' all night long, oh, I like it

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

Baby, I like the way that you walk
And baby, I like the way that you talk
And baby, I'd like to kiss on your lips
And baby, I like you and baby, I like

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like

I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself, baby, I like
