I saw you standing hand in hand
And now you come to me the solitary man
And I know what it is that made us live
Such ordinary lives
The where to go the who to see
No one could sympathize
The Smile Has Left Your Eyes
The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

And I've become a rolling stone
I don't know where to go or what to call my own
But I can see that black horizon glooming
ever close to view
It's over now it's not my fault
See how this feels for you
The Smile Has Left Your Eyes
The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

But I never thought I'd see you
Standing there with him
So don't come crawling back to me

Now it's too late you realized
Now there's no one can sympathize
Now that the Smile Has Left Your Eyes
Now it's too late you realized
Now there's no one can sympathize
Now it's too late you realized
Now that the Smile Has Left Your Eyes
