It be young lloyd, and dem franchize boyz
We rippin it hard in them old school toys
Got my top down and my trunk out noise
We we turnin heads now
Where we pull em out
Young lloyd, and dem franchize boyz
We rippin it hard in them old school toys
We, we turnin heads
We, we turnin heads

She wanna
She wanna
She wanna

She wanna kick it in my pimped out chevrolet
The 28s with the candy paint
Steady clippin while I'm dippin
On the interstates, yeah she can't wait
Top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where I go
I guess I come upon strip and turn a couple heads, a couple heads, turn a couple heads


I'm in a 6 9 chevy-verk tudahuk dunt
Who we rhyme with?
Who knows?
Who I rhyme with?
My girl got a girlfriend
Yeah I do the those
28's on the wip verse
Wen I hit the block I turn heads like the N**** here
I'm still rolling
And the N**** still cruizing
Hoe's dun chose n Hoe's still choosing


She wanna kick it in my pimped out chevrolet
The 28s with the candy paint
Steady clippin while I'm dippin
On the interstates, yeah she can't wait
Top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where I go
I guess I come upon strip and turn a couple heads, a couple heads, turn a couple heads


I bet you turn heads wen u step out with pimpin
Like your main course and all you hear is cameras flickin
She ain't like a real g she dun really like a square
In the bed turnin' heads like a bottle o' jon
She got a nift on and she keep her hair fixed
28inches make it hard to stud a bitch
She got a man but shawty want some she wanna f***
We can keep it on the low haha


She wanna kick it in my pimped out chevrolet
The 28s with the candy paint
Steady clippin while I'm dippin
On the interstates, yeah she can't wait
Top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where I go
I guess I come upon strip and turn a couple heads, a couple heads, turn a couple heads


Women double take wen' they see me pushin' that foreign
New skool' buble but my old skool colour orange
Shoes from a distance wen they see me comin' up
Old skool big block 28's mounted up
Pull a stop *arrh* let the rim's spin
Rim's spin so hard wheel 3 chicks in
Yo we outie 30 like were we goin'?
On the E way destination unknown.


She wanna kick it in my pimped out chevrolet
The 28s with the candy paint
Steady clippin while I'm dippin
On the interstates, yeah she can't wait
Top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where I go
I guess I come upon strip and turn a couple heads, a couple heads, turn a couple heads


You can ride with' me shawty no sense of direction
Let me stick game to ya figure out your perfection
Do you like the base knocking?
Or the beat down low?
Do you get real sloppy?
Stroke the meat real slow?
Baby girl lemme' know so I know how to go
I like it slow and sloppy I dun' told you once before
Aye
Make no mistakes go on a dinner date
Can't wait we can get started on the interstate


She wanna kick it in my pimped out chevrolet
The 28s with the candy paint
Steady clippin while I'm dippin
On the interstates, yeah she can't wait
Top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where I go
I guess I come upon strip and turn a couple heads, a couple heads, turn a couple heads

Cause all I need to know
Is if your ridin with me baby
And anywhere we can go my lady
