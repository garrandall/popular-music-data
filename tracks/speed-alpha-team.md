Here he comes
Here comes Speed Racer
Here he comes
Here comes Speed Racer

He's a demon on wheels

Go, go, Speed, go
Go, go, go, Speed, go
Go, go, go, Speed
Go, go, go, Speed

Go, go, Speed, go
Go, go, go, Speed, go
Go, go, go, Speed
Go, go, go, Speed

Go, Speed, go

Somewhere deep in the
Hills of old bonnie Scotland

It was exactly one year ago
That Speed Racer and
His Mach Five defeated us
We swore that someday
We would get our revenge
That time is almost at hand

To win, we'll stop at nothing
Let's break that speed record
Let's break that speed record
Oh, Speed
Let's break that speed record
Let's break that speed record
Look out

L-L-L-Let's break that speed record
L-L-L-Let's break that speed record

Look out
Oh, Speed, are you alright

Uh huh, uh, ah, uh, ah...

Oh, Trixie
Oh, Speed, stop

Uh huh, uh, ah, uh, ah...

Oh, Speed
Here he comes
Here comes Speed Racer

Uh huh, uh, ah, uh, ah...

Trixie, oh, Speed
Trxie, Speed...
You were wonderful

Here he comes
Here comes Speed Racer
He's a demon on wheels

Go, Speed Racer
Go, Speed Racer
Go, Speed Racer, go
