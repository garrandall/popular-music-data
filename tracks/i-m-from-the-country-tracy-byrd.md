Way back up in the country, back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Livin' with the crazzies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
That's where I'm from and I'm proud to say
I'm from the country and I like it that way


Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes, come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way


All day long we work in the fields
Then bring it on home to a home cooked meal
We love ya like Sunday, treat ya like Saturday night
And when the beds get full we can sleep in the hay (Hey)
We're from the country and we like it that way


Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way

Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country
We're from the country
We're from the country
And we like it that way
