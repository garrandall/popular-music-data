I've got your picture
Of me and you
You wrote "I love you"
I wrote "Me too"
I sit there staring, and there's nothing else to do
Oh, it's in colour
Your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel
And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around


I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of you, all 'round my cell
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up and turning down
And turning in and turning 'round


I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so


I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of you, all 'round my cell
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up and turning down
And turning in and turning 'round


I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so


No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women
No fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark
Everyone around me is a total stranger
Everyone avoids me like a cyclone ranger, everyone


That's why I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so




Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so (Think so, think so, think so)
I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so (Think so, think so, think so)
