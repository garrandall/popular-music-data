Over and over
I tell you that I love you
It's over and over and over
I told you I miss you

Like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
I know, I know, I know
(What you sow, what you sow)

You're my lover girl
And I'm your lover boy
Love is no game
Let's not take it for a toy

It's like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
(What you sow, what you sow)

Can't you understand the things
The things we have planned
For the years, years to come

It's hard to believe
You, you deceived me
Baby, baby, baby
Please come back home

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Over and over and over
I told you I love you
It's over and over and over
I told you I miss you

It's like, it's like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
(What you sow, what you sow)
I know, I know, I know
(What you sow, what you sow)
