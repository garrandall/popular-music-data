I went up the levee to pack some sacks
And I thought I'd bring me some money back.
Big boat up the river and she can't come down.
My woman on the levee wearing a frown.

Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down

Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come down

Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river blowing loud and fast
If she don't get to deep water she'll never land
And my woman on the levee shaking her hand,
She thinks she's gonna quit me for another man

Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down

Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come down

Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river blowing loud and fast
And my woman on the levee feeling mighty sad
She thinks I got the money that I once had had
But when I get her home it's gonna be too bad.

Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down

Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come down
