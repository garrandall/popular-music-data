Last night I let the party get the best of me
Waking up in the morning
Two hoes laying next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks
That's the motherfucking recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's going down in this bitch
Concrete

We gon' party all night
No sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everything is on me

The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high
We don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key (TGOD)

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar
Everytime I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playing with us

They just paying enough
Man them niggas ain't ballin, they just laying it up
Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed up
While on my way to the club
I had to wait at the club
But now I don't 'cause everything is on me

The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high
We see the whole street
We fly, I mean so high
We need a whole wing (TGOD)

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, I
