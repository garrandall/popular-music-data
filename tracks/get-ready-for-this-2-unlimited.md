Ya'll ready for this?

Get down with the sound, house on the ground
Please when I squeeze, drop to your knees
You must have bet I'm in here to stay
Ready to take you around the way
So get ready for this, mind your own biz
Cause I invented the microphone biz
No need to sit, cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this!

Feel the bass, you just get closer
Be impressed by the words I chose so
Once again kicking it live
Doing everything yo just to survive
Above the law, I take our stand
Being on stage with a mic in my hand
Busting it loud to the crowd
The age is 20, I'm from the south!

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in get ready for this
We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sit?
Moving up and down, dancing all around
Feeling kinda free; security
House is sound that moves you from the ground

House on the ground, bass in your face
Racing the place, no time to waste
Being hypnotised, I can see it in your eyes
Feeling kinda better, put on your sweater
Being black or white, I think it doesn't matter
Super, dope, def, and even outrageous
If I was an animal, they'dve kept me in cages
So get ready for this!

Ya'll ready for this?

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in get ready for this
We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sit?
Moving up and down, dancing all around
Feeling kinda free; security
House is sound that moves you from the ground
