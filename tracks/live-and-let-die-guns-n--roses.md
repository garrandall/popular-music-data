When you were young
and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
you know you did
you know you did
you know you did
But if this ever changing world
in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When ya got a job to do
Ya got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
you know you did
you know you did
you know you did
But if this ever changing world
in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
