Freedom, freedom let me go

Do you want to know me?
I would like to know you
Do you want to talk to me?
I would like to talk to you

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

If you don't trust me
I'm never gonna trust you
If you don't try to understand me
I'll never understand you

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

I'm talking about freedom
Do you want to know me?
I'm talking about freedom
I would like to know you
Talking about freedom
Oh let me go

If you take my eyes
I'll still be watching you
And if you take my voice
I'll still hear me saying

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

I wanna take you there
Oh baby talking about freedom everywhere
Freedom for you, freedom for me
Freedom, freedom
Let me go, let me go, let me go

I want it now, I want it now, I want freedom
Love and understanding
Oh talking about freedom, talk about it
Just love talking about freedom again
Freedom, let me go
Don't let it hold you back
