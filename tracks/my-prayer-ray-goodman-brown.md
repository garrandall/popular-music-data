When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

My prayer (My prayer)
Is a rapture in bloom (Rapture in bloom)
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know

Woo... oh.. oh. ohoh oh.ohoh...oh...oh

My prayer (My prayer)
And the answer you give (Answer you give)
May they still be the same
For as long as we live

That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer (My prayer)
