I've seen the light
And I've seen the flame
And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again

For I've been refused
And I've been regained
And I've seen your eyes before
And I'm sure to see your eyes again
Once again

For I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've sung my song before
And I'm sure to sing my song again
Once again

Some people got to laugh
Some people got to cry
And some people got to make it through
By never wondering why

Some people got to sing
Some people got to sigh
Some people never see the light
Until the day they die

But I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again
Once again
One more time again
Just one more time
