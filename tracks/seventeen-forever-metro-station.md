You were young, and so am I
And this is wrong, but who am I to judge?
I feel like heaven when we touch
I guess, for me this is enough


We're one mistake for being together
Let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

You are young and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years but I don't care
And I can feel your heartbeat
You know exactly where to take me



Will you remember me?
You ask me as I leave
Remember what I said?
Oh how could I, oh how could I forget?
