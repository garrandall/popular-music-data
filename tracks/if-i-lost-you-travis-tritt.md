There's been times I've felt like half a man
Life had me down on my knees
Troubled times I don't understand
Why they happen to me
I have struggled through the dark ness
And I have found the light of day

But if I lost you
There'd be no sun shine shinin through
I don't know what in the world I would do
If I lost you

Like a ship with no harbor, 
Like a bird with no wings, 
Like a fish out of water, 
A dreamer without a dream, 
I have learned about losing 
I could lose most n e thing,

But if I lost you
There'd be no sun shine shinin through
I don't know what in the world I would do
If I lost you
