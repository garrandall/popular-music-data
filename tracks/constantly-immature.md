Constantly
Constantly
Constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind


At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I cant get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
Often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend


If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you


Constantly
I've got you on my mind (Constantly babe)
Constantly
And not just all the time, i think about you
Constantly
If you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind


I practice my words
And I build up the nerve
But uh
Words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye
Time after time
Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind


If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you


Constantly
Your always on my mind
Constantly
And not just all the time, I think about you
Constantly
Oh if you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind

I think about you baby

Your always on my mind
Constantly (OoOh Yeah Constantly Baby)
Constantly (Whoa I think about you, I think about you)
Constantly (When I wake up in the morning, When I go to bed at night..)
Constantly (I think about you all the time, Constantly your on my mind)
Constantly (yeah yeah yeah, constantly I want you baby, please come to me)
