You keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it
You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is 

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now 
Because I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no 

You wear a plastic smile
I know by you eyes
You speak with indefinite style
You're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me
Why can't you free your honesty

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now 
Because I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no
