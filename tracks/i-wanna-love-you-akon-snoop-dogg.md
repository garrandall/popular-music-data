Konvict, Konvict Music, and you know we up front

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know


Money in the air as more feel
Grab you by your coattail
Take you to the motel, hoe sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say I don't talk Dogg
Unless you told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me
What the flick gon' do
Baby stick to me
And I'mma stick on you
If you pick me
Then I'mma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip riding the poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life


I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you looking at me now
What is gon' be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl


Mobbin' through the club in low pressing
I'm sitting in the back in the smokers section
(just smoking)
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you
(baby I see you)
It's cool we jet the mood is set
Your pussy is wet
You're rubbing your back and touching your neck
Your body is movin' you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin' and grinnin' and looking at me


Girl and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty
The type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl
