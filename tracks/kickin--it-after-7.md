When I look in your eyes I see a reflection of me
Being there for you whenever you need me
I can't describe my soul feelin' so deep for you girl it's like a dream come
True
You are my everything

I won't ever leave you, or desert you
I won't risk the good things that we have in life , oh girl
Its important to me, for you to trust me baby
Cause I'm givin' my all and all to you right now
Just right, tonight, I wanna love you down

I'll never ever leave you alone and confused
That's one thing that you'll never have to think twice about baby
Don't mind kickin' it with you (kickin' it with you)

But lately I been thinkin' your the only one that's right for me

Your my girl, and I can't see myself givin' you to somebody else
Its so impossible
Whenever you need a friend
I'll be there to the end
I'm the way I am and your just stuck with me girl

You know it's true
Cause for you, I wanna do most everything
Oh girl you've got my heart, in the palm of your hand
I've been waiting for the right time to show you how I feel
Tonight, just right, I wanna love you down

But lately I been thinkin' your the only one that's right for me
