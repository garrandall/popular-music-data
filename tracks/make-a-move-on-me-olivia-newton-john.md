I can tell you got plans for me
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully
But tonight I have to say there just might be another way
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms
I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm the one you want, that's all I wanna be
So come on baby make a move on me
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free
So come on baby make a move on me tonight
I can't wait, I can't wait

You made the prettiest speech I've heard
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words
To a heart that's open wide and from the start was on your side
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms
I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm the one you want, that's all I wanna be
So come on baby make a move on me
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free
So come on baby make a move on me tonight
I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm the one you want, that's all I wanna be
So come on baby make a move on me
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free
So come on baby make a move on me tonight
I can't wait, I can't wait
