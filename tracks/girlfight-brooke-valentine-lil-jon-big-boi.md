So when you hear us pull up bring ya butt outside
And if you try to call ya cousin and nem

In the middle of the dance floor now they preparing to scrap
They takin out their scrunchies and pullin' off their pressons
The one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is the other woman
Someone please call security

Come outside, uh, come outside, uh
We down to ride
It's about to be a... Girlfight!
