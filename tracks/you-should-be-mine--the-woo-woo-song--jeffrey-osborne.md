Ooh...Ooh

When you wants all the lu you deserve and the heat's on your mind.
Don't you even think about it.
I'll be there just a wrapped around you.
I can't hold back what I feel inside.
It's just a fact that

You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Should be mine, all mine.

Any way that your heart has been denied.
Ooh, you can come to me.
Every time that we're together just confirms the good thing we've got.
And something this good can't be defined.
One things for sure, that

You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Should be mine, all mine.
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Should be mine, all mine.

In the height of your worry
Where it's running too deep for you.
When it all comes too much, too much, too much.
I'll pull you through.

I can't hold back, what I know inside.
It's just a fact that

You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
You should be mine, anything you want.
You got to fortify my love to fortify me.
Can you woo-woo-woo?
(You should be mi-i-i-ine)
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Should be mine, all mine.

Can you woo-woo-woo?
(You should be mi-i-i-ine)
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Can you woo-woo-woo?
Should be mine, all mine.

Ooh...Oh, Oh...Ooh
(You should be mi-i-i-ine)
Ooh...Oh, Oh...Ooh
(You should be mi-i-i-ine)


Ooh...Oh, Oh...Ooh
