I think we got somethin'
Hey, It's my girl Hannah
And Iyaz on the track right now
Hey, Let's go

Tonight were gonna get this
Tonight were gonna get this
Tonight were gonna get this
Were gonna get this
Were gonna get this


I can here you cranking up them speakers
I don't really wanna show up any later
Because soon were gonna party like it's new years

Yo I'm loving all the music that they're playin'
But I ain't hearin' anything you're sayin'
Today were gonna get this gonna live exquisite
Oh oh, Oh oh
(put your hands up)

Somebody dance beside me
'Cause I'm feelin' good at this party
Yeah, I'm fly just like Bob Marley
So here we go again, just turn it up


Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie

This girl, this girl, this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie


I can see you hangin' out in the corner
Lookin fly and you finally comin' over
I've been checkin' out ya, but you didn't notice
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Yeah I did and it's really nice to meet ya
1,2,3 could you smile for a picture?
Today were gonna get this, gonna really live it
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Somebody just said
"Hannah, do you already have a man
'Cause I'm smooth like Carlos Santana"

Well here we go boy, just crank it up


Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie

This girl this girl this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie


Yeah I'm gonna sing my melody
If ya wanna join in go ahead and sing
We can dance all night baby you and me
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Celebrate with everybody
Have a crazy good time
Yeah the time of our lives
Oh Oh, Oh Oh


Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
(We're gonna get this, my boy)
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie

This girl this girl this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie
(Everybody)
