(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
Oh yes, my roof's got a hole in it and I might drown

There was a crooked man and he had a crooked smile
Had a crooked sixpence and he walked a crooked mile
Had a crooked cat and he had a crooked mouse
They all lived together in a crooked little house

(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
Oh yes, my roof's got a hole in it and I might drown

Well, this crooked little man and his crooked little smile
Took his crooked sixpence and he walked a crooked mile
Bought some crooked nails and a crooked little bat
Tried to fix his roof with a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat

(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
Oh yes, my roof's got a hole in it and I might drown

Now this crooked little man and his crooked cat and mouse
They all live together in a crooked little house
Has a crooked door with a crooked little latch
Has a crooked roof with a crooked little patch

(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
Oh yes, my roof's got a hole in it and I might drown

(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it, my roof's got a hole in it
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
