Here I am
On my own
It gets hard sometimes
When I'm travelling this empty world all alone
And I get tired
And oh, I get oh so weak
And I need for someone to come rescue me

To help me along
To catch when I miss
To show me where I ought to be
So I can be strong
And face all of this
That my life tries to discourage me with

With a little luck will I find you
And if I do
Is it you who'll make my dreams come true
Just a little bit of happiness
Is all that I wish
And I hope that you can grant me this

When I look
At my life
Oh, and where I've been
And I wonder if this story has a happy ending
Like they always do
But if my wish comes true
I just hope and pray I always can depend on you

To help me along
To catch when I miss
To show me where I ought to be
So I can be strong
And face all of this
That my life tries to discourage me with

With a little luck will I find you
And if I do
Is it you who'll make my dreams come true
Just a little bit of happiness
Is all that I wish
And I hope that you can grant me this

With a little luck will I find you
And if I do
Is it you who'll make my dreams come true
Just a little bit of happiness
Is all that I wish
And I hope that you can grant me this

With a little luck will I find you
And if I do
Is it you who'll make my dreams come true
Just a little bit of happiness
Is all that I wish
And I hope that you can grant me this
