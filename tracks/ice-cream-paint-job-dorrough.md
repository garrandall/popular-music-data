This time I say yeah buddy live good eat good old school chevy to a
Cadillac fleetwood got the inside (black) and the outside (black) thinking bout a maserati but I'd rather ride lac AC blow like windchill paint drippin like the rain on the windshield


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job


Mama black daddy black uncle black granny black catch me in a caddilac
Say ridin' on a full tank with some ice cream paint got the shoes and the hat to match
My car yeah we stunt like that
Down in Dallas Texas yeah it's crunk like that
All I got to do is this drop the top and show the wrist
And I can pull a bad bitch off eye contact
Yeah it's your boy dorrough I got a woodgrain wheel and a woodgrain flow
Paint job fresh paint
Pop trunk my way
Yeah buddy I'm paid
And everybody know
To get money is the mission
It's the autocar magicain
09 but I drive a 012 expedition
With an auto start enigition
Four 15s hittin
With a sign on the back that say let's go fishin


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job


I'm ridin clean on the northside staight from the south
Collipark to be is at where niggas known for showin out
Throwin out about 30 on top of the sticker price
And when we hit that old gold nigga got a lil twite
Nigga got a lil swag cause my shit so nice
If you ain't lookin at the rims then you blinded by the ice
I ain't talkin bout the shit around my wrist nah
Talkin bout this here all around to gets you
I think I got the coldest car game in the city
Fuck ridin stock I'm off the lot lookin pretty
I got your mouth dropped saying
He ain't do that did he
Nigga yes I did nigga yes I did
I got the chrome wheels black
Lil peanut butter dash
Six speed with the chip muthafucka fast
Love it when you niggas run up on me it's trash
Switch lanes fast with a dash
And keep ridin


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job


Yeah shawty
Soulja boy big dog
Black on black lamborghini ice cream paint job
Black card bank card
So much money look like I had the bank robbed
My flow cajan
Spicy punch line
Disrespect me and get jumped like the lunch line
Titanic swag like I'm standing on a boat
Man yours boys got money but your flows still broke
No pad no pen I'm going in
Flyin' down the highway blowin on the kush again
I'm gettin' money like I never would believe
So many tattoos that my skin can't breathe
I'm gettin' old money but I'm a youngster
My swag presidental make obama want to sponsor me


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job


Splash candy bone
I'm drippy
Car so clean that the paint look slippery
Caught the swag fruit so I got these niggas sickened
Call me ice cream the way the girls start lickin me
Licorice shovled the way she diggin me
Victory
Just the dick in me
In my game flag
Make the nasty girls get with me
And after I tell her it's all history
Chickens (chickens)
Rotisserie (rotisserie)
We could make it snow
Motherfucka better get your skis
Told her turn it up as I hit the speed
Pushed the head down
Waters bone as I hit the weave


Yeah buddy
Cup stay muddy
Everywhere I go bops stop and study
Clean on the inside cream on the outside
Your queen on the inside and the outside boss wide
Your realationship over
Better stay high never see me sober
Late night you can find me and high rollers
Servin our sodas
We slow-mo pourers
Everybody know us
Hoe game famous
Got money out the anus
But it ain't change us
Still keep it hood
Candy caddi on rollas
Excuse the marijuana officer we smokas


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job


When the haters see me pullin up
They want to bust in my tank
Cause they lactose intolerant
I got to much ice cream paint
When my car be dancin they got challenge I got handles I got balance
And my audio system pioneers
Got the sound surroundin'
Pullin out a block
Lookin at my watch
She asked me for the time
I said 20 gee o'clock
Double finger on my heckler and cocked
I ride ready
Banana split chevy so wet it look sweaty
Interior red like sauce on spaghetti
I'm havin my bread mane I'm in it kind of heavy
Already drunk on the outside
Finna go inside
Took the bopper outside
Bout to go inside


Rollin with my doors up
Hoppin off the intersection
Tryna drivin direct
IPhone text
Austropentual rolex watch face
Mama told me turn it down that's too much bass
Supreme orange soda cream
Seats bucket
So clean on the outside groupies love it
I'm in dallas with my cowboy cheerleader
Blowin big sippin kool-aid out a 2 liter
Chrome features big sneakers rollin' sideways
Aye bay bay I been ballin' for bout 5 days
My ice cream paint job flows like my wrist
I keep my top down so groupies won't forget


Cream on the inside clean on my outside 
Ice cream paint job
