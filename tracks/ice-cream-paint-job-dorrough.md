Huh-huh, yo Mister D-O-Double-R


I say yeah buddy, rollin' like a big shot
Chevy tuned up like a NASCAR pitstop (Yeah)
Fresh paint job (check) fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame and the trunk wide? (Yes)
Are the rims big? (what?) Do it ride good? (good)
Lean back, right hand on the pinewood


Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job


Woo! Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, ice cream paint job (paint job)
Got screens on the dash, watching Saved by the Bell
Got a house by the bayside (bayside)
Yeah, I'm livin' like that
And I'm ridin' like that (like that)
Boy I'm ridin' like that
And the steerin' wheel wood like a baseball bat
Just like Archie said, "We ready"
Whole clique straight lunatics like Nelly
Grand Marquis' paint job grape jelly
R triple BC, big black box Chevy
Crank my car, she be hummin'
Rims so big, you can see me coming
Prime Time Click, we get money
Stay iced up like TV Johnny


Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job


I'm live (I'm live) like a Superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lot of niggas pissed off
Yeah paint shine like lip gloss
Cadillac got a wide body like Rick Ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it, I'mma buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like Kimbo Slice
Be around tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims alright
That right thurr, C.C. I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt-cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark (Like what?)
ARGH, ARGH, like Q-Dawgs
Prime Time Click make it move like U-Haul


Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job


I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk, 4 screen's in the deck
I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk, 4 screen's in the deck
I ride (I ride) I ride, (I ride)
I ride (I ride) let's ride (let's ride)
I ride (propped up) I ride (propped up)
I ride (say bro) let's ride (let's ride)
I gotta fresh paint job (check) fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame and the trunk wide? (Yes)
Are the rims big? (what?) do it ride good? (good)
Lean back, right hand on the pinewood


Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job
