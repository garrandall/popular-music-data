That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down

Daddy said, "Now come girl
We're headed down the road to Augusta"
And frankly through his clenched teeth
He called Mama's name and then he cussed her

He said, "Girl, you're young
But some dude has come along and stole your mother"
But you can't steal a willin' mind
'Cause mama's always lookin' for a lover

That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down

With dusty teardrops on his face
My daddy cried and big steps he was takin'
Halfway runnin' to keep up
My shorter legs were so tired and shakin'

"Where did I go wrong, girl?
Why would she leave us both this way?"
At times like these, a child of ten
Never knows exactly what to say

That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down

We searched in every barroom
An' honky-tonk as well
An' finally daddy found them
And Lord, you know, the rest is hard to tell

He sent me out to wait
But scared I looked back through the door
An' daddy left them both
Soakin' up the sawdust on the floor

That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
