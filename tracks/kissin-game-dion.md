Every kiss I ever kissed you
Darling, came from my heart
But your love was just a play
And the things I heard you say
Were all a part

Of the kissing game
(The kissing game)
The kissing game
(The kissing game)

Yeah, the game, baby
Where you just played at love

Oh, you never really loved me
Though you kissed me each night
You were looking for some fun
And I guess just anyone
To hold you tight

In the kissing game
(The kissing game)
Mmm, the kissing game
(The kissing game)

Yeah, a game, baby
Where you just played at love

Don't you know you
Shouldn't go with some guy
Just because he looks
Good to the crowd
Use his love for a stepping stone
Baby, don't feel proud

Because some day you're gonna cry
When you meet someone who
Will pour water on your flame
And play the kissing game
Mmm, with you

Don't you know you
Shouldn't go with some guy
Just because he looks
Good to the crowd
Use his love for a stepping stone
Baby, now, don't you feel proud

He'll pour water on your flame
And play the kissing game with you

Ah, the kissing game
The kissing game
Ah, that kissing game
That kissing game
