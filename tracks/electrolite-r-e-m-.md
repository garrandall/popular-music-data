Your eyes are burnin' holes through me
I'm gasoline
I'm burnin' clean

20th century, go to sleep
You're plasticine
That is obscene
That is obscene

You are the star tonight
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

If I ever want to fly
Mulholland Drive
I am alive

Hollywood is under me
I'm Martin Sheen
I'm Steve McQueen
I'm Jimmy Dean

You are the star tonight
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

If you ever want to fly
Mulholland Drive
Up in the sky

Stand on a cliff and look down there
Don't be scared
You are alive
You are alive

You are the star tonight
You shine electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're outta sight

20th century, go to sleep
Really deep
We won't blink

Your eyes are burnin' holes through me
I'm not scared
I'm outta here
I'm not scared
I'm outta here
