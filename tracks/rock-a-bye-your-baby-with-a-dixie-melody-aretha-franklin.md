Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody. 
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie. 
Just place my cradle, mammy mine, 
Right on the Mason Dixon line, 
And swing it from Virginia 
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya. 

Weep no more, my lady. 

Sing that song again for me. 
Soft and low, just as though 
You had me on your knee. 

A million baby kisses I'd deliver, 
If you would only sing that Swanee River. 
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody
