There she sits all alone, her tear begins to shed
A written letter in her hand, this is how it read:

Turned sixteen just yesterday (ooh-ooh-ooh)
All my world was bright and gay (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Thought for sure you'd write or call but you didn't after all
Got the happy birthday blues (happy birthday blues)
Maybe you had lots to do (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Or you found somebody new (ooh-ooh-ooh)
How i pray you'll hear my plea, i'm as lonely as can be
Got the happy birthday blues (happy birthday blues)
I planned just how this day would be for such a long, long time
You'd wish me "happy birthday" while i held your hand in mine
I'd blow out all the candles while i wished that you and i
Would be together ever more until the day we die
As i sit here in the gloom (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Of my cold and lonely room (ooh-ooh-ooh)
How my heart is filled with fears and my eyes are filled with tears
Got the happy birthday blues (happy birthday blues)
