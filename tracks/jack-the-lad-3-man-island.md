K, I'm back, and I've made a few calls
Made a track that will break a few rules
Never mind Marvel, this could be
The most ambitious crossover event in history

Fighting for the title are a hundred different faces
Some of us are great at this and some of us are failures
Some are total strangers, some will be your favorites
But only one of us is HowToBasic!


It's a bird, it's a plane
The sky's gonna fall!
Psych! I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!


Parachute down no time to waste
Head straight for the bushes (Quick)
Dreaming of the gun that I can't locate
So instead I get bludgeoned


I landed in tilted towers
The cowards shot me in the ass, directly in the trousers


I'm in tilted towers and like Austin Powers
I bang everyone for hours, golden bullet showers


Standing right in the landing site
Popping shots off at anybody rambling by


I'm in the zone, looking for a spot to hide
When I was sniped by a guy
On a drive-by rocket ride


Caught in a storm and I'm running away
I never should have landed here in Flush Factory


I'm swinging through the rooftop without any pause
Like a full on criminal version of Santa Claus


I play Fortnite with my eyes
I play Fortnite with my chin
I play Fortnite with my cheeks
I play Fortnite with my teeth


Hey man, got a gun for me?
God damn, ain't gonna give you one for free
Can't you lend a bandage or potion to me?
Crazy, I babysit everyone with me


*Baby Babbling*


You won't find me when I hide in the trees
'Til I leap up high, get sniped in the knees


Can't handle the heat? Get out the Pub, G
I'll serve you like a battle royale with cheese


I don't really play Fortnite, you see
Personally, I prefer PUBG


Drop on the map then I plot my attack
Strapped with a rocket attached
I am not full of crap
I'ma pop me a cap
Then build like Frank Lloyd Wright
Hopped up on crack


O king do sportrap, to na track
Selvagem como leao, bro respect
O mundo em conexao, click clack
Canal em explosao, B. Black


In this game you can never relax
(Never Relax, Never Relax)
That's why we rap on the heaviest tracks


Fuck crafting, I never craft
If you craft you're a daft lad
Don't make me laugh, Dad
All I need is guns, Rat Tat Tatta Tat Tat
Try to keep up, Granddad, God I'm a badass


Rushea a tu gusto pero ten algo de cura
Que ni tendiendo un arbusto pero ten algo de cura


No podras contra mi fuego ni mi habilidad
Pediras ayuda pero no tendre piedad


Tried to use a bandage as a band aid
But I got minxed up, and it was a grenade


Well I'm new to Fortnite and I'm excited to play
But when I type "LFG," they reply "Go Away"


Modern Warfare had 15 Mil
I was number one, so you'll be easy to kill


Can't land shots but I know how to build
Gonna stay in here 'til the rest get killed


Gold SCAR make them ladies wet
Higher than a launch pad, not a dang regret


Did a rocket ride and seen these cowards fled
But then I fell too high so now I'm dead


Grabbed some coffee while I wait for the game to boot
But now I'm dead and shoot, they saw the good loot


Find my spot, scope's on you
Line up shot, fall off roof


Meu time chegou agora
Vamos detonar e hora
Somos os melhores pegando cada abate
No topo do topo, vencendo no fortnite


Armado ate o pescoco, eu vou descarregar o pente
Replay dando headshot, gringo nao fica contente


Voy arrasando como un ciclon
Destroyzando todo escuadron


Vente compadre ya no hay nadie que me pare
Cuando comienza la party se me ponen a bailar
Todo el mundo mira con las manitas arriba
Como me corono el rey, del Battle Royale


Empieza la batalla, hay que tener agallas
Salto en pisos picados a matar como cabron
Soy el peque y tengo que dar la talla para
Matar a todos y quedar el fucking campeon


Click, boom, voce caiu no chao
Click, clack, sou foco na missao
Yuri black, grave o nome eu sou pressao
Comigo na batalhe vai direto pro caixao


Um Battle Royale em evolucao
Matar todo mundo e fazer contrucao


Mais opnestes que cairam
So eu no fim restou
E pouca fala e muita bala
E meu estilo, plow


Tras la tormenta, todos los que quedan, se ponen a llorar
Â¡Que solo puede qudar uno, no te mientas!
Esto es un todo o nada, dejo sin aliento
A cualquiera desde mi rampa tu sigues dando vueltas
No puedes esconderte aqui tu destino es la muerte
Naci preparado para Â¡Fortnite! pirate
Tengo todos los tesoros y las armas que tu buscas
Te mato de frente Â¡boom! mira mi nivel


Walls, walls, got no balls
But just like Trump, I'm building walls


Hi, I'm Dave from BoyinaBand
Now I'm dead, Duckety Duck!


With Young Thug drinking a chug jug
We found a chest in the back of a dump truck


Trying to avoid every shotgun pop
I build a big wall like I'm Donald Trump


I'm coming through with my mini-gun gun
Dum diddy dum diddy diddy dum dum


I'm SHOT IN THE HINEY
SOMEONE REVIVE ME!


Gunning for you, say your Ave Maria
With guns, grenades, an entire IKEA


I'm haphazardly running across the island
There's a firefight right on the horizon
And got a white revolver and I'm frightened
But look a bush, hey perfect timing
Only safe place, in the whole game
Do I feel shame? No way!


I don't play nice, I do all the damage
Make our first night and give me a bandage


I'm the last man hiding in a hedge
'Cause I quite like to live life right on the edge


I like living on the edge, quite literally
I've been camped by the storm as shrubbery


You see me walking inside a dank shrubbery


I'm about to get in the middle of lucky landing
Hit them with a wiggle they giggling when I'm dancing
Swivelling and jiggle my booty it never stop
'Til the C4 blows and the bodies go Pop


See you building them stairs
When I shoot, you block
So I go to bust them down
With a smooth smooth chop
Come around the way with that 22. Glock
Boom boom pop
Now I got that loot you dropped


(I don't even need, like, any of the weapons)
(Just like a medkit, and a bandage... and a stone)
I can win a battle royale with no weapons
All I need is a bandage to smash your whole head in


I missed the Raven Skin, and now I'm crying
Slept on it too? Mufasa, you lying


I'm throwing up new Stabs
Whenever you flex
I turn the battleground into a Duplex


So who's next for a round in the head?
You're mine now b-
Ah, dammit. I'm dead


Okay right, it's been five minutes
And I haven't found a gun, well I guess I'm finished


Triggering the explosive remote
Then I provoke you with a cheeky emote


Here lies B.C dying on a hill
Never found one gun, never got one kill


No B.C, are you like gone for real?
I'm undone, I'll just hide in this spot until


When I spray at a rate better pray hard
I'm The Living Tombstone, you're laying in a graveyard


Fresh Prince running man on your tombstone
The hardest working carpenter you know


Yo permanezco oculto en un arbusto, a gusto
Y espero al momento a justo a dar un susto brusco


I need help, I need more ordinance
But I don't know how to tell my co-ordinates


When I see your head then I let the lead fly
(LEGENDARY)
I don't need to hide
I'm a maniac, but I keep control
I'ma roam with a gun for your booty hole


Tengo destreza mi don es bestial
Uso la tecnica para liquidar
A todos aquellos que vienen de chulos
Son unos carrulos que voy a matar


Desde lo alto voy directamente
A los juegos del hambre sin un escuadron
Equipate el culo, pienso matar uno
Por uno ocupand, el francotirador


Agarro mi Scar-L dorada, regargo
Y disparo balazo en tu frente, Â¡te he dado!


Mis rimas se arriman mas que un buen disparo
Te ataco en sigilo con mucho descaro


Celebro bailando sobre tu cuerpo
La victoria es mia, Â¡estad atentos!


Wait, is this the right server?


Nada me para, ni balas lanzadas
Directamente de tu RPG
Quieren pararme y no saben que hacer
Saikore llega a salty empieza a correr


Forget the guns, forget the parts
Forget the storm, I want to dance


It's not the winning it's the taking part
But I spent my day spectating, ah


The game may be free to play
But Chad Wild Clay gonna make you pay
Gonna take a grenade that I got from Loot Lake
Gonna paint these walls, with your brains


Well I got a few kills and it went to my head
So I check one text, look back and I'm dead (aw)


Y no creas que en Espanol es diferente
Corre a copia construye y muere


Fa fa fa, baby
Yeah I'm back, it's tejbz
Fortnite is my jam, play with ninja chat spam


My fort's a Ferrari, built by a genius


I'm not retarded, just a little bit Swedish


Drinking my shield juice, wait, grenade
I'm gonna die 'cause my buttons all hate me


Give me a golden sniper
You'll be crying to get a new diaper


So much wood they cannot show it in theatres


Pick up the sniper, shoot it through your head
A bullet flying past me, loot up 'cause you're dead
I've got one HP left, yeah, that's what I call getting tilted


Duck and roll quick 'cause I'm looking for cover
But was hit so much that I couldn't recover


Is that a quick scope? I'm not aiming for your ribs
Give me a scar, give me a trophy
I'm the Boy Who Lived


Yo, it's Sav, I'm a noob on Fortnite
And it took me a fooking fortnight
To figure out what to do on Fortnite
These bastards shoot in a sword fight


Tell the truth or at least don't lie
(AKIRA) I never played Fortnite


Nhay xÆ°á»ng ngoi nha chay vao ben trong
Giáº¿t hÃ©t tÃ¡t ca roi nÃºp vao ben hong
Tang mÃ³t diÃªu nhay han bi ha gá»¥c
Cam khau scar ban se thay nha ao thuáº­t


Truth is, I haven't even heard of Fortnite
But if Dan Bull says 'Collab?' you say 'Alright'


I don't even know what Fortnite is
But it sounds like a bunch of lame kids
Having a slumber party
And building forts with the couch cushions
I'm just playing, it's a game
With a bunch of lucky button pushers


Yo, snipe from my house on Loot Lake
You're injured
I'll be the one to shoot Drake
With Ninja


Fortnite, been playing it for two weeks
Don't shoot me, my character's too weak


To leave you bleeding's my mission
In the Fatal Fields in the foetal position


Repping that John Wick, shooting like a lunatic
Better run for cover if you see me with the boomstick


Como una metralla que no falla en la batalla
Te dispara ratatata matando a los canallas
Contra mi fuego ni mi habilidad
Ayuda pero no tendre piedad


Entro en combate armas prepraradas
Soy una sniper muy bien entrenada


Con la scar no me das no veras la skin del camara-da
Miedo mi escuadron matando solo granadas


Sniper calibrada vejo o vacilao na mira
Mais um pra conta menos um na partida


A minha mira e a certeza da garantida vitoria
No final estou de pe concretizando minha gloria


Estilo sniper, mato meu opnente a distancia
A espada afiada que corta sua arrogancia


Eu cheguei pra vencer, voce vai me entreter
Meu gailho e veloz e ninguem pode prever


Eu vou prevalecer
Voce jamais ira vencer
Vem peitar o guuh A.S.C.
Se eu chego na batalha game over pra voce


Better watch out when I come in for a push
Make your whole squad cry when I shush them with a bush


You've been hit with a Brit Spitfire
And I'm gonna get higher, then I'll retire


Came bringin' pain and I came to reclaim
Make it rain in the game when I aim at your frame


Tracing back and forth, we're never lacking forts
Suggest running 'cause we're coming like the Eye of the Storm


Cut my way through a roof, fell three floors
Now I look like a flat Diana Dors


Full shields with a gold SCAR
And I'm in first place with only two bars


I get big chugs, she's got big jugs
She'll be slipping on my juices, call me wailing wood


Let me do a little dance for you as I reach out
Got me looking like crab walk as I bleed out


Sneak up you won't hear me coming round
You can call that a Miracle of Sound


My squad is blind to the drama
Yeah we're gonna find all the Llamas


Look bitch, I'm not cheating, you're lagging
Stay and spectate as I bag 'em and tag 'em


Smashers, takers, blasters, flingers
Get the rocket in the middle finger


Creep through, lethal, battle most regal
If I peep you, then it's Sayonara Weeaboo


Entro en escena la verdad como una lunatico
Voy a esconderme ya veras yo juego tactico
Se nos cierra la tormenta tio pero no me achanta
Preparo los misiles, sora, salta


Surco el vaso mapa o lomos de este misil
Â¿Cientos contra mi? Mejor que sean mil
Este duo es imparable la victoria magistral
Vamos a chocar Â¿mediyak? Medi aaaaaaah


I'll build a base that's so damn fine
It'll get featured on grand designs


What's that Mom, dinner's ready?
Gotta run guys
