On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand
In the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street
Heads turning all day
When they see you with me

I'm thinking everybody
Better stand in line
'Cause they don't know that your body
Is coming with me tonight

They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up, whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it, baby
You look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Baby, you look good

Black dress to the 9s
New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof
Make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me, girl
In your black-faded jeans
You ain't gotta work hard
When you're smilin' at me

Like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up, whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it, baby
You look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Singing, you look good
Baby, you look good

I'm thinking everybody
Better stand in line
'Cause they don't know that your body
Is coming with me tonight

They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up, whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it, baby
You look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Baby, you look good, yeah
Baby, you look good
