Hey now, what you gonna do
Are you gonna be mine tried and true
Hey hey hey now, give it to me straight?
Am I gonna be the one or just another date?
Look-a here, I gotta know quick
Because I can't waste my time just waitin' round your line
When I can find another guy

So hey hey hey now, what you gonna say?
Are you gonna go on or are you gonna stay?
Wo oh right here, oh I gotta go, dear
Because I can't waste my time just waitin' round your line
When I can find another guy, so...

Hey hey hey now, what you gonna say?
Are you gonna go on or are you gonna stay?
