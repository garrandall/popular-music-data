Well, everybody's heart needs a holiday, sometime
And everyone of us needs to get away, somehow
So I'm laughing lighthearted moods, oh, the sight-seeing afternoons
And tellin' a joke or two 'cause everyday invites you
To find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
(Find your place, find your place in the sun)
It's time to find your place in the sun

Everybody's pannin' for gold, and you can find it for a price
Love always promises to last forever, but sometimes it just don't work out
'Cause laughing lighthearted tunes, oh, sometimes they turn to blues
So tell yourself a joke or two 'cause every day invites you
To find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
(Find your place, find your place in the sun)
It's time to find your place in the sun
(Come on now, come on now)
(Come on now, come on now)
It's time to find your place in the sun

Those laughing lighthearted tunes, oh, sight-seeing afternoons
And tellin' a joke or two 'cause everyday invites you to find your place
'Cause everyday invites you to find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
(Yeah)
It's time to find your place in the sun
(Find your place, find your place in the sun)

It's time to find your place in the sun
(Come on now, come on now)
(Come on now, come on now)
It's time to find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
(Come on now, come on now)
(Come on now, come on now)
It's time to find your place in the sun
(You better find your place, you better find your place)
