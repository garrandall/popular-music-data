Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Aah!


Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why


When we get crazy
It just ain't right
(Try to keep you head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you


Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why


Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
