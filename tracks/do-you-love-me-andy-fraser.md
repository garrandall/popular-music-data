(Do you love me)
I can really move
(Do you love me)
Said I'm in the groove
(Do you love me)
Do you really love me now
Now that I, I can dance

Watch me now

(Work, work)
Gonna work it out, baby
(Work, work)
Drive me crazy
(Work, work)
With a little bit of soul, child

From rocking and rolling
(Rocking, rolling)
Doing the slam (do the slam)
Tell me, baby (tell me, baby)
Do you like it like that
(Like it like that)

Come on, tell me (yeah)
Tell me (yeah) tell me (yeah)

(Do you love me)
I can really move
(Do you love me)
Well, I'm in the groove
(Do you love me)
Do you really love me now
Now that I, I can dance

Hit me now

(Work, work)
Come on and wind me up, baby
(Work, work)
I'll drive you crazy
(Work, work)
I'll bet you're getting
Kind of cold now

From rocking and rolling
(Rocking, rolling)
Do the slam (do the slam)
Tell me, baby, now (tell me, baby)
Do you like it like that
(Like it like that)

Come on, tell me (yeah)
Tell me (yeah) tell me (yeah)

(Do you love me)
I can really move
(Do you love me)
Said I'm in the groove
(Do you love me)
Do you really love me now
Now that I, I can dance
Dance, dance, oh, yeah

Watch me now
Whoa, yeah

All night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Watch me now

(Do you love me)
I can really move
(Do you love me)
I said I'm in the groove, yeah
(Do you love me)
Child, do you love me
(Do you love me)

(Do you love me)
Hey, baby, now, do you love me
(Do you love me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Do you love me)
Do you really love me now
Now that I, I can dance
