You're shiftless and you're lazy
Just like that hound dog, Daisy
I had when grandma raised me
Honey Chile


When Granny got too old to scorn me
Dear old Auntie warned me
You sure was no good for me
Honey Chile


But your kiss is sweeter than the cake
That Grandma used to bake
All them sweet little things about you
Sure enough takes the cake
You ain't gonna amount to nothing
'Cause you ain't gonna work for nothing
Without you, I'm good for nothing
Honey Chile


Honey Chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so, can't let go
Now, Honey Chile
Oh, Sugar Chile
I'd walk me a country mile
Just to be with you
It's sad but true, now Honey Chile


I try to act like a lady
But you've been courtin' Sadie
Your reputation's shady
Honey Chile


Hey, you even took out Sally
Who lives across the alley
Oh, I've been keeping tally
Honey Chile


You're like the grapes up on the vine
That went in granny's wine
'Cause like that homemade wine, so sweet
You sure enough drive me out of my mind now
You ain't nothing but a playboy
Using me for a play toy
You're ruining my pride and joy, now
Honey Chile


Honey Chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so, can't let go
Now honey Chile
Oh, sugar Chile
I'd walk me a country mile
Just to be with you
It's sad but true, now Honey Chile


Oh, listen here now
One day I'm gonna get stronger
And I won't need you no longer
This feeling will be a goner
Honey Chile


Hey, now I can't take disgracin'
That ain't the way Granny raised me
You've gone and hurt me crazy
Honey Chile


Sugar Chile
I'd walk me a country mile
Just to be with you
It's sad but true now, Honey Chile
Hey, honey Chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so, can't let go
Now Honey Chile
Hey, Sugar Chile
