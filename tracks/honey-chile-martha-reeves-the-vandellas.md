You're shiftless and you're crazy
Just like the hound-dog Daisy
That grandma had when I was young

And when she told me, darling
You're not good for me honey
I fell down on my knees sweet honey chile

Honey chile
You're 'bout to drive me wild
Can't live without you, can't do without you
Honey chile

Honey chile
You're 'bout to drive me wild
Can't do without you
Sweet, sweet honey chile

To think I needed someone
It turned out to be you
And I so glad, sweet honey chile

'Cause they all told me about you
Said I got to leave you lonely
But I can't do that to you, honey chile

Honey chile
You're 'bout to drive me wild
Can't live without you, can't do without you
Honey chile
