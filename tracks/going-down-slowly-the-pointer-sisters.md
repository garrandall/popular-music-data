Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Don't get in too deep, brother
Don't get in too heavy
Don't fix, so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, John see
But he sees just a little too late
Losing his freedom and losing his soul
Now all he can do is just wait for the others

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down, yeah

Don't you get in too deep, sister
Don't get in too heavy
Don't you fix it so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, Mary see
Bu you see just a little too late
Had her history rectified
Now, all she can do is just wait for it to happen

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Don't get in too deep, brother
Don't get in too heavy
Don't fix, so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, John see
But he sees just a little too late
Losing his freedom and losing his soul
Now, all he can do is just wait for the others

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
(Slowly going down)
Holy moly slowly going down

(Slowly going down)
Going down slowly
Slowly going down
