Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it
If I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looks so satisfied
I can't help it
If I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past
Came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm
And walked so close to you

Then suddenly I got
That old time feeling
I can't help it
If I'm still in love with you

Oh, heaven only knows
How much I miss you
I can't help it
If I'm still in love with you
