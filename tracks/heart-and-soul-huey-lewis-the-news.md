Two o'clock this morning (morning)
If she should come a-calling (calling)
I couldn't dream of turning her away

And if it got hot and hectic (hectic)
I know she'd be electric (electric)
I'd let her take her chances with me
You see, she gets what she wants

Cause she's heart and soul
She's hot and cold
She's got it all, hot loving every night
Woah
Woah

Well, can't you see her standing there (standing there)
See how she looks, see how she cares (how she cares)
I let her steal the night away from me

Nine o'clock this morning (this morning)
She left without a warning (warning)
I let her take advantage of me
You see, she got what she wanted

Cause she's heart and soul
She's hot and cold
She's got it all, hot loving every night
Woah
Woah

(Heart and soul)
Yeah she's heart and soul
She's hot and cold
She's got it all
She's heart and soul

She's got loving every night
Woah
Woah
She's got it all
She's heart and soul

She's heart and soul
She's heart and soul
She's heart and soul
She's heart and soul
She's heart and soul
