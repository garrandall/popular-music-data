Get out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man

I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul
You're wearin' those dresses, your hair done up so nice
You're wearin' those dresses, your hair done up so nice
You look so warm, but your heart is cold as ice

I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul

I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood store
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood store
I can look at you and tell you don't love me no more

I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
The more I work, the faster my money goes

I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul
Shake, rattle and roll!
