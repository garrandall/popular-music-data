Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on

You're way up on top now
Baby, since you left me, yeah
And you're always laughing
Down at me, yeah

But watch out, baby
I'm gonna get there
Yes, I am, and
We'll be together
For just a little while

And we'll start
Gathering tears
Way up here, ha ha
And you'll start crying
Ninety-six tears, hey

Cry, cry, cry, hey
Ha ha ha, yeah

Hey, I'll be on top
And you'll be there
Just looking up, yeah
I had a way to get up here

Yes, I did
And I don't see you
Waving down
I'm gonna get you
Yes, I am, ha, ha
Cry, cry, cry

Too many teardrops for
One heart to be crying, yeah
Too many teardrops for
One little heart to carry on

Yeah, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears, yeah, yeah
Cry, cry, cry all night long
In the midnight hour
