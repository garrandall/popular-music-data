Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And it's like you haven't been
Gone a moment from my sight
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time were holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die, your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends, if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe
Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever in the heart of me
I would hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most

See that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe
Oh, I believe

There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And I believe
