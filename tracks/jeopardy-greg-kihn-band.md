Where were you
When we needed you
Well you could not be found
What can I do
Oh, I believed in you
You're running me around

Well you can take it as a warning
Or take it anyway you like
It's the lightning, not the thunder
You never know where it's gonna strike

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh

Don't be cute
Don't be funny now
It's later than you think
Oh, what's the use
Save your money now
It's hanging on the brink

Don't let go while I'm hanging on
'Cause I been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone
I know you're not that strong
Yeah, yeah

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh



Don't let go while I'm hanging on
'Cause I've been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone
I know you're not that strong
Yeah, yeah

Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby
Oh-oh-oh
Our love's in jeopardy (jeopardy), baby
Oh-oh-oh
Our love's in jeopardy (jeopardy), baby
Oh-oh-oh
Love's in jeopardy, baby
