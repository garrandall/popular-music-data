Seems so strange
You're putting me through changes

Baby, I can't believe that you're the same
Sweet girl, that I once knew
Baby, the change has come about
And it don't look too good on you

It seems so strange
You're putting me through changes
Baby, you've started doin'
Things you should not be doin'

Livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
You're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong

Baby, don't think that I don't know
You're runnin' out with other guys
Baby, though it hurts me so
You know that I'm still hypnotized

Don't let my pride
Kill all the love inside of me
Baby, you've started doin'
Things you should not be doin'

Well, livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
Yeah, you're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong

Livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
You're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong

With our love, with our love

Livin' above your head...
