Come back baby, I love you
Come back baby, I need you
Come back baby, I love you

Ooh baby, I love you
Ooh-ooh
Ooh baby, I love you
Ooh-ooh

Although I know you are gone
Memories still linger on
From your love I'll never be free
I love you, baby
You'll always be a part of me
I need you, ooh

These memories
Just won't give me time, I love you
There's always
Something here to remind me

Ooh baby, I love you
Ooh-ooh
Ooh baby, I love you
Ooh-ooh

Everyday, I just walk alone
'Cause without you I just can't go on
The months have come
The months have gone, I love you, baby

But I still wait for you
To come back home
I need you, baby

Every night I wake up crying
I love you, baby
But baby, there's no need denying

Ooh baby, I love you
Ooh-ooh
Ooh baby, I love you
Come back baby, I love you
Come back baby, I need you

Can't you hear me calling you, yeah
Come back baby, I love you
