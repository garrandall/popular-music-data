Number one
(Number one)
Was just a small town hick

Number two
(Number two)
Was my best friend named Dick

Number three
(Number three)
She called him Doc, that's me

Hickory, Dick and Doc she called us
We chased her around the clock
Night and day, Hickory, Dick and Doc
Thought she loved us until we heard her say

They're just like three blind mice
Three blind mice, see how they run after me
Hickory, Dick and Doc around the clock
See how they run after me

Number one
(Number one)
Well, I never cared much for him

Number two
(Number two)
Well, he's no longer my best friend

Number three
(Number three)
I've gotta keep her love from them

Hickory, Dick and Doc she called us
We chased her around the clock
Night and day, Hickory, Dick and Doc
Thought she loved us until we heard her say

They're just like three blind mice
Three blind mice, see how they run after me
Hickory, Dick and Doc around the clock
See how they run after me

Three blind mice, three blind mice
See how they run, see how they run
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
