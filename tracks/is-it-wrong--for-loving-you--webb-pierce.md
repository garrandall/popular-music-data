Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true
Tell me darling tell me please dear is it wrong
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you

Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart
Yes the only true love I ever knew
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you
Is it wrong for loving you...
So is it wrong is it wrong for loving you
