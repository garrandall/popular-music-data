People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
They don't realize

Is when you're dialing 6 numbers just to hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say its gonna be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helping me at all

Cause when you're talking out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you ever drank
Sinking down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees
Praying to God, begging Him "please"
that's when she's more than a memory

She's more
She's more

Cause when you're dialing her number just hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
