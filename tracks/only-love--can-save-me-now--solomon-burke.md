I'm only loaning out my lips
Loaning out my arms
Giving it all I've got
Doing myself harm

Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Only love, only love, only love
Only love can save me now

I'm always loaning out my time
All my nights and days
Running from pillar to post
But I find it never pays

Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Only love, only love, only love
Only love can save me now

There's got to be someone for me
Somewhere under the sun
You share true love
A real, real true love
That's no sad said and done

Well, I'll stop loaning up my lips
Drips that don't respond
Loaning out my love
To lovers that move on

Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Only love, only love, only love
Only love can save me now

(Only love can save me now)
Oh, somebody
(Only love can save me now)
I need, need somebody
(Only love, only love
Only love, only love)
To save me now, yes, sir
