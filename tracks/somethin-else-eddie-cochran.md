A look a-there, here she comes
There comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with all the guys from outa my class
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else

Hey, look a-there, across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is outa my class
But that can't stop me from athinkin' to myself
That car's fine lookin' man, it's something else

Hey, look ahere, just wait and see
Worked hard and saved my dough
I'll buy that car that I been wanting so
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
We'll look real sharp with the flight top down
I keep right on a-dreamin' and a-thinkin' to myself
When it all comes true man, wow, that's something else

Look a-there, what's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knockin' on her door
My car's out front and it's all mine
Just a forty-one ford, not a fifty-nine
I got that girl an' I'm a-thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else
