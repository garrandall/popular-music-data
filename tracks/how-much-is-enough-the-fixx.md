How much is enough?

Good enough's not good enough
Don't complain that you've got it tough
With all you have your life's a bore
Can't relax you want so much more
Blind needs won't set you free
Can't you see that
Time is slipping away?
But I got to say


How much is enough when your soul is empty?
How much is enough in the land of plenty?
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing
How much is enough, is enough?

Gravity may bring you down (down) (down)
But harmony could spin you 'round (around)
Information ariel says buy, buy, buy material
Give take all day long
Can't you see it's
Hopeless being strong
When you've got live it wrong?



How much is enough?
Buy, buy, buy
Buy, buy, buy

So give me your attention
I know it's getting late
While we were dreaming
Something slipped away
We're drowning in possessions
Playing tricks with our minds
Lost from one another
Baby, put your hand in mine
Time is slipping away
But it's not too late



How much is enough?
How much is enough?
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing
How much is enough, is enough?
How much is enough, oh?
When you feel nothing at all
