Gimme that Dunkie Butt and them big ol' legs
I ain't too hard to beg
Ain't no shame in this game
I'm gonna break it down and beg like James
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Bend over and get buckwild
Lemme do that Dunkie Georgia style
Lift me up and bounce around
Now do the brown
Rock it, pop it, don't stop it
I wanna knock it, yeah
Open up and lemme come inside
Take me on that donkey ride
I wanna make that body jerk
No time to play, just doing the work
'Cuz I'm a businessman takin' care of business
Can I get a witness?
So come on out you little devil
Lemme take it to another level
C'mon get sick like Bushwick
'Cuz I need a Dunkie quick
So lemme ride the donkey all the way down
I got you makin' the freaky style
'Cuz I'm just a freak then I'm up and ridin'
I don't need a long relationship
Just hit it, quit it, and dip

Gimme that Dunkie Butt and them big ol' legs
I ain't to hard to beg
Ain't no shame in this game
I'm gonna break it down and beg like James
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

I've been watching you on the floor
The way you move, you make me want you more
I like the way you strut, shakin' that big ol' Dunkie Butt
I'd do anything for it, what
'Cuz I'm about to heal and steal a feel
That big ol' butt makes a preacher want to kill, for real tho
'Cuz you go girl, I wanna rock your world, get down the curves
That girl's got me crazy, the way you're kickin' them Daisy's
I wanna lay you, love
Long, hard and lazy, please

I'm freaking 'em down ever since
I'm about the size of Prince
See I know how to satisfy you
Gimme that love that money can't buy you
Damn, I wanna try it, so gimme that funky chunky Dunkie
Wind it, grind it, I don't mind it
Thugs, I ain't lose it, I'm gonna find it
Back that butt up and make it beat
I'm gonna rock that Dunkie to sleep
Gimme that Dunkie Butt and them big ol' legs
I ain't too hard to beg
Ain't no shame in this game
I'm gonna break it down and beg like James
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Ride that Dunkie like crazy
Break it down and wind it real late
The way you to freak amazing, so smile like you're havin' fun
Now show the freak how it supposed to be done
Work it up and down and side to side
Take me on that donkey ride
Lemme show you how to get buckwild
And do that Dunkie Georgia style
I'm humpin' it, while you're pumpin' it
I got you on the run
I'm doin' you real good, freak
Like it's supposed to be done
Put a smile on your face, yeah
Like you're havin' fun
'Cuz 12 Gauge is a loaded gun
Ain't talkin' 'bout nothin, hun
So shake it 'til you break it
Don't fake it
Show me how long, freak, you can take it
Gimme that Dunkie Butt and them big ol' legs
I ain't too hard to beg
Ain't no shame in this game
I'm gonna break it down and beg like James
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...

Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Let me ride that donkey donkey
Lemme rock that Dunkie Dunkie
Please... (Hey-hey!) Please... (Hey-hey!) Please...
