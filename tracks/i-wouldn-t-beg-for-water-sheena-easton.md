I make friends, I make enemies, it doesn't matter all that much to me
I'm not the kind who deals behind the scenes
I won't sell my soul, I'd be nothing without some integrity

Chorus:
I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
If my soul was on fire, that's the last thing I would ever do
I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
If my soul was on fire, but I'd get down on my knees for you

I've got pride, it's not the foolish kind
Don't owe people favours, that's my peace of mind
I don't know why I deserve someone like you
But you're my one and only sole exception to all my rules


Real love is hard to find, as holding back the sands of time
And time can change my life as much as you

I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
If my soul was on fire, you know me well enough to know it's true
I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
(If my soul was on fire), but I'd get down on my knees for you
