You're the landlord and the keeper of our love
You're the landlord and the keeper of our love

Here was a heart torn apart
Desperately in need of fixing
I never found a heart big enough
Let alone someone in whom I could trust

All of you, opened up to let me see
In your heart there was fool  me

You're the landlord and the keeper of our love
You're the landlord and the keeper of our love

Well, well, well, well
I had no place to go, left to wander aimlessly
Often I was asked to spend the night
Ooh, but my heart wouldn't let me, it didn't feel right

I don't know how or where you found the key
Ooh, but you unlocked every door inside of me

You're the landlord and the keeper of our love
You're the landlord and the keeper

Who'll come to see me when I just pick up the phone
Who'll rush right over when I need to cut the heat on
And when my tears are flowing down the drain
I don't need no plumber 'cause he can unstop the pain

He's found the treasure and all my security
Everybody on the block knows
That I'm proud he found the key

Oh, you're the landlord and the keeper of our love
Our love, you know, everybody knows it
Oh, you're the landlord and the keeper of our love
You got that key to unlock that door in me
You're the landlord and the keeper of our love
Our love, our sweet, sweet love

You're the landlord and the keeper
You're the landlord and the keeper
You're the landlord and the keeper
You're the landlord and the keeper
...
