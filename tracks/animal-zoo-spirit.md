Living in the city, I've been abused (he has)
The jobs I keep, the people I meet
Don't do more than make me amused
Everywhere I turn now, just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find me a way to the animal zoo


Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on back to the animal zoo
Hey hey


Looking at my body, I'm slipping down (so far)
The air I breathe and the water I drink
Is selling me short and turning me around
Everyone I see now on their way too (everybody)
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find our way home to the animal zoo


Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey hey

Look out


Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey Hey ow


Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo

Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long...
