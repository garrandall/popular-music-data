Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they every found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up anyway
I got friends in this town

Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
âCause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out that you don't lie too well

Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out that I've been lying, too

Now I'm the white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of my tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar
