Never been too much for watching
Because there's too many things to view
And when eyes begin to wander
They more than likely never get through
But beyond my own temptation
I'm enticed by what I see
And I won't feel satisfaction
Until she's where I want her to be


I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, okay
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality


Never been too much for talking
Because there's too many things to say
And by the time that I start speaking
The right moment has slipped away
But I must break this old tradition
And try to muster up the words
And though someone else may have said them
I'll say them in way you've never heard


I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, alright
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me, yeah
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality, yes


Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby baby


Never been too much for touching
Because there's too many things to feel
Plus there's too much disappointment
When you find out those feelings ain't real
But here's a time when inner senses
Are gonna have to shine the light
Because I have overly committed
Myself in thinking that you're alright, that's why


I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
I got to make you my reality, please baby
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I gotta have you for me, yeah
You are a sight for sore eyes to see
Come on girl, make you my reality, yes


Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be Steve's reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby, yeah
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be reality, baby
Gotta be
