All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law


I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me


I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go, and let love begin


I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me


Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Think about me
Every, every once in a while
Think about me
