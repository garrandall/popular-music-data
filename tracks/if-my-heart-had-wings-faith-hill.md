Damn these old wheels
Rolling too slow
I stare down this white line
With so far to go
Headlights keep coming
Loneliness humming along
Who poured this rain
Who made these clouds
I stare through this windshield
Thinking out loud
Time keeps on crawling
Love keeps on calling me home
I'd jump all these mountains and take to the skies
Sail through the heavens with stars in my eyes

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

We both committed
We both agreed
You do what you have to to get what you need
Feeling you near me with so many miles in between
Lord, it ain't easy out here in the dark
To keep us together so far apart

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

Stuck on this circle
Spinning around
Cut loose from this rope
That's tying me down

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my
If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings
