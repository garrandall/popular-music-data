You take the midnight subway train
You're callin' all the shots
You're struck by lightning
You're in love

You take the evening one on one
You're only livin' to have fun
You want to use me, take me home tonight
I'll make you wish that you were mine

You're struck by lightning
You're in love

It's not worth fighting
You're in love

Well turn around
Remember me
I'm the one
Who's out and aimed to please

You're in love
You're in love

You make your livin' lovin' hot
You spin me like a top
You take the evening one on one (On one)
You're only livin' to have fun

You're struck by lightning
You're in love

It's not worth fighting
You're in love

Well turn around
Remember me
I'm the one
Who's out and aimed to please

You're in love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're in love

Well turn around (Turn around)
Remember me (Remember me)
Well turn around (Turn around)
I'm the one
Who's out and aimed to please

You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
(You take the midnight subway train)
You're in love
(You're callin' all the shots)
You're in love
(You take the evening one on one)
You're in love
(You're only livin' to have fun)
You're in love
(It's not worth fighting)
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
