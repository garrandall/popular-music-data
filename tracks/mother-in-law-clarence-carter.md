The worst person I know
Mother-in-law
Now she worries me so
Mother-in-law

If she would leave us alone
We'd have a happy home
Sent from down below
Mother-in-law, ha ha ha
Mother-in-law, ha ha

Satan should be her name
Mother-in-law (she's a mother)
(A mother-in-law)

To me they're about the same
(She's a mother, a mother-in-law)

Everytime I open my mouth
She tries to put me out
Sent from down below
Mother-in-law

(Mother-in-law) ha ha
(My mother-in-law)
Mother-in-law
(Mother-in-law)
(My mother-in-law)

Mother-in-law
(She's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)
Mother-in-law
(She's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)

I come home with my pay
Mother-in-law (she's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)

She asked me what I made
Mother-in-law (she's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)

She thinks her advice
Is the Constitution
But if she would leave
That should be the solution

And never come back no more
Mother-in-law (mother-in-law)
Ha ha ha (my mother-in-law)

Mother-in-law
(Mother-in-law)
(My mother-in-law)
Mother-in-law
(She's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)

Mother-in-law
(Mother-in-law)
(My mother-in-law)
Mother-in-law
(She's a mother)
(My mother-in-law)...
