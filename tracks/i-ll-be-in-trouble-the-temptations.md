If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble
If you decide to be untrue, I'll be in trouble
'Cause no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in trouble


If you decide one day you want to make a change, love
You want to leave me here and love a total stranger
Well, no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in danger


I'll do everything I can to make you stay
Keep you by my side (By my side)
'Cause I love you in such a way
I have to forget all about my pride


If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble
Oh yeah


If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble


I'll be in trouble, (So much trouble)
If you ever leave me, baby (I'll be in trouble)
If you deceive me (So much trouble)
I must confess, (I'll be in trouble)
My life would be a mess (So much trouble)
I'll be in trouble, baby (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble (So much trouble)
Hmmm, everyday, trouble (I'll be in trouble)
And everyway, so much trouble. (So much trouble)
Hmmm, baby (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble (So much trouble)
