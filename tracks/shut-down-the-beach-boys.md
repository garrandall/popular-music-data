Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down


It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Oooo rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standing side by side
(Oooo rev it up now)
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Oooo rev it up now)
Revving up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Oooo rev it up now)


Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down


Declining numbers at an even rate
(Oooo moving out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Oooo moving out now)
My Stingray is light the slicks are starting to spin
(Oooo moving out now)
But the four-thirteen's really digging in
(Oooo moving out now)
Got to be cool now, power shift - here we go


Superstock Dart is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really starting to go
To get the traction I'm riding the clutch
My pressure plate's burning that machine's too much


Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
(Oooo pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is starting to shrink
(Oooo pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Oooo pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sitting under my hood
(Oooo pump it up now)


Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
