How can I describe you
Couldn't if I tried to
Though it's clear to me
No one can see
The reasons why I love you
What a thrill to touch you
And you give so much, too
Every day I live
It's how you give
That is the beauty of you
There's more than the eye can see
You've got more that gets to me
Deep inside you lies
That wonderful surprise
Yes, there's more
Than the eye can see
So much more that gets to me
I don't know
What there is about you
But I know that I can't
Live without you
What a thrill to touch you
And you give so much, too
Every day I live
It's how you give
That is the beauty of you
There's more than the eye can see
You've got more that gets to me
Deep inside you lies
That wonderful surprise
Baby, baby, baby
More than the eye can see
So much more gets to me...
