I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'Cos you started somethin', oh, can't you see
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go and what you do
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
Oh look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy, but it's true, I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me, asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance

Now listen honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey, I don't care
'Cos you started somethin', oh can't you see
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you
I said I only want to be with you
