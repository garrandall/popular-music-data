Good God!
Three, four, huh!

In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Oh, won't you come with me
And a-take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And a-walk this land?
Please take my hand

Let me tell you now
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Oh, won't you come with me
And a-take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And a-walk this land?
Please take my hand

It's all right, huh!
All right now, huh!

Good God!
Three, four, huh!

In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Oh, won't you come with me
And a-take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And a-walk this land?
Please take my hand

Huh, huh
All right, uh, hey, ha!
