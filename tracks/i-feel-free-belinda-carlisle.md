Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
I feel free
I feel free

Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You - you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street but there's no one there
Though the pavement's one huge crowd
I can drive down the road but my eyes don't see
Thought my mind wants to cry out loud
Yea my mind wants to cry out loud

Ah
Ah
Ah

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

As far as I can see
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
I feel free
I feel free
