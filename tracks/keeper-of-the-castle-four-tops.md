Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
Oh, can't you see while you're pickin' on society
That the leaves on your family tree are callin' you to come home

You're the keeper of the castle, so be a father to your children
The provider of all their daily needs
Like a sovereign Lord protector be their destiny's director
And they'll do well to follow where you lead

Oh, in your head, you don't believe what the good book said
You're gonna strike out now instead, 'cause the world's been unkind
Put through thick and thin whatever shape your heart is in
You only have one next of kin better keep 'em in mind

You're the keeper of the castle, so be a good man to your lady
The creator of the sunshine in her day
Tend the garden that you seeded be a friend when a friend is needed
An' you won't have to look the other way

Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
Oh, can't you see, while you're pickin' on society
That the leaves on your family tree are beggin' you to come on home

Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
In your head, you don't believe what the good book said
