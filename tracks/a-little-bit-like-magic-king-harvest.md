I looked around my town this morning
I took a walk through my neighborhood
Well it, it came without a warning
Mmm, I just started feeling good

I went walking in the bright sunshine
It was bringing in a brand new day
The breeze was blowing so sweet and so fine
It was blowin' all my troubles away

Well it's a little bit like magic
You're as free as you want to be
It's a little bit like magic
Take a look around
I think you'll see

Well now my walks each day
Can take me out of the shadows
Leave behind a shade of grey

What happened yesterday
Well it really don't matter
What I'm trying to say
You can find a way
Get out on your way
Living the magic today

Well it's a little bit like magic
Take a look around
I think you'll see
Yeah it's a little bit like magic
You're just as free as you want to be

Yeah it's a little bit like magic
Take a look around
I think you'll see, yeah
Yeah it's a little bit like magic
You're as free as you want to be

It's a little bit like magic
It's just a little bit like magic
Mmm, a little bit like magic
It's a little bit like magic
