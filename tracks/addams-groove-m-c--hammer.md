They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family


Now I was cold coolin', you know (maxin' and relaxin')
Just kickin' it around the house (Oaktown kicking' it)
When a knock, a knock, a knock and a voice yo!
Can Hammer come out? (what's up?)
Now I don't mind (mind) being a friend
And showin' a little bit of flava (flava)
But Wednesday, Pugsley, Gomez, Fester (oh man)
Man, them some strange neighbours


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family


I remember the day I needed to borrow
A little of pepper (for my chicken)
The next thing you know, comin' at me
Was a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I ain't with that)
Now I tried to play it along (you know)
And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)
But what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (Cousin It)
Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family


Speakin' and thinkin' about the Addams
You know the Hammer is with it (I'm with it)
Act A Fool, No Bones, Swoop, Goofy, and Randy
You know we kick it (the posse)
Now is the time to get in your mind
It's ok to be yourself (be yourself)
Take foolish pride and put it aside
Like the Addams, yo! They def (that's a family!)


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

(Addams) Too legit (who's too legit?)

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, this is the Addams Groove right here, ha ha


(Addams) Yeah yeah
(Addams) Just like that
(Addams) Oh yeah
(The Addams Family) You know you gotta fully understand


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

I'm tellin' you I saw the hand
(The Addams Family) Thing, man, I saw


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family


It's the Addams
Yeah, thank you Fester
I needed to go back to the bridge again
Thank you, thank you, now check this out


They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family


Cousin It got in the flow
And he got to wibblin' and wobblin'
And he did this cool new turn move he had
Everybody backed up, you know what I'm saying
He backed them up


Addams (Too legit)
Addams (Too legit)
Addams (I'm talking about the Addams)
The Addams Family


You know what I'm saying
Now I'm talking about the Addams
Speaking and thinking about the Addams Family
They don't hurt anyone
They just like to have fun
