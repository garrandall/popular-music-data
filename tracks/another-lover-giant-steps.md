I'm back out on my boss shit
I bet niggas though that I lost it
I gone OTB now
Ounces to boxes
Still counting my losses
F'd out as that gossip
I thugged out with the wotsit
Jump out and you're dog shit
I was looking at life in the dog pit
Looking at life and I dodged it
I was looking at guys like I was shit
I was Giggs, but now I'm just a number
Now I'm out on my shit with my hunger
Light up the booth let me fill it up with Ganja
Watch them specials turning, let that special burn him
Hate, snakes, rats and vermins why all that petrol's burning
My success is hurting
My success is just killing breddas so much
My success is hurting
Get that cessy burning, get that sexy bird in
She's obsessed with flirting, so get that sexy word in
Phone number, get them texts working
Tell her cut the phone sex, I want that sex in person
Run up on bastards
Touch them bastards
So fuck them bastards
Got that Markarov
Man'll  on bastards
Wanna question Giggs?
I got the fucking answers
Fucking bastards, I've had enough of bastards
Stop begging, you've had your fucking chances

All you fence youts watching from the ringside
I got contacts, niggas on the inside
We're them cut work, wrap it up in cling guys
AMG sign sitting on the rim side
This is how we do it
Three bedroom house swag this is how we blew it
Eat up the rap game listen how we chew it
Let it digest, piss it out and poo it
Where the fuck's all my guerillas at
All you real niggas better 
Think your swagger man will slap off your Margiela hat
I see you stunting with that baller but you're still a swat
I tell her get your going out to dinner swag
Any chick you see with Hollowman she got the winner tag
If you see me standing in the club I got the ting and that
Stunting get laid in a pool of blood I make you swim in that
You little stuntman
I get that jump lead, jump man
We make that shit, make niggas wanna slump man
We got that big sound for your little jump and
Rolling blacked out, with the seat low
In the jungle, on the deep roll
Man'll hot pepper, Jalapeno
Show them how a gully fucking G roll
This is how we set it
Fuck niggas man this is how we get it
Life of the famous getting paralytic
The haters so sorry, so apologetic
Man fuck all them niggas that wanna challenger
Niggas that be rolling on niggas with 40. caliber
Fuck all them hating arse niggas thats only manista
Case got buss wide open shout to my barrister
I was sitting in prison watching the calender
Sweeping and bopping the landing like I'm a janitor
And I move jammy with niggas that wanna jam with a
Nigga that cabbages niggas cause I'm a cabbager

The prophecy, please get off of me
Old school like my steering's mahogany
(To Charlie) You know them oldschool whips?
The prophecy, please get off of me
Old school like my steering's mahogany
That's your niggas bitch he wants to offer me
That's the reason these pricks tryna copy me
If you're thinking the rap game is soft for me
2.5 of the 45 be costing me
I'm an OG nigga, no guy's the boss of me
Might catch me in the A Town with Flocka B
Strap game's a killer
Nigga make way for the rap game's gorilla
Chicks looking at me like "that bre's a winner"
I got top models up in the flat staying for dinner
Yeah I remember way back, smack day's were realer
Now I got footy fans that play for Villa
The darkest yoot will get slapped change vanilla
Might he more switch to the black range or bimmer

I'm back again
Raise your hat again
Standing ovation, time to clap again
Told a man's giant so time to flatten them
Just has a late night session, man 's driving back and then
Pigs turn left and then man's driving back on them
Mad paranoid don't want that light to flash again
And so the pigs turned off then my smile is back again
Music turned low, rise it back again
Where's that boom tune der? Find it back again
I ain't listening to that pile of crap again
They don't play man's shit, why is that again?
I send a complaint and they just file it back again
(Alright let me wrap it up now)
Keep your head above the water nigga
Get your money out to feed your little daughter nigga
And when you're in the trap with them junkies
Check the money cause you know they like to short a nigga
You gotta build your little fortune nigga
You're on your own, ain't nobody gonna support you nigga
The street life, look where it brought a nigga
Tryna teach niggas what the hustle done taught a nigga
I scream hell no
Cause it's a hell hole
Niggas think it's Seasame Street looking for Elmo
If you niggas stepping to me I let a shell go
Never knew that nigga before but knew his girl though
Never had nothing on Giggs put him in jail though
Still put him in a cell though
But he never rang the bell though
Yea the art of war and it's another stance
Nigga can home from jail and got another chance
Man these niggas laying around wrapped in their lover's arms
Slap on the jimmy and let the rubber dance
I ain't got time for that I'm in another class
Tryna be that million air swimming in bubble baths
They're asking bout When Will it Stop?
But that's the summer chart
