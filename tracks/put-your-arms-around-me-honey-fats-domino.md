Put your arms around me, honey
And hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me
My heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin'
Like a motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you

Hold me tight
All your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
Begins to float
Motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you

So put your arms around me, honey
And hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you
Any girl like you (Repeat to Fade)
