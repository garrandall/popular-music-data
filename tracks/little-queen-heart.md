You'd rather have wine than gin
And only the finest by your skin
Always running after time
Catching your fancy with rhymes
Shining on the front page again

Now you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen

Away from the sellers, the papers said
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head
But still you danced and you sang
All night the telephone rang
And music kept on playing from your pen

Now you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, oh

You better shine, you better shine, you know
You better shine, shine shine tonight, oh
(Raining) He knows your soul ain't free
(Raining) Oh, and he feels you, little queen, yeah

(Raining) Oh, I know
(Raining) I see you, I see you raining
(Raining) He knows you're raining
(Raining) Oh, yeah

Now you're slipping away with your gypsy band
And you're hot on your music and playing a winning hand
You were standing in the line
Thinking how you moved his mind
And feeling like he held you in his hand

And you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen

Magazine
Little queen, yeah
Oh oh, no, no, no, little queen
Oh, oh no, no, no, little queen
