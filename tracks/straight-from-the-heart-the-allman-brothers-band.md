You've heard every line before
My life's a revolving door
With no way out and no way in
You know just what's on my mind
Could you take a chance one more time
Maybe we could start all over again
Straight from the heart
Baby my love

Your eyes can't tell a lie
I can see what you're feeling inside
Don't give up before we start
'Cause this time love is
Straight from the heart

I know what they're telling you
I wish I could say that it's not true
Love is so hard to find
But I never took the time
I never let you in
Please let me try again
Straight from the heart

Your eyes can't tell a lie
I can see what you're feeling inside
Don't give up before we start
'Cause this time love is
Straight from the heart

I thought I knew about love
But I didn't know at all
Didn't take the time to see
Until I started to fall
Straight from the heart
