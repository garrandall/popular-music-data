Here I stand
All alone in my lonely world
All alone waiting for that girl
Yeah here I stand

Here I stand
All alone in my world of dreams
All alone with my memory
Yeah here I stand

I love you so
Oh don't you know
I love you so

You don't know
You don't know how much I care
You don't know the torch I bear
So here I stand

Here I stand
Underneath the stars above
Waiting for you to bring your love
Oh here I stand

I love you so
Oh don't you know
I love you so
I love you so
Oh don't you know
I love you so
