Ayy, Royce you did it right here
Ayy, we takin' over 2k18 on my mama, nigga

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)

Now I'm in the 'Rari switchin' lanes
Pull up to the strip and they all know my name
Now I got this bread and my VV chain swang
I was just broke, steady lookin' for some stains
And my little brother Midget, free my nigga out the cage
Sellin' drugs and I get it out, your bitch, I'm gettin' paid
And I'm in a Masi 'cause I crashed the fucking Range
And I took your bitch 'cause I'm better than your main

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)

Yeah, you know I'm in that brand new space coupe (Space coupe)
Hop up out the van like, "Nigga, what it do?"
I just fucked yo bitch and then I kick her out my room (What it do?)
And I'm in a fast car, nigga, vroom, vroom (Vroom vroom)
I be wearin' Louis fit down 'cause I flex hard
Posted wit' my niggas sippin' Wockhardt (Sipping Wockhardt)
And we don't give a fuck, we got a cold heart
Runnin' through the money, nigga, that part (That part)

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (Boom, boom)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up (Might act up)
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up (I'm strapped up)
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up (Stacked up)
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up (Beat her back up)
