Me plus you
I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you (One time)
I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you (One time)
I'ma tell you one time
One time, one time


When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top


Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right


And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)


Your love's so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side
Them troubles, them not trouble me
Many have called, but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty, I'll give it to you


Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right


And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)


Shawty right there
She's got everything I need
And I'ma tell her one time, one time, one time
Give you everything you need
Down to my last dime
She makes me happy
I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one for me, yeah


And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)


Me plus you
I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you
I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you
I'ma tell you one time
One time, one time
