Yeah, hold up, uh, Playlist Poison
I mean, is everybody winning? Really?
Say what you feel and mean what you mean


Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team
Usually known for ridin dirty but I'm always ridin clean
Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring
All-all-all I do is win, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen


Man all these boys my little sons, I know I left y'all in poor care
They said I was on my high horse but I guess that meant my Porsche chair (yeah)
Checkin into that top floor, how come we don't ever see y'all there? (huh?)
Y'all ain't checkin in nowhere, y'all stay logged on the poor square
Poor squares, I don't know where you got your pimp degree
I might be messin with her friend but I'll man up to it admittedly (uh)
You take these girls out to eat and they leave from you and visit me (uh)
Pimpin is something that I learned but don't use much like calligraphy
I'm visibly, the man, I heard you talkin about it and winning is what you say it is
But you ain't really winning homie, you really just good at sayin it (yeah)
And you ain't swimmin in women homie, these women be callin you desert dick (yeah)
As soon as they pull that winning on me, I'm a give them this verse then tell 'em quit
I never trick, last time I checked and check my checks, I was gettin plenty
Most people that got opinions, just talk 'cause they ain't gettin any
If you ain't lived it, then just forget it, 'cause it really ain't nothin that you could tell me
Your voice ain't even worth a penny and your convo ain't worth a meal at Denny's


Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team
Usually known for ridin dirty but I'm always ridin clean
Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring
All-all-all I do is win, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen
Charlie Sheen, Ch-Ch-Ch-Charlie Sheen
I ain't got no damn boss, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen
All-all-all I do is win, let me tell you what I mean
Cut the check and kiss the ring, make some way for Charlie Sheen


Say I'm on that Carlos Estevez, I'm winning ho
I'm swimming in women that love women, so I'm bi-winning ho
Before you put your judgment on pimpin and say he sinnin
Try wakin up on Egyptian linen with Egyptian women
I'm talkin the hottest goddesses, wake me up with massages
Some say I'm a narcissist, other say I'm misogynist
I, say I'm a rock star, let's take flight in my rocket ship
Young Casanova, passin over, you simps and haters
And you never been about real bread, you ain't a baker
And you don't get rich to have one bitch, I ain't a Quaker
I remain unbought, unbossed, a young Jose-a
I'm Sheenin like my daddy before me, 'cause I'm his son
I could make these execs pay what they weigh, I'm talkin tons
Then I take that bank to Vegas and blow it, I'm havin fun
So, why would I act like a peasant, when I'm a King?
They ask me what's this drug I'm doin, that Charlie Sheen




'Cause I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man
You might not like who I am but you know I don't give a damn
(I don't give a damn)
'Cause I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man (uh)
Tryin to put me in a jam but you know you my biggest fan
(You my biggest fan)
I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man (uh)
Know I'm 'bout my business, so just trust me and stick to the plan
(Come on)
They don't even understand, how we be poppin rubber bands
(Haha, winning)


They say that it ain't no "I" in team, I told 'em it ain't no "I" in Sheen
And I see way too many eyes (uh), watchin my nuts stop tryin to swing
Illest drug that y'all done seen, ho I'm clean as Irish Springs
They tell me they want that "Tiger Blood"
then I'm a bottle it up and supply the fiends (uh)
She said she a goddess, she gonna be my side chick
Right after she slide it open, I'm pokin like a Sidekick (uh)
Heard my former A&R tryin to get me words to rhyme with
I told him choke on these nuts and I don't know the Heimlich
