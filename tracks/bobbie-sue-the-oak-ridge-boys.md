I was still a boy when it happened to me
I started shaking uncontrollably
Doctor came and he shook his head
And Mama cried when the doctor said
Ah you can see the look on the poor boy's face
Well he's been took with a terminal case
Ain't a prayer no there ain't no hope
You can hear the beat on my stethoscope

Well it's rock and roll, rock and roll
Can't be stopped it's out of control
It's got his body now it's after his soul
Ain't no cure for the rock and roll

It wasn't very long until the dread disease
Spread through the very best families
Folks had heard 'bout the devil's curse
But they all agreed this was a whole lot worse
The tragedy of my neighborhood
Was my best friend Johnny B Good
And both our girl friends caught it too
Talking 'bout Elvira and B-Bobbie Sue

Walking the street with a friend of mine
Shuffling my feet just to keep in time
From out of nowhere came a guitar lick
Nothing fancy but it did the trick
I said I turned into a little dancing fool
I thank my friend for keeping his cool
He said give him room and he'll be just fine
He's been this way since 1959
