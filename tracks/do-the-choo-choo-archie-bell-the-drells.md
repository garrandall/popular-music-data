Hi, everybody, this is

And we got another dance

Hey, little girl
I wanna dance with you
But I don't wanna do the horse
Take my hand and I'll show you how
To do the dance that's really boss
Do the Choo Choo
Do the Choo Choo
Do the Choo Choo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

First you get in a big boss line
And hook up like a train on a track
When you hear me holler

Be no turning back

Pull in the station now
