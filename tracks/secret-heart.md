Verse 1
Behold I was brought forth in iniquity
And in sin did my mother conceive me
Behold you delight in the truth and the inward me
And you teach me, wisdom in the secret heart

Our sins not far but right in front of me
Against You and You alone God I am guilty
Wash me thoroughly cleanse me from iniquity
And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart

Chorus
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
Renew a right spirit within me, oh God
Cast me not away from Your presence
Take not Your Holy Spirit
Restore in me the joy of Your salvation
And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart

Verse 2
Send me the chief of sinners to proclaim
Come be forgiven of sin, the lamb of God was slain!
Open my lips and my mouth will declare your endless praise
And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart

Chorus
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
Renew a right spirit within me, oh God
Cast me not away from Your presence
Take not Your Holy Spirit
Restore in me the joy of Your salvation
And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart
Wisdom in the secret heart

Bridge (Psalm 145)
The Lord is gracious and slow to anger
Rich in love, He is good to all 4X

(Lord You are gracious You are slow to anger abounding in love You are) 2X

Chorus
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
Renew a right spirit within me, oh God
Cast me not away from Your presence
Take not Your Holy Spirit
Restore in me the joy of Your salvation
And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart
