When I met you woman
I couldn't help but notice a face so beautiful
Now imagine, the faces you would make if we ever made love
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Pulled up in the drop top Benz
Hit the horn two times and you walked outside
Dress keep hugging them thighs and the only thing inside my mind is
I want you, yes I do, and if there's anything you suggest I do, then tell me
Now we all in the crib on my sofa
Girl, I'm so glad you came over
I wanna tell you, "Come closer"
But I don't know if you feel, like I feel, tell me, girl


Don't it feel good when I touch on it?
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you?
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be


Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in


Girl, let me wrap my hands around you
So happy ever since I found you
Just like a kid who found some candy, let me feel and find your panties
Take 'em off, take em off, take 'em off take 'em off please
Oh down on my knees
Oh, you're right in front of me
Don't have to pay for my attention, can you hear me? Is you listening?
Baby, be real with me, I wanna know


Don't it feel good when I touch on it?
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you?
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be


Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in


The way you bite your lip is that your way of telling me you like it? Mmhmm
If I'm the best you ever had girl, in your life, say mmhmm
And when your eyes roll back in your head, the shaking in your legs
Mmhmm, mmhmm, that's what she said


Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces, let the people sing
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in, love faces
