When I'm feelin' lonely
Someone telephone me
It's gettin' hard to pass my time

Take me out'a dinin'
Watch me while I'm smiling
Baby, it's a waste of time

I need a man, perhaps a man like you
I need a man, to make my dreams come true

Say that you will find him
Creeping up behind him
Rulin' round' the town all day

Well, I'm underestimated
Hardly underrated
Can't there be another way?

I need a man, perhaps a man like you
I need a man, to make my dreams and I need a man

And then I won't be feelin' lonely
Knowing I'm the only one

He'll understand
All that I'm feelin' deep inside me
Knowing that at last he's come

Oh well, Oh well
Well,gettin' tired of lookin'
Wastin' all my cookin
Ending in a dreadful rile

Can somebody tell me
Say to me, or spell me
Why I'm feelin' lonely, wow! ow

I need a man, perhaps a man like you
I need a man to make my dreams
And I need a man

And then at night I won't be lonely
Knowing I'm the only one

He'll understand
All, that I'm feelin' deep inside me
Knowing that at last he's come

Maybe that I'm dreaming
Can't say they I've seen him
Somehow, I've just got to find

Someone understanding
Long enough to hand him
All that I've built up inside, the man!

I need a man like you, to make my dreams come true
Perhaps that man is you!
