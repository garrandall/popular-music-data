I see you standing over there
You look around without a care
I pretend you notice me
I look in your eyes
And what ya see...


Is made up in my mind
Am I just wasting time?
I think this could be love
I'm serious


What if we were made for each other?
Born to become best friends and lovers
I wanna stay right here in this moment with you
Over and over and over again
What if this could be a real love?
A love, a love, yeah


I write our names down in the sand
Picturing all our plans
I close my eyes and I can see
You, and you ask, will you marry me?


Is made up in my mind
Am I just wasting time?
I think this could be love
I'm serious


What if we were made for each other?
Born to become best friends and lovers
I wanna stay right here in this moment with you
Over and over and over again
What if this could be a real love?
A love, a love, yeah


I don't know what to think
Is this real or just a dream?
In my heart is where you'll be
I'll keep waiting 'til we meet


What if were made for each other?
Born to become best friends and lovers
I wanna stay right here in this moment with you
Over and over and over again
What if this could be a real love?
A love, a love, yeah


Boy, you know you really make my heart stop
Stop, stop


Oh, what if this real love
What if this real love?
Oh, what if this real love
What if this real love?
Oh, boy, you make my heart stop
You make my heart stop
You make my heart stop
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, boy, you make my heart stop
