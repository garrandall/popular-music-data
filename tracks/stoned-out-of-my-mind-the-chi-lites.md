Baby, when I found out you were lyin'
Playin' around and connivin'
Undesired tears I was cryin'
'Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin'

I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin' wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
'Cause nobody else could make me

You got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned) hey, hey (out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned) hey, hey (out of my mind)

When you led me to the water I drank it
Man, I drank more than I could hold
When you took my mind and body
You know you wanna take my soul

Where can I run
Where can I hide
Who can I talk to
Tell me what, what can I do

When you got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned) hey, hey (out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned) hey, hey (out of my mind)

Hee... you got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned) hey, hey (out of my mind)
Been around with every guy in town (stoned out of my mind)
Funny but I just can't put you down (stoned out of my mind)

You got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin' (stoned out of my mind)
