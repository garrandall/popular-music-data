I've cried through many endless nights
While holding my pillow tight
Then you came into my lonely days
With your tender and your sweet ways
Now I don't know where you come from, baby
Don't know where you've been, my baby
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Into my arms
Now in the mornin' when I awake
There's a smile on my face
You've touched my heart with gladness
Wiped away all my sadness
So long I've needed love right near me
A soft voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, baby
Into my life
It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
Wanna thank you for the joy you brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close
When I needed you the most
Now I don't know much about you, baby
But I can't live without you, baby
Heaven must have sent you, baby
To love only me
It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
Wanna thank you for the joy you brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close
When I needed you the most
It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
