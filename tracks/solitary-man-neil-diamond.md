Melinda was mine
'Til the time that I found her
Holding Jim, loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong
That's what I thought
Me and Sue, but that died too

Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man, solitary man

I've had it to here
Bein' where love's a small word
Part-time thing, paper ring
I know it's been done
Havin' one girl who'll love me
Right or wrong, weak or strong

Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man, solitary man

Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
