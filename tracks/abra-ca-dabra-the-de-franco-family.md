Don't you know I get a magical feeling
Every time you're near
And it always sets me rocking and reeling
When you disappear

You keep me wondering
Just how good it could be
Don't you know it feels like magic, baby
What you're doing to me


Abra-ca-dabra
Alacazam
Abra-ca-dabra
Look where I am
You've got me believing in things I didn't before
Abra-ca-dabra
Won't you show me some more?

Show me now
Show me now
Show me now
Now, now!


Don't you know you got a spell on me, baby
I don't know what to do
Half the time
I'm full of all kinds of crazy daydreams over you

No use explaining
What those feelings could be
Don't you know they feel like magic, baby
When you give 'em to me?
