Every time I turn the conversation to something deeper than the weather
I can feel you all but shuttin' down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now

What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear, we're at a crossroads here...


If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

With you I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowin' where you're goin' I start thinkin' that we're lookin'
 We're lookin' at goodbye

How about a strong shot of honesty, don't you owe that to me...


If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph, someone who used to make you laugh

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done, let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
Consider me gone
Consider me gone
Just consider me gone
