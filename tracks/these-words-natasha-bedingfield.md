My heart

These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?

Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machine

I know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Tryna find the magic
Tryna write a classic
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
Don't you know
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
From my heart flow
(They're from my heart.)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
(There's no better way.)
To better say
I love you, I love you!

These words are my own
They're from my heart
I love you, I love you!

That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you. Is that okay?
