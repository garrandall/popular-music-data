Uh, what's happenin', CC?
They still call it the White House, but that's a temporary condition too
Can you dig it, CC?
To each his reach and if I don't cop it ain't mine to have
But I'll be reachin' for you 'cause I love you, CC
Right on

There's a lot of chocolate cities around
We got Newark, we got Gary
Somebody told me we got LA
And we workin' on Atlanta

But you're the capital
Gainin' on ya

Get back
Gainin' on ya
Movin' in on ya
Gainin' on ya
Can't you feel my breath
Gainin' on ya
All up around your neck

Hey, CC, they say you jive and game and can't be changed
But on the positive side, you're my piece of the rock and I love you CC
Can you dig it?

Hey, uh, we didn't get our 40 acres and a mule
But we did get you, CC
Yeah
Gainin' on ya
Movin' in around ya
God bless CC and its vanilla suburbs

Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
Feel the funk
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
Feel the mother love
What's happenin', blood?
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya

Yeah
What's happening, black?
Brother black
Blood, even
Yeah
Just funnin' man

Gettin' down
Uh blood to blood
Uh playas to ladies
The last percentage count was 80
You don't need the bullet when you got the ballot
Are you up for the down stroke, CC?
Chocolate city
Are you with me out there

And when they come to march on ya
Tell 'em to make sure they got their James Brown pass
And don't be surprised if Ali is in the White House
Reverend Ike, Secretary of the Treasure
Richard Pryor, Minister of Education
Stevie Wonder, Secretary of Fine Arts
And Miss Aretha Franklin, First Lady
Are you out there, CC?
Chocolate City is no dream, it's my piece of the rock
And I dig you, CC
God bless Chocolate City and its Vanilla suburbs

Gainin' on ya
Can you all get to that
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
In your stuff
Gainin' on ya
Can't get enough
Gainin' on ya
Gainin' on ya
Feel the funk
Gainin' on ya
Yeah we funky too
Gainin' on ya
Right on, chocolate city

Yeah, get deep
Real deep
Heh
Get deep
Uh
Just got New York, I'm told
