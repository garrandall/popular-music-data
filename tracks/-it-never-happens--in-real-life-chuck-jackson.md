(It never happens)
(It never happens)
(In real life)

In the story book
The hero young and brave
Fights to win his girl
And vows to be her slave

But, it never happens
Never happens
Never happens
In real life

Cinderella lost her slipper
At the Queen's ball
But she found the Prince
So handsome, so tall

But, it never happens
Never happens
Never happens
In real life

Billy and Milly, go steady now
I saw Johnny take Mary to the prom
Yes I did
Maybe iâ€™m silly
But, I know somehow, someday
My Queen will come along

Hurry to my heart
And give your love to me
Change my lonely life
I will believe

It never happens
Never happens
It never happens
In real life

It never happens in real life
It never, It never happens in real life
No no, no no...
