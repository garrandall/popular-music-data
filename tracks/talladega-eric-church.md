It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.

Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.

To Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

Like a stone, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause, that's just the deal,
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,

Rockin' Randall, gettin' rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
'Til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

When the winds grow cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars, my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind

Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.
