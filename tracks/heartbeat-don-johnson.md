Breathing, beating, the only sound
You're falling, an earthquake shakes the ground
And just as you're stepping, you're slipping away
You're hiding inside of the pain
The particles shifting along with the stars
You don't even know where you are, are

It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat - Fucking around
It's just your fucked up heartbeat - Bringing you down
Now you're banged up, lovestruck - Covered in blood
It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat, beat, beat - Beatin' you up

You're red, we'll see how far you can get
Need an exit out
We all thought you had it so deep in the game
Inside you were wasting away
Everything's shattered and covered in glass
This heartache is kicking your ass

It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat - Fucking around
It's just your fucked up heartbeat - Bringing you down
Now you're banged up, lovestruck - Covered in blood
It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat, beat, beat - Beatin' you up

Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, beatin' you up
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, beatin' you up

Breathing, beating, the only sound
You're falling, an earthquake shakes the ground

It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat - Fucking around
It's just your fucked up heartbeat - Bringing you down
Now you're banged up, lovestruck - Covered in blood
It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat, beat, beat - Beatin' you up

It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat
Fucking around (it's fucking around)
It's just your fucked up heartbeat
Bringing you down (it's bringing you down)
Now you're banged up, lovestruck
Covered in blood (covered in blood)
It's just your heartbeat, heartbeat
Beat, beat, beatin' you up (it's beatin' you up)
