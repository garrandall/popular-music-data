Don't think 'I'm sorrys what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty...we're both guilty
Let's walk through that door

A second chance is what I'm talkin' about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby, till I can't take anymore...

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
Hold me baby, you know I've been hurtin'
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong, baby, show me no mercy tonight

Remember when we thought that bein' apart
Would be the best thing for both our hearts?
It's a prison out there when you're livin' alone, for sure
Now I know how much I really missed you
No more games, just wanna be with you
Just give me all your lovin' till you can't give any more...

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
Hold me baby, you know I've been hurtin
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby show me no mercy tonight

In the silence of the early hours
I look at you, and I feel the power
Don't need promises to make it right
Let's just follow what we're feelin' inside...

Hold me baby, you know I've been hurtin'
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby show me no mercy tonight

No mercy, show me no mercy tonight
Love me strong and show me no mercy tonight
