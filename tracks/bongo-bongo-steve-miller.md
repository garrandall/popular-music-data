She likes it, she likes it
My baby she likes it
My baby she likes to dance
She loves it, she loves it
My baby she loves it
My baby she loves to dance

Puttin' her rouge on
Slippin' her shoes on
My baby's gettin' ready to dance
It's so calculated and anticipated
When my baby gets ready to dance

I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
I said baby, baby
You were born to dance

Ba Ba Ba Bongo Bongo

Ba Ba Ba Bongo Bongo

She likes it, she likes it
By baby she likes it
My baby she likes to dance
She loves it, she loves it
My baby she loves it
My baby she loves to dance

Puttin' her rouge on
Slippin' her shoes on
My baby's gettin' ready to dance
It's so calculated and anticipated
When my baby gets ready to dance

Modern jazz and ballet
Movin' to the sound
Modern jazz and ballet
Watch her spin around
Watch her spin around

She likes it, she likes it
My baby she likes it
My baby she likes to dance
She loves it, she loves it
My baby she loves it
My baby she loves to dance

I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
I said baby, baby
You were born to dance

Watch her spin around

She likes it, she likes it
My baby she likes it
My baby she likes to dance
She loves it, she loves it
My baby she loves it
My baby she loves to dance

Puttin' her rouge on
Slippin' her shoes on
Baby's gettin' ready to dance
It's so calculated and anticipated
When my baby gets ready to dance, to dance, to dance
Yeah, modern jazz

Ba Ba Ba Bongo Bongo
