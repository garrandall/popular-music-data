In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart-shaped locket
Staring at a family, flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight

Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls, catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire

Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
And she's saying, and she's praying

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot-'em-up cowboys

Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the scorecard
And just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words like were little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Toy guns

Oh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang, bang
Make you wanna run...

Yeah, like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Toy guns

Oh, like little toy guns
