Georgia, my heart with love
Bring me the mystery
And all that goes with the joy
May it never go away

There is a quality
That hunts my soul to bleed
When there is precious love
It's the most important thing

Precious love
We are most guilty of
Precious love
Never go away, no, no

Precious love
Our love is such a thrill
Precious love
Precious love, precious love

I hope time stays on our side
And keeps the passion burning bright
'Cause nothing can compare to your tender kiss
A feeling I will surely miss

We can make it last
As long as we feel the need
Forever and ever I want you
To be by my side

Precious love
Precious love
Never go away, no, no

Precious love
Our love is such a thrill
Precious love
Precious love, precious love

Precious love
We are most guilty of
Precious love
Never go away, oh, no

Precious love
Our love is such a thrill
Precious love
Precious love, precious love

Precious love
We are most guilty of
Precious love
Never go away, oh, no

Precious love
Our love is such a thrill
Precious love
Precious love, precious love

Precious love
We are most guilty of
Never, never, never, never, never
Never, never go away

Precious love
Precious love
Precious love, precious love

Oh...
