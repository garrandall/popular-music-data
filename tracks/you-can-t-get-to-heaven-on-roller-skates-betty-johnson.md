Oh, you can't get to Heaven
(Oh, you can't get to Heaven)
On roller skates
(On roller skates)
You gotta work your way
(Gotta work your way)
To the pearly gates
(Those pearly gates)
Oh, you can't get to Heaven
On roller skates
Gotta work your way
To the pearly gates
And you gotta believe
If you wanna get in

Yes, you gotta believe
Believe, believe
Oh, you gotta believe
Believe, believe
Oh, you gotta believe
If you wanna get in
Oh, you can't get to Heaven
(Oh, you can't get to Heaven)
With powder and paint
(With powder and paint)
'Cause it makes you look
(Cause it makes you look)
Like what you ain't
(Like what you ain't)
Oh, you can't get to Heaven
With powder and paint
'Cause it makes you look
Like what you ain't
Oh, you gotta believe
If you wanna get in
