Oh baby baby
Have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom
Is she smokin' up outside

Oh baby baby
Does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'mma buy her
Do you know just what she likes

Tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so
I can't get her off of my brain
I just want to go
To the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home
Ha ha he he ha ha ho

Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club

I've seen her once or twice before she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way

Tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so
I can't get her off of my brain
I just want to go
To the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home
Ha ha he he ha ha ho

Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Say what you want about me
But can't you see what I see
Say what you want about me

So tell me if you see her
Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like
'Cause I've been waiting here forever
Let me know if she was going out tonight
Oh baby baby
If you seek Amy tonight
Oh baby baby
We'll do whatever you like
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby

Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me hate me
Say what you want about me

Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Say what you want about me
But can't you see what I see
Say what you want about me

All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
