Made myself a prisoner
I locked myself away
Can't remember the last time
I saw the light of day
Don't want to face life
Feel I've been betrayed
I want you tell me
Where our love went astray


So can't you wait one more minute
Why can't you wait one more day
Let's get it straight
Because it's a big mistake
We better think about it


I don't want to break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
Never ever want to break it up oh no
I only want to make it up tonight


You say you've thought about it
But you sound so cold
You make it look like our love
Can be bought or sold
You won't listen
You say it's way too late
That something is missing
And now you just can't wait

So don't say break it up, break it up
I want to hear you say we'll make it up, make it up
I don't want to break it up
Oh baby, why can't we make it up tonight?
Make it up tonight, make it up tonight


And I ask myself
What's wrong with me?
How could I be so blind?
I know she tried to give me everything
But I still couldn't see
Now as I watch our love slip away
I'm begging you, begging you, please
