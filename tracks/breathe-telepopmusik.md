I brought you something close to me
Left for something you see though your here
You haunt my dreams
There's nothing to do but believe
Just Believe
Just Breathe


Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe
Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe


I'm used to it by now
Another day, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe
Lying in my bed
Another day, staring at the ceiling
Just breathe, another day
Another day, just believe
Another day
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now


Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just believe, just breathe
Just believe


Another day, just believe
Another day
Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe
Another day (I do believe)
Another day (so hard to breathe)
Another day (not so hard to believe)
Another day, another day
