Who's been sleeping in my bed?
Who's been crying on my pillow?
Who's been tossing who's been turnin' all night?
Someone had a bad time, a real real sad time
Won't somebody tell me

Who's been sleeping in my bed?
Who's been cryin' on my pillow?
Looks like there was someone walking the floor
If I'm not mistaken, her heart was breaking

Wonder what went wrong
Not a thing looks right
And I don't know why
All I know is last night we quarrelled
And you said goodbye. I wish I knew just

Who's been sleeping in my bed?
Who's been crying' on my pillow?
Who else can it be? It has to be me
I'm the one who's weeping instead of sleeping
'Cause you're gone from me, not a thing looks right
Wish I knew just who's been sleeping in my bed
