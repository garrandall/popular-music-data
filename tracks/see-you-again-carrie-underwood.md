Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away

But I won't cry
'Cause I know I'll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me
'Til I see you again

I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you

In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

I will see you again
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me
'Til I see you again

Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong
And I hold on
'Cause I know

I will see you again
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me

I will see you again
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me
'Til I see you again

'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again

Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
