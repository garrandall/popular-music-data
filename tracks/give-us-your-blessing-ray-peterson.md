Jimmy and Sue were both very young
But they were as much in love
As two people could be.
And all they wanted was to be together
And share that love eternally

They went to their folks and told them
That someday soon they'd be wed.
Their folks just laughed and called them kids,
So Jimmy said:

Give us your blessing,
Please don't make us run away.
Give us your blessing,
Say you'll be there on our wedding day.

They wouldn't have laughed at Jimmy
If they could have seen through the door.
They'd have seen Sue in the car
While he begged them just once more.

Give us your blessing,
Please don't make us run away.
Give us your blessing,
Say you'll be there on our wedding day.

Well as they drove off they were crying
And nobody knows for sure
It that is why they didn't see
The sign that read detour.

The next day when they found them
Jimmy and Sue were dead.
And as their folks knelt beside them
They couldn't help but hear
The last words that Jimmy had said:

Give us your blessing,
Please don't make us run away.
Give us your blessing,
Say you'll be there on our wedding day.

Give us your blessing,
Please don't make us...
