I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

And I don't have heart's desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
(Anything, anything)
Darling, since I don't have you

I don't have happiness
And I guess I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery and it's been here since then

I don't have love to share
I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
(Anything, anything)
Baby, since I don't have you

And I don't have heart's desires
And I don't have happy hours
