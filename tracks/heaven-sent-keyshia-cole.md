This is the remix
Mario
Keyshia cole
World wide baby
Sent from heaven.
Sent from heaven.

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
Don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oooo no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love


I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)

There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)I wanna be
I'll be the one to comfort you baby
And you know id do whatever to please your every need,
I'll be right here to keep you warm,
You got no worry atall I'll protect you from the start,
You know I'll be right here always by your side, baby,
I'm here to love you always and let me tell you why

Why
I, cause heaven knows that your my angel,
Cause I, I, will never leave you baby,
Cause love won't let me walk away
And I can't help who I love
And I find myself giving it all away
Cause I know I'm in love
I wanna be


I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one (sent from heaven)


I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
