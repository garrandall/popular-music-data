Hey, is that your old lady over there, man?
No, man, that ain't none of my old lady

I used to think that you never would be nobody's fool
Let me tell you, baby, you're a (Jive turkey)
Give me it straight (Jive turkey)
Yeah baby, you're a (Jive turkey)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, yeah, yeah (Jive turkey)
Well, well, well, well

'Cause you could do the do
'Cause you could do the do
'Cause you could do the do
'Cause you could do the do, baby
I put my trust in you
Well, well, well, well

Say what? Say you're sorry?

Early in the morning, early in the morning
Go out and me find somebody new

Jive turkey, jive turkey

Jive turkey, jive turkey
Jive turkey, jive turkey
Jive turkey, jive turkey
