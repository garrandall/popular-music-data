Down in Doheny where the surfers all go
There's a big beach blondie, named Surfer Joe
He's got a green surfboard and a Woody to match
And when he's ridin' the freeway's
Man, is he hard to catch

Surfer Joe
Now, look at him go-o-o-o-o-o
Surfer, Surfer, Surfer Joe-o-o
Go man go-o-o
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, Surfer Joe

He went down to Huntington Beach one week
For the annual surfer's convention meet
Hangin' five and walkin' the nose
And when the meet was over
The trophy was Joe's

Surfer Joe
Now, look at him go-o-o-o-o-o
Surfer, Surfer, Surfer Joe-o-o
Go man go-o-o
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, Surfer Joe

Okay let's go!

Surfer Joe joined Uncle Sam's Marines today
They stationed him at Pendleton, not far away
They cut off his big blonde locks, I'm told
And when he went on maneuvers, Joe caught cold

Surfer Joe
Now, look at him go-o-o-o-o-o
Surfer, Surfer, Surfer Joe-o-o
Go man go-o-o
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, Surfer Joe

Ah, ah, oh - ah, ah, oh - ah, ah, oh
Poor Joe!
