Doraville, touch of country in the city
Doraville, it ain't much, but it's home

Friends of mine say I oughta move to New York
New York's fine, but it ain't Doraville
Every night, I make a living making music
And that's all right to folks in Doraville
Yeah, hey hey

Ooh, hot time in Dixie, hey
It's funky but it's pretty
Sweet Georgia

Yeah, hey hey
Ooh, hot time in Dixie, hey
Come on down and visit, you'll dig it

Red clay hills, rednecks drinking wine on Sunday
Behind their field getting down in Doraville

Doraville, touch of country in the city
Doraville, it ain't much, but it's home

It's all right
It's all right

Doraville
Doraville, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Doraville
Doraville
