She may be weary
Women do get weary 
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary

Try a little tenderness
You know she's waiting
Just anticipating things she may never possess
While she's without them,

Try a little tenderness
It's not just sentimental
She has her grief and care
And a word that's soft and gentle

Makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it
Women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness

It's all so easy 
Try a little tenderness

She may be weary
Women do get weary 
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary

Try a little tenderness
You know she's waiting
Just anticipating things she may never possess
While she's without them

Try a little tenderness
It's not just sentimental
She has her grief and care
And a word that's soft and gentle

Makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it
Women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness

It's all so easy 
Try a little tenderness
