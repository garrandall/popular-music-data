If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox
Oh, oh Saturday night would've been a sad and lonely night
For me
And if you weren't standin' there ruby lips and golden hair
Beside the jukebox
O'h, oh I'd have lost my chance to hold you while you danced
With me
Mm - mm

While the records turn (and turn) and turn (and turn)
We danced (we danced) and learned (and learned)
Our hearts (our hearts) had yearned (had yearned) for this
Neath the moon we walked (we walked) and walked (and walked) and talked (and talked)
Of love (of love) and then we kiss-----ed

Now with every sweet caress oh, my darling how I bless
That little jukebox
Oh, oh love songs that they sing wouldn't mean a single thing
Even though you're standing there ruby lips and golden hair
If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Now with every sweet caress oh, my darling how I bless
That little jukebox
Oh, oh love songs that they sing wouldn't mean a single thing
Even though you're standing there ruby lips and golden hair
If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-fade
