Meeting Mr. Right
The man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love
Or at least it seems

With brown cocoa skin
And curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me
That gentle loving stare

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew
The way I feel about you
I just can't describe it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it, no
Can't hide it

It seems so many times
You seemed to be the one
But all you ever wanted
Was to have a little fun
But now you've come along
And brightened up my world
It's the way I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you
Just can't be wrong
If you only knew
The way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, no no

Finally it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
