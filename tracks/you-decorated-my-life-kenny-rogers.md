All my life was a paper
Once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen
Changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right

Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see
All the changes in me
By the look on my face

And you decorated my life
Created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
And an unfinished song
There was no harmony
Life meant nothing to me
Until you came along

And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see
All the things life can be
Shining soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life
Created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
