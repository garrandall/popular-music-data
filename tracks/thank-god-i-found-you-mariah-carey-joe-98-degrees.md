Ahhhm
Mhhh


Oh yeah


I would give up everything
Before I'd seperate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life


Thank God I found you
(Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you
(I was lost)
My every wish and every dream
(Mmmmh)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with graditude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you


Mmmh
Oh yeah
Whoaaaaaa 
Oh yeah


I will give you everything (everything)
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do (oh no)
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
(I don't wanna try)
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be allright (be allright)
'Cause I need you in my life


Ooooh
Thank God I found you
(I'm thanking you)
I was lost without you
(So lost without you)
My every wish and every dream
(Every wish, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life (completed)
I'm overwhelmed with graditude (overwhelmed with graditude)
('Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you)
And I'm so thankful I found you


Oooooh
(See)
See I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back (looking back)
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way
(This way)


Thank God I found you
(Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you
(Lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream
(And every dream)
Somehow became reality
Oooooooh
When you brought the sunlight
(Brought the light)
Completed my whole life
(My whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with graditude
See baby I'm so thankful I found you
Oooooooh
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with graditude
(So overwhelmed)
My baby I'm so thankful I found
You
You
I'm overwhelmed with graditude
My baby I'm so thankful I found
(I found you)
You
