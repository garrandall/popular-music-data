There's a stormy vision
Stars before my eyes
I seem to have this fear of the dark
That only love defies
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight
When you snap your fingers and change my fate, baby
Love gets its way and honey I must obey
I'm under the spell
So tough to clear out my head
Comin' down from a night of passion
I blacked out the moment I felt
This could only be love
I'm under the spell
A physical reaction, the doctors all agree
Disillusion's all in my head
It's so real to me
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight
When you snap my fingers and change my fate, baby
You'll get your way - cause honey - I must obey

I'm under the spell
So tough to clear out my head
Comin' down from a night of passion
I blacked out the moment I felt
This could only be love
I'm under the spell
Starstruck - I stare into space
I see the flash - then I hear the thunder
So shocked - I'm merely a shell
It's stranger than love -
I'm under the spell

Fools fall in love under the moonlight
Count me as one - under the spell
