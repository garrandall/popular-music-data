I filled up my pockets with money
Big trophies I've hung on my wall
My mansion sits high on the hilltop
And the world is impressed by it all.

But to me always all this glory is worries
And I've not been successful enough
For while I was thrilling the whole wide world
I was losing your love.

I forgot to kiss you
And hold to your charms
Success seems like nothing
To these empty arms.

All this time I've been gaining a treasure
That I can even speak partly of
For while I was thrilling the whole wide world
I was losing your love.

Slowly losing your love...
