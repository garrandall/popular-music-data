(GUITAR & PIANO INTRO)

To take a look and walk away

Isn't a stand man

To speak the words that everyone's heard

Isn't the way man

Everybody knows

All things must come and go

But

You know like I know that

Everything's gonna be alright

People just come and go

They don't know what's right

Till they're gone

Your sun will rise and set today

Just don't you worry

And everything will come your way

Just don't you hurry

Take a little time

And find you some peace of mind

Then

You'll know like I know that

Everything's gonna be alright

People just come and go

They don't know what's right

Till they're gone

Nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah...
