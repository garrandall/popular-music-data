Here I am, baby
I'm back again

It ain't the Twine, baby
It's Philly Freeze time

Now when I say freeze, baby
I want you to stop

Oh wee

Come on, baby
Freeze

Aw, but you're looking good now
Oh wee

Hit it, baby
Aw, have mercy
Here we go now

Here we go now
Freeze

Do you like it, baby
Do you like it, baby

(I like it, I like it
I like it like that
I like it, I like it
I like it like that)

Come on, baby
Freeze

Aw, have mercy
Oh wee

Aw, but you're looking good now

(I like it, I like it
I like it like that
I like it, I like it
I like it like that)
