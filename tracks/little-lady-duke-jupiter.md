I found her readin' gas-pump instructions,
She had a cigarette burning, hangin' out of her hand.
She had a little red dress in her chopped down cadillac eldorado
She had a sign said just got married, threw it back in the trash


What's a little lady like you
Little lady like you
What's a little lady like you
Driving all that automobile

She said she was goin' down a road to a party
She opened the passenger door and asked me if I wanted to go
She gave me a wink before I could stop and think I was jumpin' in the seat beside her
She put the pedal to the metal brunin' rubber all over the road

 x2

Down the road turned out to be Southern California
We had a white knuckled ride all up and down the coast
We stopped for a drink and I began to think maybe she was a little crazy
She put the pedal to the metal brunin' rubber all over the road

 x4
