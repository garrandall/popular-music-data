Ta Da
Tryna make you disappear
Make you pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong
The sound I'm waiting for
Your taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door
Oh, won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible but leave the car here
The pink slips in my name so the Benz has got to stay
Why you St-st-stuttering
Tryin' to explain

I had it up to here
I make the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't goin' say
You say you didn't go out
I know that was a lie
The neighbors said they saw you
Last night driving by
What's up with this girl?
Some supermarket clerk is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more
No more kisses
We won't be makin' love
I'm tired of your shit
I had enough
If I had three wishes you'd see me close my eyes
Real tight and concentrate like 1, 2, 3
And ta da

See one of us has got to go
It's gonna be you cause it's my condo
See the two of us can't be up in here
So one of us is going make it clear
There's no layin' around
No free rides
No playing around, is a rule of mine
But you were cheating around
Tryin' fly free
If it worked like Dream of Jennie
I'd blink yo' ass away from me
No more kisses
We won't be makin' love
I'm tired of yo' SH - IT
I had enough
If I had three wishes you'd see me close
My eyes real tight and concentrate like 1, 2, 3

Ta da
Tryin' make you disappear (dang you still here nigga)
Make you pack yo' bag get the hell (get hell up out) out of here
Ding-dong
The sound (the magic sound the magic sound~~) I'm waiting for
The taxi out side
And the driver's at the door
Oh√úberBot 13:47, 11 April 2006 (PDT) won't please disappear
(It's funny but that what I want hear)
The ----- is in my name so the business got stay why you
St-st-stuttering tryin' to explain
