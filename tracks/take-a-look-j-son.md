Oh oh
Take a look at me


Take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me

Why don't you take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me


Every time
I look around for someone
To help me out from being down
You’re always there by my side
Never asking for too much

You’re always willing to try
So baby
Take a look


Oh, how bad I need someone
(To love me for me)
Could you be the one
(To set my heart so free?)

How I need you, girl
(Oh, oh, to show that you care)
I’m in need of love
(Somebody to share)


Take a look at me
And tell me what you see
(Tell me, baby)
I need somebody to love me for me

Why don't you take a look at me
(Take a look)
And tell me what you see
(Tell me what you see)
I need somebody to love me for me


Can somebody help me out
And tell me is this a dream
Or so it seems
That this is love is rare

Do you really care?
I need to need to know right now
That you'll always be there






Oh, how I need someone
(Oh, yeah)
To love me for me
Could you be the one
(Could you be the one?)
To set my heart free

How I need you bad
(Yeah)
To show that you care
I’m in need of love
(Just take a look)
Somebody to share



Take a look at me
