It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking about a girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one.

But her voice seemed to answer
The echoing silence
From yesterday's asking
And waiting
And listening
For something resembling
A song to be sung back to me.

It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking about a girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one.

And her eyes seemed quicksilver reflecting
The prisms I kindled
Uneclipsed by the darkness
Of loving's mirages
That swindle the heart with the shadow of me.

And her love seemed to offer a solution
For endless beginings and so I went spinning
Into her to love her,
But found her one answer
For loving and losing the same.

It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking about a girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one...
