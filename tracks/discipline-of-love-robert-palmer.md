You naughty girl: so sharp and dry
Don't fill yourself with foolish pride
You wanted me to notice you
But when I came, you cut me
Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love â some discipline
You wild child
How sweet you smile
Your crystal ball â it's broken
Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love â some discipline
Take notice now: my turn to talk
The gate of love â it's narrow
