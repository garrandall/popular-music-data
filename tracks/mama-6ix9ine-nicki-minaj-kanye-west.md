Uh

Murda on the beat so it's not nice!


Tiki Taki, Spanish mami, she a hot tamale (Hot)
Make her spend that money, dummy, go retarded for me (Pop it)
Pop it, pop it, she get started, she won't ever stop it
Little thottie, got her rowdy, choosing everybody

Splish, splash, Apple Bottoms make that ass fat
She got that wet wet, got me blowing through this whole bag (bag)
She got B's, spend some cheese, now they double D's
Thought I had to free, kick her out, my mama coming home at three
Ho thicker-thicker-thicker than a fuckin' Snicker
Drug dealer, professional pot whipper
In the winter, buy your ho a chinchilla (Grrr)
I just bought my bitch them Kylie Jenner lip fillers


Man, oh my God
She Instagram famous but she can't keep a job (Oh
Man, oh my God
Swipe her 30-inch weave on her sugar daddy card (Oh
Man, oh my God
Her doctor got her busting out her motherfuckin' bra (Mmm)
Man, oh my God
She Uber to a nigga with no car
Talking about the relish, I do not embellish
Jacket got wings, True's got propellers
Gave all my old Margielas to my boy Marcellas
Pulled up with no laces, had the whole block jealous
Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't need advice
Wild nigga life, tell 'em read my rights
Man it hot tonight, look out with my ice
15 in the game, baby girl, I got stripes (man)


Ka-Ka-Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls (Chris Pauls)

I was out in Spain rockin' a Medusa head
I ain't never have to give a rap producer head
If I do though, I'ma write a book like Supahead
This ain't wonder that I'm making, this that super bread
Splish, splash, fuck him in a hurry, quick, fast
Still a pink wig, thick ass, whiplash
Got him cummin', cummin', Roger, over, dispatch
Said my box is the best, he met his match
I got all these bitches wantin' to be Barbie dolls
Barbie dreamhouse, pink and purple marble walls
Pull-Pull up in that Barbie 'Rari, finna bury y'all
She threw dirt on my name, ended up at her own burial

Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls
Ka-Ka-Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, Fif' is on call
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls (Chris Pauls)


Tiki Taki, Spanish mami, she a hot tamale (Hot)
Make her spend that money, dummy, go retarded for me (Pop it)
Pop it, pop it, she get started, she won't ever stop it
Little thottie, got her rowdy, choosing everybody
