Okay, let's go

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

For five long years, yeah
I thought I was your man
But I found out now
I'm just a link in your chain

Girl, you got me where you want me
Yeah, I ain't nothing but your fool, yeah
You treated me mean, ow!
Oh, you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

Every chain
Well, it's got a weak link, yeah
I might be weak, child
But I'll give you strength

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

You told me to leave you alone
My father said, come on home
My doctor said, take it easy
But your loving
Well, it's much too strong

I'm added to your
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

Whoa!
Take 'em home!

Well, one of these mornings
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The chain is gonna break, oh, yeah
But up until then, child
I'm gonna take all that I can take

I'm added to your
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools, whoa...

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools

The chain is gonna break
The chain is gonna break
The chain is gonna break
You're never gonna break
This chain of fools, ow!
