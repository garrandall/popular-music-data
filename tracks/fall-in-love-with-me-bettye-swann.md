(Falling in love)
(Falling in love)

What you need
You know I've got
You're the one for me
I've made up my mind about it

Heart and soul
Baby, I'm for you
Believe me, darling
I just adore you

All you've gotta do
For a love that's true
Fall in love in me

If you want a true love
If it's tenderness
You're in need of
Take me and hold me tight
In your arms, control me

Call a doctor now
I'm ready for love
But, darling, baby
It's just got to be your love

Nobody else can make me
Feel the way you do
And I'll be happy
Making you feel that way too

All you've gotta do
For a love that's true
Fall in love in me, yeah

Oh oh, fall in love with me

Now tell me
Tell me what you want
I'm gonna give it to you
And if I don't

It's impossible
And it can't be found
So, baby, there's no need
To shop around

If you'll just trust me
And please be true
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Loving just you

I know you worry
And I know you're blue
But don't worry, baby
I'll take of that too

'Cause what you need
You know I've got
I've got to have you
I've made up my mind about it

So don't try to fight it
Just let yourself go
And happiness is ours, I know

All you've gotta do
For a love that's true
Fall in love in me, yeah

Baby, oh can't you see
I need you, come to me
Oh, baby, I know you're blue
Don't worry, baby...
