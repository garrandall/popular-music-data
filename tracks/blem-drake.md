Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I've had too many
This Virginia done me off already
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

'Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I don't need no advice
You're not here and we both know why
So, move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go crazy

Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

I know we can't keep it together forever
'Cause you're crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go-, look

Just don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel


(Together forever)
Good morning, good afternoon, good night!
I'm here to talk about (More Life)
One second
