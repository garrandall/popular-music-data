She said she wants a man
To always understand
But that's alright for her
Still it ain't enough for me

And she said she wants a guy
To keep her satisfied
But that's alright for her
But it ain't enough for me

Still, I don't care
If he's young or old
(Just make him beautiful)
I just want someone
I can hold on to

I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough)
(From his head down to his toes)
I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough)
(From his head down to his toes)

They say they have to see
His real personality
But that's alright for them
Still it ain't enough for me
I need what the eyes can see, ah
(His anatomy)
If that's alright for them
Still it ain't enough for me

I don't care if he's young or old
(Just make him beautiful)
I just want some strong man
To hold on to

I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough)
(From his head down to his toes)
I want muscles
Whooooa-ho-ho, all over his body
(Make him strong enough)
(From his head down to his toes)

Muscle man, I want to love you
In the sun, or on your body
Come with me, high in the cascades
Let this be, we've got this thing made
Lost at sea, hide the desert
Stay with me, you won't regret it
Take this love, so deep to swim in
Come to me, and let the love in

She said she wants a man
To always understand
But that's alright for her
Still it ain't enough for me

I don't care if he's young or old
(Just make him beautiful)
I just want someone I can hold on to

I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough)
(From his head down to his toes)
I want muscles
Whoooa-ho-ho, all over his body
All over his
(I want) muscles
All, all, all over his body
(I want) muscles
I want all I can get
All over him, all over him
All over him
(I want) muscles, muscles, muscles...
