Here comes dolly dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger.
Dolly dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge...
Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blow out all the other witches on the scene.
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life.
Her tongue can even scratch
The soul out of the devil's wife.
