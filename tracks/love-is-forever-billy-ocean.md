I relive the same old dream day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life, or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

Oh, I believe in love, girl I believe in you
Things you do, I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart can mend if given time
I know why love is forever, love is forever with you

With every passing day I realise
That time will never heal the pain
You're all that I've been thinking of
Can't we fall in love again

Oh, I believe in love, girl I believe in you
Things you do, I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart can mend if given time
I know why love is forever, love is forever with you

Every road will lead me back to you again, my love
Oh I cry so many tears, I couldn't face another day without you
So tell me you care

Oh, oh oohyeah, I believe in love, cause I believe in you
Things you do, I'm falling in love again with you
I tried to let it go but it wouldn't die
I know why love is forever, love is forever with you
