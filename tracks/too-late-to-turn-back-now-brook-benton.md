You don't know how much you hurt me
When you broke our precious vows
But I can't stop loving you
I know it's too late to turn back now
Though I said "Go-o on, be happy, bless you child"
I thought you could guess somehow
My secret heart was sayin'
"Man, it's too late to turn back now"
Was I a fool from the start
Building castles in the skies?
Or did I just dream I saw heaven
Shining in your eyes?
If you knew how much I love you, yes I do
Oh, my darling, your heart would bow
Mmm, yes, you'd know, you'd know why I have said
"It's too late to turn back now"
(Too late to turn back now)
Yes, I love you
(Too late to turn back now)
