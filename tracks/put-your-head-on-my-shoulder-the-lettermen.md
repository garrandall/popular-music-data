Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me, oh, so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way, I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, that you love me too

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder
Put your head on my shoulder
