Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
Mammy blue

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

Now maybe our forgotten son
Who wandered off at twenty one
It's sad to find myself at home
Why don't you, come on around now

If I could only hold your hand
And say I'm sorry yes I am
I'm sure you'd really understand
Oh where are you now, yeah

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue, hey c'mon

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

The house we set up on the hill
It's life is standing standing still
And memories of my childhood
Left in my mind

I've been through all walks of life
I've seen, tired desert lonely nights 
And now without you by my side
How, will I survive

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue

Woah yeah
Oh Yeah
Aw mammy blue

Oh Yeah
Woah yeah
Ah mammy blue. c'mon

Oh Yeah
Woah yeah
Oh mammy blue

Oh Yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Oh my mammy blue
A c'mon a blue a blue now
