He walked into the party
And looked at everybody in the room
She looked into those flaming eyes
She went and stood beside him
I thought she moved just a little too soon
I must admit to my surprise

He would not dance with her
He could not stay he said
He got no time to waste
He took her to, he took her to bed

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think she really knows, oh, yeah

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think she really knows

I could not understand it
I don't know why she followed him home
She had not seen this man before
He touched her with his body
And then she could not leave him alone
They left me standing on the phone

He would not dance with her
He could not stay he said
He got no time to waste
He took her to
He took her to bed

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think she really knows, oh, no

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think she really knows

(He's just a freak)
(He's won't dance)
(He's just a gigolo)
(He's just a freak)
(He's won't dance)
(He's just a gigolo)

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think you really know, oh, yeah

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think you really know

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think you really know, oh, no

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
(He's just a gigolo)
I don't think you really know, oh

(He's just a freak)
He don't love nobody
(He's won't dance)
He just wants your body, baby
