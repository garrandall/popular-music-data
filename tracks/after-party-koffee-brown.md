And you don't stop, keep keep it on
keep it on, keep keep it on
you don't stop, keep keep it on
(welcome to the after party)
keep keep it on, where da party at...

After the party
lets take a little time
and talk about it
whats going through your mind
and as we're shakin
oh it looks so right
i wanna ride
see I would be lyin
if I didn't tell you
it made me wanna flip
and you can't tell me
you aint feelin the same shit
girl its our chemistry
like icing on the cake
i hope you stay
so we can do our thang...

... after the party

don't stop you aint gotta stop (baby do your thang)
don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
doncha want the after party

after the party
lets go somewhere and finish
what we started
cause right from the beginning
i was on it
i know you felt these thighs
you know I felt you rise
so why don't we slide
up off the dance floor
you and me
cause I wanna know
just how deep
does your lovin go
so tell your boys "good night"
cause we're going right...

... after the party

don't stop you aint gotta stop (baby do your thang)
don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
doncha want the after party
(don't stop)
don't stop you aint gotta stop (baby do your thang)
don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
doncha want the after party

sweet baby come with me
cause I wanna do you right
don't hold back, baby where you at
cause I wanna get inside
