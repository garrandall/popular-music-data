Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me, darling, rescue me

With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me, darling, rescue me

When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free, darling, rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me, please, darling, rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see? Darling, rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Yeah! 

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

So good together.
Come to me, sweet, sweet darling.
Rescue me.
Set me free, set me free, yeah
Whoa.
