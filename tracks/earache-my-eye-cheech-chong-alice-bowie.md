My mamma talk'in to me, try'in to tell me how to live
But I don't listen to her cause my head is like a sieve

My daddy, he disowned me cause I wear my sister's clothes
He caught me in the bathroom in a pair of pantyhose

My basketball coach, he done kicked me off the team
For wearing high heeled sneakers and acting like a queen

Gonna tie my pecker to a tree, to a tree!
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree (Gonna tie his pecker to a tree)

The world's comin to an end, I don't even care!
As long as I can have a limo and my orange hair

And it don't bother me if people think I'm funny
Cause I'm a big rock star and I'm making lots of money
Money, Money Money, Money! MONEY! MONEY! AHHHhhhhhh-
Hahahaha...

I'm so bloody rich! Haha Haha ha ha...
I own apartment buildings and shopping centers! Ah Haha ha...
I only know three chords, Hahaha ha ha...
Watch me burn...You fools! Hahahahaha!! ! !
