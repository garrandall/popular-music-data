To the babe, I wanna tell you what's exactly on my mind
I won't stay at home another night while you're out makin' time
I'm well aware of where you go and every girl you see
'Cause whenever I can't find you, boy, my phone begins to ring


And I can't dance to that music you're playin'
Stop, think it over, and rewrite your tune
I can't dance to that music you're playin'
You better get yourself together, you'd better do it soon


Last Friday night the phone rang you said it was Little Joe
We had a one night stand to play down on Cottage Row
If you went down to the park to play, you weren't playin' with your band
'Cause your sax was here at home all night behind your music stand


And I can't dance to that music you're playin'
Stop, think it over, and rewrite your tune
I can't dance to that music you're playin'
You better get yourself together, you'd better do it soon


I can't dance
(I can't dance)
I can't dance
(I can't dance)
I can't dance to what you're singin'
I can't dance to what you're playin'
Uh-huh


I can't dance to that music you're playin'
Stop, think it over, and rewrite your tune
I can't dance to that music you're playin'
You better get yourself together, you'd better do it soon


If you really love me, then unpack your bags and stay
Don't tell me you've got to think it over, got to get away
I've taken all that medicine of yours that I can stand
Now please, change your prescription or I'll find another band


I can't dance to that music you're playin'
Stop, think it over and rewrite your tune
I can't dance to that music you're playin'
You better yourself together, you'd better do it soon
