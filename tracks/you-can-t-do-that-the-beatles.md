I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that


Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that


Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face


So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!


(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)


Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face


So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!
