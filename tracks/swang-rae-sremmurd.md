Know some young niggas like to swang
Ear Drummers
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang, ooh


Know some young niggas like to swang (woo)
Know some young niggas like to swang (woo)
Big bank, take a little bank (woo)
Everday spillin' up drank (drank, uh)
She want the whole crew, shawty brave (woo)
When the money talks, what is there to say? (woo)
Blow away, watch it blow away (phew)
When I die can't take it to the grave (Quavo)


I told my momma I'ma change the game (momma)
So I bought a Lamborgini just to swang (skrrt, skrrt)
An' I know I can't take that fame to the grave (no)
So I'ma go hard, ball like the brave (uh)
Know some young niggas swangin', chain danglin'
Screamin' out that rather rich to be famous (rich)
Go through that check, load them Benjamin, blue faces
Fuckin' bitches, different races (smash)
Caucasian, black and Asian
Different type bitches for different occasions (skrrt)
Think I'm from Houston, way that I'm swangin' (go)
Swangin' it, trap out the bando (bando)
My lifestyle is a rodeo (rodeo)
I feel like the greatest, Muhammad Ali (Ali)
I'm never gon' get with the rubber dough (woo)
Hunnid thousand worth of chains (chains)
Rollie on me, plane jane
An' don't try to take my jewelery
'Cause I know some young niggas like to swang
Swang, swang, swang like I'm tippin' on 4-4 (skrrt)
Sippin' on 4-4 (drank, woo)
Swang, swang, swang like I'm tippin' on 4-4 (skrrt)
Sippin' on 4-4 (drank)
Runnin' up a check like Usain
Kickin' flavour, bitches callin' me Lukaine
Beatin' nigga with a 
But that nigga callin' me Pooty Tang (woah)
Got a super-freak called Mary Jane
When she with me, she act like I'm Rick James
You sure you wanna bet your money, lil' nigga
Walk in an' store, come out with everythin'
As a young nigga comin' up
Starated hangin', baggin', now we with to swangin'
Put that work in the Act' like no Kurt Angle
Make you disappear, nigga, Chris Angel
Grandmomma watchin' me, I got a angel
Money conversation meet up at the round table
Rae Sremmurd them niggas, the beat is disabled
I'm drinkin' on Actavis, expensive flavors (Takeoff)


Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank (drank)
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave (grave, yeah)
