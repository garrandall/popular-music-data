That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up, I'll help you get around

That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

I'll let it go
I'll cut the strings
Today I'm fine

I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but

That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know
