There's a man working in a field
Sees the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
As he sees the color
Of the fields turning

Far away, the men too busy
Getting rich to care
Close their eyes and
Let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see what's going on
In the air around you

There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat, oh
Filling the nets is getting harder

Far away, they bend
The rules so secretly
Close their eyes and
Let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobody else would see

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see what's going on
In the air around you

Far away, too many leaders
Let them get their way
Close their eyes and
Let it all out into the bay
Say they'll clear it up another day

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see that's going on
In the air around you

(Look out)
Look out for the big boys
Telling you everything
They're gonna do

(Look out)
Look out for the fat cat builder man
Turning this into a waste land

(Look out)
Look out for the back room boys
That say the smoke is gonna blow away

(Look out)
Look out for the men
Who say it's okay sitting
In a building far away
