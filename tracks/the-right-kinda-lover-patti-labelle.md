A real man
Strong but tender
Baby thats the kinda man I need
to his love I will surrender
Cause he'll keep his mond on pleasing me

he's the right kinda lover
I'll never need another
sure 'nuff he's got the stuff
he's the right kinda lover fot me

he's the right kinda lover
I'll never need another
sure 'nuff he's got the stuff
he's the right kinda lover fot me

An interesting conversation
Every night when I get down on my knees and pray
I thank the lord for sending me Mr. Right my way
This kind of love had to come from heaven down
I ain't never going to let him go
Because I need this kind of man around

he's the right kinda lover
I'll never need another
sure 'nuff he's got the stuff
he's the right kinda lover fot me
