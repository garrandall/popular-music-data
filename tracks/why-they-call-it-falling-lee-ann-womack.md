It's like jumpin
It's like leapin
It's like walkin on the ceilin
It's like floatin
It's like flyin through the air
It's like soarin
It's like glidin
It's a rocket ship you're ridin
It's a feelin that can take you anywhere

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
I don't know

There was passion
There was laughter
The first mornin after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground
Every time we were together
We talked about forever
I was certain it was Heaven we had found

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
I don't know

But you can't live your life
Walkin in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon
It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kinda like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new

So why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
Now I know

Oh, why they call it fallin
Why they call it fallin
Now I know
