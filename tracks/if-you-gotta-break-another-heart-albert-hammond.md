If you gotta break another heart
Then break it, come on and break it
If you gotta take that kind of chance
Then take it, go on and take it

Anything I say or do will make no difference
In the end you'll go ahead and do what you really wanna do

If you gotta break another heart, then break it
If you gotta take that kind of chance
Then take it, you are free to take it
But don't come runnin' back to me

If you're gonna make another change
Then make it, go on and make it
If you're gonna do it, do it now
Don't leave it 'cause I can't take it

Everybody knows that you were born a drifter
You were born a drifter, baby, you'll never, never settle down

If you gotta break another heart, then break it
If you gotta take that kind of chance
Then take it, you are free to take it
But don't come runnin' back to me

If you gotta play another tune, then play it
If you gotta say what's on your mind
Then say it, go ahead and say it
But don't come runnin' back to me

Da-da-da... then break it
Da-da-da... another chance
Then take it, you are free to take it
But don't come runnin' back to me

If you gotta play another tune...
