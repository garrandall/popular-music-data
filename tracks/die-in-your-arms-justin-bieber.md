Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright

Say you love me
As much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright
Ooh, baby, I know loving you ain't easy
But sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me, yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

If I could die in your arms
I'm a make you believe, girl
That I wouldn't mind, no
Eh, eh, eh, oh
Don't stop baby, no (Alright)
It's what you do to me, yeah
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, whoa, ooo-wooah
Baby, please don't go, girl
No, no, no, no
