Say you love me
As much as I love you
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
Wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, no

If there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause love too hard
Are there any rules
If this a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
'Cause honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
It feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me, yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
Wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, no
