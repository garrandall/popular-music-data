When you just give love, and never get love,
You'dbetter let love depart.

I know it's so, and yet I know,
I can't get you out of my heart.

You made me leave my happy home.
You took my love, and now youve gone,
Since I fell for you...

Love brings such misery and pain.
I guess I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
But I'm in love with you...

You love me, then you snub me.
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.

Well, I guess I'll never see the light.
I get the blues most every night,
Since I fell for you...

Since I fell for you.
