Wrong baby wrong baby wrong 
It ain't the end of the world 
Don't you worry pretty girl 
Cause now that he's gone baby gone baby gone 
You got nothing to lose 
Count the minutes if you want to 
It won't be long baby long baby long 
'Til you find somebody new 

Come on now 
Everyone falls down 
Everyone crawls now and then 
Then they get up again 
You cry if you want to 
That's what we all do 
But if you think you'll never move on you're wrong baby 

Cry baby cry baby cry 
Go on and let it all out 
I ain't leavin' you now 
And we can fly baby fly baby fly 
Let's share a bottle of wine 
We can laugh about the good times 
And you'll know why baby why baby why 
It's gonna be alright 

Come on now 
Everyone falls down 
Everyone crawls now and then 
Then they get up again 
You cry if you want to 
That's what we all do 
But if you think you'll never move on you're wrong baby wrong 

Oh you ain't gone 
baby wrong baby wrong 
There's nothing wrong with movin on 
When you know he's good and gone 

Come on now 
Everyone falls down 
Everyone crawls now and then 
Then they get up again 
You cry if you want to 
That's what we all do 

Come on now 
Everyone falls down 
Everyone crawls now and then 
Then they get up again 
You cry if you want to 
That's what we all do 
But if you think you'll never move on you're wrong baby wrong 
You're wrong baby wrong 
Wrong baby wrong baby wrong
