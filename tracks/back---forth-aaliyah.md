So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood

Now's the time for you to make your move
To the dance floor
So throw your hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care, yeah
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
Ripping up the stage

So if the DJ keep on moving
Don't stop moving
Now let me hear you go
Back and forth
