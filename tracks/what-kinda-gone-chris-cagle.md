I heard the door slam 
And I couldn't tell 
Was it just the wind 
Or was she mad again 
Ah hell she's gettin' in her car
I hallard baby is there somethin' wrong
Thought I heard her say something
Sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well there's gone for good and there's good and gone
Then there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Theres gone for the day and gone for the night
Gone for the rest of your dog-gone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple of beers
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout here

Well its gettin' dark out she ain't back yet
Ain't called home
Turned off the phone
Ah man this mighta not be good
Would have stopped her when she went to leave 
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin' now
Still not sure what gone is all about

Cause there's gone for good 
And there's good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dog-gone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple of beers
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout here

Is it the kinda gone she's at her moms' coolin' down she'll come around
Or the kind that says you had your chance she ain't comin' back

Well there's gone for good 
And there's good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dog-gone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple of beers
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout
What kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout here
What kinda gone
