There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it

Rumour has it all around the town
Someone's looking for a girl like me
Where can she be found
I hope it's who I think it is
I wonder if it's really him
It's got to be the man I love
No one else but him

Rumour has it

They say he's gonna make this girl his everything
He's gonna love her and surround her
With all those beautiful things
It was the most wonderful moment in my life I had
My life ended on that evening
I lost him, Lord it hurt so bad

Rumour has it

You never know just what you've won't until you've lost
And the object of the game is not to pay the cost
Anyone can play the game, there are no rules
And you never know just what you've won until you lose

There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it, rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Such a rumour

I know he's gonna find me
I know this was meant to be
Well you can change a lot of things in your life
But not your destiny
And when you find the best thing in life has come to you
Hold it in your hand real tight or it may slip through

There's a rumour, there's a rumour

You never know just what you've won until you've lost
And the object of the game is not to pay the cost
Anyone can play the game, there are no rules
And you never know just what you've won until you lose
And you never know just what you've won until you lose

There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it, rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
