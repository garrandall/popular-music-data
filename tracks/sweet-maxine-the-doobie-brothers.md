She can capture your heart, when they start the music playin'
Sparkle in her eyes, you better be wise or you will end up losin' your mind
I said baby, pretty baby, got to get my hands on you
Somethin's got a hold on
Somethin's got a hold on me
Somethin's got a hold on
Somethin's got a hold on me
She was born with it in her soul
Lord she knows how to rock and roll
She was born with it in her soul
Lord she knows how to rock and roll

She's the answer to a poor boy's dream
Never seen such a sweet young thing
She's a teaser, love to squeeze her
An actress from a fantasy scene
I said baby, pretty baby
Open your eyes to the truth
Somethin's got a hold on
Somethin's got a hold on me
Somethin's got a hold on
Somethin's got a hold on me

She's got the power, power in her soul
She's got the power, power, rock and roll
