Sock
Oh, I'm so ready
Sock
Come on now, baby
Sock it
Honey in the beehive
Honeybunch, ha
Every time you kiss me
Hits me like a punch
Ready ready, ready, ready, ready
Ready or not
I want, yes I do, what you got
Sock it to me baby, baby
Sock it to me baby, baby
(Gotta) Sock it to me baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it
Boogaloo, my baby
Across the floor
Every time you shake it girl
I like it more
Gimme, gimme, gimme gimme gimme
Something sweet
Knock me
Ooh, off my feet
Sock it to me baby, baby
Sock it to me baby, baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it

Sock, baby
Sock it
Honey in the beehive
Honeybunch
Every time you kiss me
Hits me like a punch
Ready ready, ready, ready, ready
Ready or not
I want, yes I do, what you got
Sock it to me baby, my baby
Sock it to me baby, my baby
You've gotta sock it to me, baby
Sock sock it to me, baby
Sock it to me, baby
Sock it
