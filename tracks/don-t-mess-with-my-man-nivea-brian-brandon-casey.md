It was hard to find a brotha that was down for me
So I'm tellin' everybody let him be
Cuz he's mine and I can't take no pigeons tryna take my baby
So I thought I had to let you know
Find someone that you can call your own
Cuz now you're walkin' in the danger zone
And if I touch you I'll be wrong

If you mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Got my girls, got my man
So find your own and leave mine alone
Don't mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man

It was hard to find a girl that's really down for me
Seems like a lot of niggas tryin' me
'Cuz they trynna take my baby, oh what the hell, naw!
So now you really betta check yourself
Messin' with my girl is bad for your health and
So you know you will be dealt with
Betta find your own girl

If you mess with my girl,

Got my niggas, got my girl
So find your own and leave mine alone
Don't mess with my girl

Girl I'm warning you, if you want my man
You should just keep ya hands to yourself, now now

And playa I'm warnin' you, if you want my girl
I suggest that you look but don't touch, now-now

It was hard to find a brotha that was down for me, don't mess with my man
It's hard to find a girl that's really down for me, don't mess with my girl
Hard to find a brotha that was down for me, don't mess with my man
So hard to find a girl that's down for me, don't mess with my girl
