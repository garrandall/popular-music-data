You're leavin' tongue marks on the carpet
And I know what you're lookin' at
You would walk on your lips through busted glass
If you could get next to that

You think this is love
Your education starts today
So you think this is love?
So tell me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Not bad enough

So you put a hold on happiness
....a day, a week, a year
You got to bring somethin' to this party, boy
If you party here

And if you're lookin' for love
You better look some other way
If you're lookin' for love
I have to ask you
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Not bad enough

She gave you love and affection
Enough to weather any season
You found an excuse to walk away
But you didn't find no reason

And you talk about love
But you don't know what it means
Yeah, you talk about love
So tell me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Not bad enough
