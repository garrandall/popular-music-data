Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you


You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you


Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
