She said I don't spend time
Like I really should
She said she don't know me
Anymore
I think she hates me deep down
I know she does
She wants to erase me

A couple days no talking
I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you
Nothing helps
I can't stop missing you


It's like I'm her new nightmare
She ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete

Knowing someone you love
Don't feel the same way about you
Memories, they soon delete

A couple weeks no talking
I see my baby
I've missed you so damn much
Hey
I wish we could start over
I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

She said

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you
Nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

'Cause I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you are
You might hear me

I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you go
You might see me


Hello, uh, I'm Yeezy
She said, "Hi, I'm Aria."
No, you a angel
You wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea
They built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up

I know I seen you before
But don't know where I seen you
Oh I remembered now
You're something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool
But don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress
You take it to the cleaners

Sure enough a week later
I'm in extra love
And everybody know she mine
So she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club
Show her extra love
We just praying the new fame
Don't get the best of us

But all good things gotta come to an end
She let it go to her head
No, not my Aria
The height of her shopping
Was writer's-blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway
I hope you die, Aria

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you
Nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
