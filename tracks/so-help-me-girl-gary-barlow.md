You could've kissed me, like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from saying, something I'll never take back
You could've held me like there was no chance
Of me waking up where I am
You could've stopped short of every dream I've ever had

So help me girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

Oh yeah
You gotta help me girl

You had to be there until the sun came up
Making last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else
Now look what you've gone and done
You had to love me, till I just can't get enough

Please, help me girl...

So help me girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself

So help me girl you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself...
No, baby
I can't help myself...
I can't help myself...
So help...girl. 

You've got to help me girl. 
I'm falling down... (falling, falling, falling)
I'm falling down... (You've got me falling down!)
Cause I'm falling down... (You've got me falling down!)
Falling...(You've got me falling down!)
