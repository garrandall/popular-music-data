Yeah
Well, well, well
Yeah...hey...
Yeah
Hey...hey...
Oh

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candlelight
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, oh

Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you, alright now, oh

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the mornin' comes
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me, well

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be, well
When you're lovin' me, when you're lovin' me, oh

Love to be
Ridin' the waves of your love, enchanted with your touch
And it seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, alright now
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you, you got me, girl

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, alright now
All that I'm givin', givin'
Is for the love of you, oh, yes, I am

Paradise I have within
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key, well
And this I see, for I see

Now and then I lose my way
Usin' words that try to say
What I feel, yeah
Love is real, oh, love is real, oh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

I know that I'm livin'
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm livin'
For the love, love of you

Every, every day I'm livin'
For love of you
I'm livin' for the love
Each and every day

I'm, oh, whoa, I'm, oh, yes, I am
I wanna say it one more time
Said I'm livin'
For the love

Each and every day I'm, oh, whoa, I'm
Lord knows I am
Write that down
Said that I'm livin'
For the love, love of you
Oh oh
