Just as much as ever
I need you and want you to be here
Just as much as ever
I love you, and always will, my dear
Even though we two are parted
My feelings for you never drop
For loving you is something I started
And don't know how to stop
Just as much as ever
I'm hoping that you'll be mine again
Darlin', 'cause I'll never be satisfied till then
For I am still the same old me
With the same old love for you
Just as much as ever, my heart beats for you
(Just as much as ever)
(I'm hoping that you'll be mine again)
Darling, 'cause I'll never be satisfied till then
For I am still the same old me
With the same old love for you
Just as much as ever, my heart beats for you
