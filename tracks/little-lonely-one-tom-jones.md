If you give me just a little while
I'll turn each tear drop to smile

He promised happiness
But he left you loneliness
What makes you hurt inside
True love or injured pride


Oh little lonely one now don't you cry
You'll forget him by and by
And if you give me just a little while
I'll turn each tear drop to a smile

I know what you've been through
Your heart's been broken too
He kept you on a string
While you gave your everything

(Repeat Chorus twice)
It will be hard for me
To fight his ever-loving memory
But give me one more chance
And I'll find true romance

Oh little lonely one now don't you cry
You'll forget him by and by
And if you give me just a little while
I'll turn each tear drop to a smile
And if you give me just a little while
I'll turn each tear drop to a smile
And if you give me just a little while
I'll turn each tear drop to a smile
