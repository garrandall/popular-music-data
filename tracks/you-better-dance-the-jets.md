Hey
Heartache, no cure
Broken down
You see I've heard it all, all before
Leave your trouble behind and walk out the door

Ain't no sense crying out loud
You better get dancing out in the crowd
You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance
Dance all day
You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance

You better dance
Hey!

Can't work, and nothing to eat

Ain't no sense crying out loud
You better get dancing in the crowd
You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance
Dance all day
You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance

You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance
Dance all day
You better dance
Dance your troubles away
You better dance

Dance, dance, dance
