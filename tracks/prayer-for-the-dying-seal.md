Fearless people, careless needle
Harsh words spoken, and lives are broken
Forceful ageing, help me I'm fading
Heaven's waiting, it's time to move on

Crossing that bridge, with lessons I've learned
Playing with fire, and not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on

Just say die, and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know what's got into me

Been crossin' that bridge, with lessons I've learned
Playing with fire, and not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on

It goes on

Crossing that bridge with lessons I've learned
Playing with fire, and not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
