Just another night
And I'm all alone
I wonder where you are
Who you're holding

And I'm wasting time
By the telephone
It gets harder when there's no way of knowing

I always thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow
But it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round
But it's over now

When I close my eyes
I can see your face
There was still so much to discover
All the time we shared
Can't be erased
Now you're in the arms of another

I always thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow
But it's over now
Thought you'd be comin' 'round
But it's over now

If you broke my heart
I can't let it show
I can take the pain
I can't let you go
Some people change
I guess it had to be
Even though you're gone now
You still mean so much to me

Just another day
I'm still holdin' on
No matter how I try
I can't shake this feeling
Yeah I'm sitting here
Like nothing's wrong
I'm still lookin' for someone to believe in

I always thought we'd be together someday
There was nothing that could keep me away
Coulda worked it out somehow
But it's over now
