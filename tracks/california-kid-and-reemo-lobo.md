I met him one day in the Rockies
Where the night air tasted like wine
The winter was hard and had me starving
When the two of them found me in time

Then one night I crashed north of Reno
I'd been on the road too long
Then I woke to the warmth of her fire
And the sweet welcome home of his song

It was the California Kid and Remo
Lending me a helping hand
It was the California Kid and Remo
Teaching me to love
And teaching me to live off the land

I thanked them and headed for Oregon
The trees were the walls of my home
But the rain soaked my bones every morning
And the chill made me feel more alone

And just when I thought I should end it
The world didn't need men like me
My mind heard the song of my two friends
And the sun started shining on me
