Be good to me, baby
Treat me like a woman should
Keep me happy when
The going get tough
Just like my mama would

Release me from the pain
Every morning of every day
And don't forget to listen to
Every word that I have to say

Honey, try and understand
Cause I need to be understood
Cause it's your responsibility
Making me feel good

Be good to me, baby
And I'll do things
To please you most
I'll be a pillar of strength for you
I'll be your leaning post

Don't believe idle gossip
And all the things
That the people say
You know the lies they tell
When you head and walk away

When you feel down and out
I'll be there with my
Arms stretched out

Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

When you need a friend
I'll be there til the bitter end
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Be good to me, baby
And I'll do things
To please you most
I'll be a pillar of strength for you
I'll be your leaning post

And if you're having heartches
Honey, you know I'll ease the pain
All I want you to do for me
Is treat me like a man

Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Oh, and without a doubt
I'll be there with my
Arms stretched out
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

When you need a friend
I'll be there til the bitter end
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Honey, try and understand
Cause I need to be understood
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Without a doubt
I'm coming with my
Arms stretched out
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Try and understand
Cause I need to be understood
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you

Oh, without a doubt
I'll be there with my
Arms stretched out
Be good to me, baby
And I'll be good to you...
