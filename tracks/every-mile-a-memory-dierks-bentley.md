Country Roads, old theater marquee signs
Parkin' lots, and billboards flyin' by
Spanish moss, little hick town squares
Wild roses on a river bank: girl its almost like you're there

Oh, every mile, a memory; every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

Red sun down, out across the western sky
Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seein' 'em with you baby: oh, they never do it right, no

Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

Funny how no matter where I run
Round every bend I only see
Just how far I haven't come

Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time you and me
Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
