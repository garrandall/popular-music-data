Girrrl, Baby --
What gave it away?
You had somethin' on your mind
that you didn't know how to say
Ohhh, How can I love you 
if you keep runnin' away --
Doin' everything in my power to make to make you stay --
Hey baby -- keep runnin' away -- Whowwww!!!
Checking out see what I'm all about --
And in your mind -- you can have no bout 
Have no bout -- all ya' do is check it out -- Whowwww!!! 

Your vibes, baby -- lemme tell you about 'em
is what I kept feelin' inside --
I was tryin' to be a stubborn type of fellow
but I kept holdin' holdin back my pride --

How can we make love to each other 
If you keep runnin' away -- if you keep runnin' away
Doin everything in my heart to make you stay 
Make ya stay, Make ya stay 
Doin' everything in my power to make to make you stay
Hey baby -- can't stop runnin' away -- Whowwww!!!
Checking out see what I'm all about 
Don't have to listen to your friends  
cause you'll find out -- all ya' do is check it out -- Whowwww!!! 

Get on down -- you'll have to get up
if you want to get down 
I'll give you my love -- 
And I'll put it where you want it --
but you gotta' stick around

How I can make love to you 
if you keep runnin' away --
Whoa --
Doin' everything in my power to make to make you stay 
Make ya stay, Make ya stay 
Girl pick it up, let it lay, let it lay -- Owwww

Checking out see what I'm all about 
And in your mind -- you can have no bout
Have no bout -- all ya' do is check it out -- Oooohhhhoooowwww!!! 
Ohh, Yeah -- Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hmmmm - Owwwwhhh!!

Get on up, Get on down --
Ohhh, I'll be around when your sun goes down
Hey baby -- Gotta, Gotta, Gotta
Whoo hoo ooh ooh hey come here oh  yeahh yeah
Oh Baby 
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Oh Baby, -- Oooohhhhoooowwww!!!
Baby!
