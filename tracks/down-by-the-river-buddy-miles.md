Oh, oh...

Be on my side
I'll be your side, baby
There is no reason
For you to hide

It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride

Oh, sha la la, the weather
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

Down by the river
I shot my baby

You take my hand
I'll take your hand, babe
Together, we'll get away

This much sadness
Is too much sorrow
It's impossible for me to stay
Yeah, yeah

Oh, sha la la, the weather
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

Down by the river
I shot my baby

Down by the river
Be on my side
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason to hide

It's so hard for me
To stand here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride

Oh, sha la la, the weather
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
I shot my baby
