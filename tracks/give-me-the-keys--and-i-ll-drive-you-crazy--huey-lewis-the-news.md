I can see you've got your motor running
Don't you think you're movin kinda slow
If you feel the way I feel
Let me get behind the wheel
We don't need any destination baby
Anywhere you wanna go

Give me the keys, and I'll drive you crazy
Give me the keys, I'll drive you out of your mind

Honey we don't need no registration
We don't need no license anymore
Let me in the driver's side
And we can take a ride
We don't need to ask directions baby
I know where you wanna go

Give me the keys, and I'll drive you crazy
Give me the keys, I'll drive you out of your mind
Give me the keys, and I'll drive you crazy
Give me the keys, I'll drive you out of your mind

Maybe we'll just ride into the sunset
Drive around til who knows where or when
And when it gets a little dark
We'll find a quiet place to park
And when the sun comes up in the morning baby
Do it all over again
