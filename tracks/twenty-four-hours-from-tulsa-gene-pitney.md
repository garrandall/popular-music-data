Dearest darlin' I had to write to say that I won't be home anymore
'cause something happened to me while I was drivin' home
And I'm not the same anymore
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I saw the welcoming light and stopped to rest for the night

And that is when I saw him as I pulled in outside of the small motel he was there
And so I walked up to him, asked where I could get something to eat
And he showed me where.
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
He took me to the cafÃ©, and he asked if I would stay, I said "OK"

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play and night time turned into day as we were dancin'
Closely, all of a sudden I lost control as he held me tight
And he kissed me, carressed me, told me he die
Before he would let me out of his arms arms

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I hate to do this to you but I love somebody new, what can I do?
And I can never, never, never---go home again.
