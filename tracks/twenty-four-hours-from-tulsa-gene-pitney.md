Dearest darling
I had to write to say that I won't be home anymore
'Cause something happened to me
While I was driving home
And I'm not the same anymore
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I saw a welcoming light
And stopped to rest for the night
And that is when I saw her
As I pulled in outside of the small motel she was there
And so I walked up to her
Asked where I could get something to eat
And she showed me where
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
She took me to the caf√©
I asked her if she would stay, she said "OK"

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play
And night time turned into day
As we were dancing, closely
All of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her
Told her I'd die before I would let her out of my arms
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I hate to do this to you
But I love somebody new, what can I do?
And I can never, never, never go home again
