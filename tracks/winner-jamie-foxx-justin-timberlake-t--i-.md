T.I.P.
Ay, Jamie, JT
It bout time to get back hot again man
You know I'm fresh out that thang, let's go
You know you lookin' at a winner
You know I'm so up there
You so out there, you so not here
You see we so up there and we so out there


I'm wakin' up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage, and fuckin' performin'
Bustlin' through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' misses I must of been scorin'
Speakin' of the misses, I'm watchin' them pourin'
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan


Ah Ah
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut
I make them cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Let me say it again
Ah Ah
You ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make them cut the check
So hate on but guess what


I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner


I'm steppin' out in the evening
Keep winnin' and screamin'
You gotta be cheatin'
But I'm so greedy
I make this look easy
And if they thinkin' I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TVs to screens and DVDs
To CDs to MP3s overseas
I got no time to talkin' is borin'
Just look at me soarin'
Feeling like Jordan


Ah Ah
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut
I make them cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Let me say it again
Ah Ah
If you ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make them cut the check
So hate on but guess what


I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner


That's right
You see the, Porsche panamera got them in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McClaren even scarier
Hear me turnin' corners burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
You got is Maserati's, new Ferrari's, I got one of each
My future bright tight like the bitch died in front of me
Turn pain into progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die in the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no auto-tune
Been in the lead, you say you seen king follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac
Hahaha


I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball (It's the king bitch)
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a
Winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner (Ha ha)


Ay man, you thought a lil vacation gon' hold me back homeboy
Man I'm back man, brighter than ever, understand that
If you didn't like me then, you gon' hate me now nigga
