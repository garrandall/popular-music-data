Step left around and together with the rest
Now, here comes the music
Here comes the music
One, two, three, four
Are we getting funky

There she go, there she don't
You donâ€™t want to, you don't need to
Feel the warmth

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

One, two, three, four
Oh world, keep on
Oh world, keep on
One, two, three, four

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

Oh world
One, two, three, four
You don't need her

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

One, two, three, four
