Yo Carl man, come here, lemme school you to some shit
Yo what up dud
Remember that girl you said was nineteen somethin'
Yeah I remember that shorty
She was not nineteen
Word! Yes she is she nineteen
Nigga I followed her to school that's how I know
Nigga I followed her to school you know I don't be into that
Dog, dog, she showed me some ID bee word up
Niggaz got to jail for that
Lot a niggaz go to jail
See you not a regular nigga right there, I know I know
Her friend ain't wanna give me the pussy
You wanna know what that bitch said to me
What happened?


 - I really wanna mess wit you
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you
And I don't mind caressing on you
But I need to be, I need to be
You know I need to be loved by you
You know I need to be hugged by you
And I can't wait to be touched by you
Cuz I need to be, cuz I need to be


How many niggas out remember the
First time they try to take a girl virginity
And through the bullshit, you lost your identity, and lost your cool
Cuz you ain't know what to tell all your niggas at school
I had niggas making bets like, did he fuck her yet?
Ask her did he touch her bra, when I say nah they say ahh
So tommorrow I use that pressure to undress her
But the more I caress her, more I feel like a molester
So I wait for the day deserve it
But every time I go to touch it, then she say I hurt it
I can't even talk sex, and then she say I'm perverted
And then she say, Mase. why we can't wait? What, I ain't worth it?
It ain't that but girl you never say I go too fast
All I'm seatin' when I'm eating, or goin' in your ass
I guess you like that, huh




Now mother may I? Yes you may
I told her 'bout all the baddest bitches from Harlem to LA
Now anything that Mase can blaze, gotta get away
See girl, work is work and baby, when I'm workin' I get paid
For overnight stays that's gonna cost you breakfast on trays
No need for shower curtains, we bath in camays
I live the willie lifecuz that's the style that I portray
We pop crystal like my niggas got a raise
See nowadays man you got to know these bitches age
Cuz they ass be real fast when they be goin' through that phase
You fuck a girl that's young, and you gonna end up in the cage
Cuz her moms ain't tryin' to hear that you never knew her age
And naughty is the only way that Bad Boy plays
Fuck them hoes, have them girls recoverin' for days
A nigga like me, I have a girl head in a daze
And I never eat pussy cuz I'm too stubborn in my ways, come on




I need to be licked from my head to my feet
To make a long story short, girl I need me a freak
She can be fat, black, light skin, type slim
Matter fact shorty ain't even got to like me
As long as when she grab my meat, she take it down real deep
Till her body feel weak, then I'm fallin asleep
See I ain't talkin 'bout these pre-madonna bitches you meet
I need a girl that if I ask her handle me and my peeps
Get down dirty, and lick ice down my butt cheeks
Then she wiggle, then I giggle, then she feel my nutsy
Then if she give my dick a kiss, probably give her clit a kiss
Then I hit it from the back, then I yell whose shit is this
Then I go so hard that she need her guts fixed
If she make my nuts itch, I kill that slut bitch
I done been around the world, uh huh, and never met a girl
That's so thorough  that could suck a dick until my toes curl, uh huh
