All we wanna do is make you bounce
Monifah, would you turn me out?
Show me what your thing is all about

All we wanna do is make you bounce (turn around)
Monifah, could you turn me out?
Show me what your thing is all about

Do you really wanna touch it?
Do you really wanna mess with me tonight?
And if you know how I like it
Would you call my name and give it to me right?

Could you just put that thing on me?
So I could just freak on you
And you could just freak on me
And I will give it to you all night long (come on)
I'ma show your body what your lips are doing wrong

Do you really wanna touch it?
Do you really wanna fuck with me tonight?
Do you really
And if you know how I like it
Would you call my name and give it to me right? (Call my name)

Slow love just feels so good to me (good to me)
Could you just move it on up? (just move it on up)
Cause I'm in ecstasy, ecstasy
And I will give it to you all night long
I'ma show your body what your tongue is doing wrong
(That's how I like it)
Do you really wanna touch it?
Do you really wanna fuck with me tonight?
(Do you really want to fuck with us
Do you really want to mess with us)
And if you know how I like it
Would you call my name and give it to me right?

Give it to me
Give it to me
Call my name
(Like that)
This boy's shyness got me wet like crazy
I want it more and more
When you call my name and spank me
(Slap that ass baby)
Do you really wanna touch it?
Do you really wanna mess with me tonight?
(Do you really want to mess with us
Do you really want to fuck with us )
And if you know how I like it
Would you call my name and give it to me right?
(Come on)
Give, give, give...

Do you really wanna touch it?
Do you really wanna fuck with me tonight?
And if you know how I like it
Would you call my name and give it to me right?
(I like it baby)
