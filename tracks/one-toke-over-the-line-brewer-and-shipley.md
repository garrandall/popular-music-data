One toke over the line sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Waitin' for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hopin' that the train is on time
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Who do you love, I hope it's me
I've been a-changin', as you can plainly see
I felt the joy and I learned about the pain that my momma said
If I should choose to make a part of me, would surely strike me dead

Now I'm one toke over the line sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

I'm waitin' for the train that goes home sweet Mary
Hopin' that the train is on time
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

I sailed away a country mile
Now I'm returning and showing off my smile
I met all the girls and loved myself a few
And to my surprise
Like everything else that I've been through
It opened up my eyes and now I'm

One toke over the line sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Don't you just know I waitin' for the train that goes home sweet Mary
Hopin' that the train is on time
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line



Don't you just know I waitin' for the train that goes home sweet Mary
Hopin' that the train is on time
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line



I was born to give and take
And as I keep growin' I'm gonna make some mistakes
The sun's gonna set and the bird is gonna wing
They do not lie
My last wish will be just one thing
Be smilin' when I die

I want to be
One toke over the line sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Don't you just know I waitin' for the train that goes home sweet Mary
Hopin' that the train is on time
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over line
One toke, one toke over the line
