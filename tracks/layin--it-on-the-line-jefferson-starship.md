You see it every day in every way 
We all hear the same routines 
They all say that it's okay 
Just let us take care of everything 
So we lay it on the line 

Layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line) 
Layin' it all, right on the line 
Just layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line) 
Layin' it all, we're livin on the front line 

I can see it in the faces 
We got trouble in the streets tonight 
And power keeps us in our places 
And it doesn't matter if you're left or right 
You lay it on the line 

Layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line) 
Just layin' it all, right on the line 
Layin' it on the line, (layin' it on the line) 
Layin' it all, right on the line 

Take it to the wilderness 
Into the jungle sun 
Lookin' for the voice of reason 
Inside this Babylon 

Got U.S. boys on foreign soil 
Spillin' their blood to keep the peace 
Cities will vanish in turmoil 
While the sheiks lay sleepin' on the beach 
We lay it on the line 

Layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line) 
Layin' it all, right on the line 
Just layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line) 
Layin' it all, right on the line 
Layin' it on the line 
Just layin' it all 
Layin' it on the line 
Just layin' it all
