Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
To share what seems to be the life
That you could cherish me as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think
That man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear
Make you see
That you're driving me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who say they'd love you
With all the rest of their lives
When all they wanted was to
Touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could mold you into someone
That could cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do
Cherish you
And I do
I cherish you
Yes I do
I cherish you
