Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, oh yeah
Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, yeah
Well, now wear some boxing gloves in case some fool might start a fight
You know what I'm sayin'

Put on your hi-heel sneakers, put your wig hat on your head, oh
Put on your hi-heel sneakers, slap that wig right on your head, yeah
Well, I'm pretty sure now baby, pretty soon you're gonna knock 'em dead
Oh gonna mess around baby all right

Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, oh yeah
Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight
Well, now wear some boxing gloves in case some fool might start a fight
You know what I'm

Put on your hi-heel sneakers, put your wig hat on your head, oh
Put on your hi-heel sneakers, slap that wig right on your head
Well, I'm pretty sure now baby, pretty soon you're gonna knock 'em dead
Walk around baby, walk around

Put on your hi-heel sneakers, put your wig hat on your head, all right
Put on your hi-heel sneakers, slap that wig right on your head
Well, I'm pretty sure now baby, pretty soon you're gonna knock 'em dead
All right take it home baby, take it home
