Hmm
Tell me about your childhood

Oh!
At the tender age of three
I was hooked to a machine
Just to keep my mouth from spouting junk
Ha!
Must have took me for a fool
'Cause they chucked me out of school
'Cause the teacher knew I had the funk

But tonight I'm on the edge
Let us chuck me in the fridge
'Cause I'm burning up
Yow! I'm burning up
With the vision in my brain
And the music in my veins
And the dirty rhythm in my blood

They are messing with my heart
And they're messing with my heart
And they're messing with my heart
Won't stop messing with my
Oh, ripping me apart!

Hyperactive, when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown
Hyperactive, and the night is young
And in a minute I'll blow!

And they're messing with my heart
So, how long have you been having these delusions?
Keep on messing with my heart
Hm, please, tell me more about your mother
Oh, ripping, ripping, ripping, ripping
Ripping me apart!

Semaphore out on the floor
Messages from outer space
Deep heat for the feet
The rhythm of your heartbeat
'Cause the music of the street
It isn't any rap-attack (Oh)
It isn't any rap-attack (Oh)
Rap-a, rap-a, rap-a
T-t-t-t-t-tack

I can reach into your homes
Like an itch in your headphones
You can't turn it up (Yow!)
Yuh-huh
I'm the shape in your back room
I'm the breather on the phone
And I'm burning up (Ow!)

But there's one thing I must say
'Fore they lock me up again
You'd be safer at the back
When I'm having an
Attack, attack, attack, attack!

Hyperactive, when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm tall
Hyperactive, as the day is long
Hyperactive, in my bones
Hyperactive, in your phones
Hyperactive, and the night is young (Oh)
Hyperactive, when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown
Hyperactive, till I'm dead and gone

Stand up, hyperactivate!
Get up, hyperactivate!
Wise up, hyperactivate!
London, hyperactivate!

Hyperactive, when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm tall
Hyperactive, as the day is long
Hyperactive, in my bones
Hyperactive, in your phones
Hyperactive, and the night is young (Oh)
Hyperactive, when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown
