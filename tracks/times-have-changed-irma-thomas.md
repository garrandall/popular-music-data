There was a time
When you could snap your fingers
And I'd come running
Running to you
But try it now
Come on, try it now
And you're gonna find
When you do
That times have changed
You can't hurt me like before
Times have changed
And I don't love you anymore
There was a time
When I would smile and take the pain
And you would tear my dreams apart
Or break my heart in two
But try it now come on, try it now
And you're gonna find
That when you do
That times have changed
You can't hurt me like before
Times have changed
And I just don't love you anymore
Somebody new I met
Made me forget
The memories we knew
That broken heart I got from you
Try it now 'cause you know that
Times haves changed
You know that times have changed
You know that times have changed
Oh, times have changed
