There's an all out war tonight
Here's the chance to win the fight
Or lose your life
Listen for the battlecry
Lay your heart upon the line
Tonight, it's time
Defend your crime

Oh, oh, you better get ready
Oh, oh, 'cause my aim is steady

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing or it's not enough
Whoa-oh, I take no prisoners in the game of love

It's a one-on-one attack
I've got you cornered
And you can't go back to what you had
You can't do that
Oh, I've waited long enough for you
I want to capture everything
Your love can do
There is no rescue

Can't win, 'cause I won't let you
So give in, 'cause I'm coming to get you

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing or it's not enough
Oh-oh, I take no prisoners in the game of love

You're gonna need somebody
When you let go of the fight on your hands
I wanna be the body
Breaking your fall, holding your hand

Oh, oh, you better get ready
Oh, oh, 'cause my aim is steady
My aim is steady, said my aim is steady

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing or it's not enough
Oh-oh, I take no prisoners in the game of love

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing or it's not enough
Oh-oh, I take no prisoners in the game of love, love

Take no prisoners in the game of love
All or nothing or it's not enough
Oh-oh, I take no prisoners in the game of love

Take no prisoners in the game of love
All or nothing, in the game of love
In the game of love...
