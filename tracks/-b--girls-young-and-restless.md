Hey, Slim. Come here, check this out
Uh-uh, wait. Let me tell you something
If you ain't got a Bronco, a BMW, a band or big bank
Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo I think it's about time
We gonna tell Slim about ourselves
Believe that

Now let's bring up the subject
[?] Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the "B" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind

Now you can [?]
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco

Everything is chill
With the A C pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain

"B" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars

We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call "B" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.

Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty

Well she was [?]
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And [?] doctor [?]

When I took her to [?]
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz

She said "We need a Benz"
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain:

Now I was pushin' on my rims
With no context [?]
It wasn't BMW
It was BMX
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, "My name is Janet
But my friends call me Jane."

I said, "Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?"
She said
"Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!"
You call yourself Jane
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain:

Now me and [?] was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And pass [?] bottles [?]
So I said, [?]
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer

She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, "Can't you see me walkin' my nigga?"

"Hey, so? He's a punk!"

She said, "I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!"

She came in my face, she kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk, I put the clip in the MAC-10

I'm tired of you "B" girls
Yeah, that's your name!

And if you don't know what 'B' means
Let us explain:

Bars on a Cadillac Brougham
Cadillac Brougham
