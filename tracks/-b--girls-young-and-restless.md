(Woo, Yeah, All Right, All right)


I'mma make you hit the dance floor with this one
Don't got a man but you better get one
Girl, pick it up and make it go low
Put it on him good, gotta make him wine fo' it
Hands in the air if you're getting to the money
Middle of the party and I'm bizzin' like honey
Dude at the bar so smooth like butter
Ass like woah, yeah, word to your mother


With a song like this, don't it make you wanna dance?
Get out your seat and grab a hand, don't be afraid to take a chance
When it feel like this, don't it put you in the mood?
Right foot, left foot, just feel the groove
Put your hands in the air, get in the mood


In the air (move yo body, move yo body)
In the air (move yo body, move yo body)
In the air (move yo body)
(Till you're grabbin' on the clouds)
In the air
In the air (hands up, hands up)
In the air (hands up, hands up)
Till you're grabbin' on the clouds
In the air


Aye, cameras pop, look at who just throw the show
Got they' hands up in the air, wave my chad 
Rappers lookin' like my sons, got more kids than Shawty Lo
If they want a grind game, I do more than tie the scope
I've been smokin' so long, I bring swishas by the boat
Your bitch choosin' so hard, eenie meenie miney moe
Would've thought I was in court, the way she noticed me
Money grown, guess that's why I bought the older me
High for so long, I don't recognize the sober me
Pourin' out weed, my definition of poetry
No Genre the label, recognized globally, ha
You're only poppin' if it's locally
My hittas tussed up the night
With the snub, in case you get it fucked up tonight
But I can't lie, man, I love this life
I hold my team down, but we goin' up tonight, the label




In the air (put yo hands in the air)
In the air (put yo hands in the air)
In the air
Till you're grabbin' on the clouds
In the air (put yo hands in the air)
In the air (put yo hands in the air)
In the air
Till you're grabbin' on the clouds
In the air


All the sexy ladies in the house tonight
All try to get it right tonight
Hands in the air all night tonight
Damn, I'm lookin' out of sight tonight, I'm alright tonight
By the boss with the squad, we flexin'
Two steppin', we reppin', VIP section
Young and restless, swag on fleek, givin' lessons
Class in session

And I'm the professor, so are there any questions?
She said come and get this work, I gave her extra credit
Only the best get accepted, therefore they extra jealous
Used to sneak on campus, battling freshmen
Summa cum laude, dorm room shawty
Hit a cheerleader with a porn move shawty
And I don't know what loser sound like
But I know what good music sound like when it sound like this, bitch





(Ok, well)
Till you grabbin on the clouds in the air
Well, till you grabbin' on the clouds in the air
Y'all gon' turn the lights on and be naked
