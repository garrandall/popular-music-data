(I bought a toothbrush)


I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place
Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
The billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all, I know I will


Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered


I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
Been wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside, empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish it would stop


Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered


I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do?


Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered


Oh, tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the truth of another
Tempted and the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
