Oh the night
Is slipping away
Femme jolie, femme jolie*
And there's still so much left to say
Femme jolie, femme jolie
Oh we haven't got time
'Cause I'll be gone in the sunshine
Oh my love
You've been good to me
Femme jolie, femme jolie
I could love you so easily
Femme jolie, femme jolie
Oh what can I do now?
Since I left you now
I've only
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
I need to know
Tonight

And the night is never to wait
Femme jolie, femme jolie
Love me now before it's too late
Femme jolie, femme jolie
Oh we haven't got time
I'll be gone in the sunshine
I've only
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
I need to know
Oh, Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on Sunday
I'm leavin' on Monday
Only got one day to love me, yeah
Sugar on...
