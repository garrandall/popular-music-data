Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
The real, real, real fine lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I didn't get a chance
To ask her to dance
It was love at first sight
I just saw her tonight
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I like the way she danced in the dark
And disappeared in the night
And oh she stole my heart
It was love at first sight

Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
I gotta meet that lady
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Who's that lady
That real fine lady
Who's that lady
That beautiful lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Say hey lady
I'm in love with you
