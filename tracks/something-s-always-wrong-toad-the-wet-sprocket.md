Another day, I call and never speak
And you would say nothing's changed at all
And I can't feel much hope for anything
If I won't be there to catch you if you fall


Again (We fail)
It seems we meet (To meet and mend)
In the spaces (Spaces safe)
In between (Between intents)
We always say (Say too much)
It won't be long (Long been gone)
Oh, but something's always wrong


Another game of putting things aside
As if we'll come back to them some time
A brace of hopes, a pride of innocents
And you would say something has gone wrong


Again (We fail)
It seems we meet (To make amends)
In the spaces (And wend our way)
In between (Between intent)
We always say (Looking back)
It won't be long (Not moving on)
Oh, but something's always wrong


Yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, hey


Again (We fail)
It seems we meet (To meet and mend)
In the spaces (Spaces safe)
In between (Between intent)
We always say (Say too much)
It won't be long (Long been gone)
Oh, but something's always wrong
Something's always wrong
Something's always wrong

Hey, hey, hey, hey
