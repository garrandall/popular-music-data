One step a time, boy
You're moving too fast, boy
One step a time, boy
You're moving too fast, boy

I'm the type of girl who
Likes to take it slow and easy
Please be kind, no matter
What you do, take your time

It doesn't pay to move too fast
Not if you want a love that will last

So, baby (don't push me)
Slow down (don't push me)
What's your hurry (don't push me)

Oh, you got to take it
One step at a time
Slow and easy
You're moving too fast

Rome wasn't built in a day
It took a lot of planning
So they say

Like Rome was built with care
Believe you've got to do the same
If you want me

It took a lot of time
To make this world
If you really want me
To be your girl

So, baby (don't push me)
Slow down (don't push me)
What's your hurry (don't push me)

Oh, you got to take it
One step at a time, boy
You're moving too fast
Slow down, slow down...
