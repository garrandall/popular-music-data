Amber cascades all over today
Then we walk on a crooked catwalk
Only to be delayed
Bubbles of blue burst into two
Eaten up by the incoming tide
Of the new

Then we call to the man who walks on the water
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view
It's in view

Granite charades are played in the rain
Till we fall through a sand castle window
To avoid the pain
Summer canoe paddles up to you
'Cause it's time for another beer run
Or something that's equally true

Then we call to the man who walks on the water
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view

Then we call to the man who walks on the water
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view
It's in view
