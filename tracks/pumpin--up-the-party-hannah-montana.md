Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now 

It's the same old, same grind
But we don't feel we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find a better way
My friends, my kind
No one's gettin' left behind
If they did it'd be a crime
That's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
No time to play it safe

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now 

They can't
We can
Parents might not understand
Having fun without a plan
But that's what we do
We're all here (Let's go!)
Gotta make this party grow
Together we can make it blow
Right through the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now 

We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise
Feel the thunder
It's time to lose control

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now 
Pumpin' up the party now
Party now, party now

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
