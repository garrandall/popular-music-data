I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
But none quite as lovely as you
More beautiful than the Mona Lisa
Worth more than gold
And my eyes have pleasure to behold


You're my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration


Things never looked clearer
Peace within never felt nearer
My burden's gone, it's turned into a song
Tender as a baby's touch
I needed you, oh, so much
At last, the load's so light


You're my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration


I plan to give you all that I have
I'll be everything
Everything you think I am
You make life a joy to live
And I'm thankful
Yes, I'm blessed just to know you


I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
But none quite as delectable as you
More beautiful than the Mona Lisa
Worth more than gold
And my eyes have the pleasure just to behold


You're my latest, tell you you're my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration
You inspire me, inspire me
Don't you know it, my latest, my greatest inspiration?


You just keep on liftin' me up, now
(Higher, higher)
You inspire me, I want you to keep on liftin' me up
(Higher, higher)
I want you to keep on liftin' me up
(Higher, higher)
Alright, see, you got me, you got me doin' things
(Higher)
I've never done before
(Higher)
See, you inspire me, you inspire me
Don't you know I love you, girl?
(Higher, higher)
You, you, you, you keep on liftin' me
(Higher, higher)
Higher, higher, higher, you, you
You keep on liftin' me, yeah
(Higher, higher)
Higher, oh now
(Higher)
You keep on liftin' me
(Higher)
You keep on liftin' me
You know what you do to me
Come on, keep on liftin' me
(Higher, higher)
Higher
