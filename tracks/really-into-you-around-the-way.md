Post my meaning

Here's an oldie but goodie

There's something bout the
Way you move that turns me on
Your sultry looks and boyish charms

Around the way is where
The boy that took my breath away

It seems to me, you want to be
The one to sweep me off my feet
You're so cute and, oh, so sweet, yeah

I'm really into you (oh, baby)
So what you been up to
(What you gonna do)
I'm really into you
So what you been up to
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm into you and all the things you do
So open up the doors to your heart
Oh, cause if I need to find love
I'll always thank the stars for you

The eye contact equal total submission
Ride with the rhythm cause
The rhythm is the motor
Cool with the rhyme when
The rhyme

Some people tell me
That I move too fast
That I should hold back
When dropping the jazz

But when I met you
It all fell through
I'm really into you, for real

I'm really into you (oh, baby)
So what you been up to
(What you gonna do)
I'm really into you
So what you been up to
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm into you and all the things you do
So let me find my way into your heart
Cause if I need to find love
I'll always thank the stars for you

If there's a time that you
Decide you want to find me
Seems to bring you down
You don't have to look too far
To see that I was right here
You don't have to be afraid
I'll always be around

It seems to me, you want to be
The one to sweep me off my feet
You're so cute and, oh, so sweet

I'm really into you (into you)
So what you been up to
(I need your loving)
I'm really into you
(I'm really into you)
So what you been up to

(Baby, baby, baby, yeah)
I'm really into you
(I'm really into you)
So what you been up to

Baby, can't you see
I'll make you into me
I'm into you
So what you gonna do, yeah

Tell me, girl
What's it gonna be
Is it gonna be me (yeah)
(It's gonna be you, oh, yeah)

I'm really into you
So what you gonna do
