Baby, you can come see me 'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of


It's been a while, and I'm sittin' here thinkin' of
How it felt when we first made love
Oh, I need that feelin' again
Nobody can compare, so


Come with me (and I'll go with you)
To this place that lovers dream of
(We can do) we can do anything, (sexy) sexy things
(And I'm here to let you know, baby)


You can come see me 'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of


It's been awhile, thinking about the last time I held you
And the smell of your sweet perfume, babe
The way I felt when you left my room
Oh, I wanna feel that way tonight


Come with me (come on)
And I'll go with you (oh)
To this place (to this place)
That lovers dream of (oh)
We can do (sexy) anything, sexy things
(And I'm here to let you know)


Baby, you can come see me 'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Baby, you can come see me 'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of


Now that bodysuit that you're wearing, girl, it fits you like paint
You think that I'ma sit here and pass this chance when I ain't?
I got some thoughts set on you and many things we can do
How many women in my life but, yet, I only love you
You're number one on my list, and I, I reminisce over our first kiss
And girlfriend, yo, picture this
Let's relight the candle, give this one more shot
I never meant to mistreat ya girl, I need you a lot


Baby, you can come see me 'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of


Baby, you can come see me (And I need you)
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free (I need you)
And I'll show you what love is made of
(Girl, let me show you)
Baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
