All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
No gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you.


Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over
There's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you (you)!


We're back
Hey hey I can't forget you baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to mascarate the pain
Thats why I'm next on the booth
D-d-d dance to the groove
There is no there is no getting over you.
Baby it feels so right
To dance to the beat up night
The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light
We like to live like class
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no, there is no getting over you.
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...


All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you.


Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over
There's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you (you)!


I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...


People in the place
If you ever felt love
Then you know what I'm talking about
There is no gettin' over
Ah


I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
