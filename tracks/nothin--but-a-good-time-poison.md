Nothin' but a good fuckin' day, rock it
Now listen

Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I wanna do my girl
Right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always workin', slavin' everyday
Gotta get a break from same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
You can hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better
Oh I feel get better and

Spend my money on women and wine
I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
Really sorry about the shape I'm in
Just like my fun, every now and then

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
You can hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better
All you do to me, oh look it down

You see I raise a toast to all of us
You're busting your ass every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away, here's to ya

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better, sing it

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better
