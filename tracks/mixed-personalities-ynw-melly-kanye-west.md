Because I am hard, you will not like me


Say you want someone
Say you want someone
Said you want someone
(Say you want someone)


I think I got mixed personalities
This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she mad at me


Say you want someone that'll love you
Someone who could please you
Someone who can kiss on and rub you
Fuck you like this, fuck you like that


Oh, now, I got mixed personalities
She got me stressin', singin' melodies
For her, I swear I'd catch a felony
(Oh, Penelope)

Say you want someone
Say you want someone
Said you want someone
(Said you want someone)


I swear to God, this girl be trippin', dawg
One day she Blooded, then she Crippin', dawg
You know I put it in her kidneys, dawg
She screamin' out, she need some Lithanol
She blockin', ignorin' my calls (Blockin', ignorin' my calls)
She keep on blockin', ignorin' my calls (Blockin', ignorin' my calls)
I'm all inside her, I'll knock down her walls (Knock 'em down, boom)
This bitch is hyper, need some Adderall (Oh, no)


I think I got mixed personalities
This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she's mad at me


Say you want someone that'll love you
Someone who could please you
Someone who can kiss on and rub you
Fuck you like this, fuck you like that

Oh, Lord, I ain't never been here before, oh, no
Oh, keep pressin' ignore, oh, no
She keep ignorin' my calls and blockin' me on everything
Bitch, oh, no
Oh, and it's my fault, mmm
I got the keys to the lil' bitch heart and you can't get the vault (Yeah)
Better go get a locksmith, better go get your Glock, bitch
Pull up on a mothafuckin' opp if he playin' with my Slime
That's my boo, that's my Slime, that's my everything (Everything)
That's my bitch forever, don't need no wedding ring (No wedding ring)
I'll give her the world, polka dots on her new pajamas
Take the bitch out to Bahamas, let the ho eat at Benihana (Benihana)
Matter of fact, ain't tryna meet your mama (Meet her mama)
Dick her down, that the other way (All the way)
Dick her down, yeah, the other way (Right way)
Dick her down, yeah, the Thugger way (Thugger way)
Knockin' on your door (Door), tryna give your love (Love, love)
You keep tellin' me (Love), you don't give a fuck (Fuck, fuck)

You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, bae
You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, bae
You won't find nobody that can fuck you like I fuck you, bae
Young Nigga World and I got them Young Nigga Ways


I think I got mixed personalities
This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she mad at me

Say you want someone
Say you want someone
Said you want someone
(Said you want someone)
