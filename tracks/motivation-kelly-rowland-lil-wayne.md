Go, go, go, go


Turn the lights off


Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make mama proud


Turn the lights off


And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Baby I'mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go


Uh, girl girl I turn that thing into a rain forest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh but I go deeper
Make make you lose yourself, and finders keepers

It go green light, go go go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes

She my motivation
I'm her transportation
'Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy

Then I just keep going going like I'm racing
When I'm done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby


But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Oh lover,
When you call my name
No other,
Can do that the same
I won't let ya get up out of the game, no
So go lover,
Gon' and make me rain

And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

Baby I'mma be your motivation
