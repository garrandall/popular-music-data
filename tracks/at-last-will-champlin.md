Well, you set off on a road trip and you thought it would be really fun
(Thought thought thought it'd be fun)


Cruisin' down the highway in the bright California sun
(Sun fun, fun in the sun)


But something feels off, something's not quite right


And now you're hoping that the end's in sight
Because you're


Trapped in a car with someone you don't want to be trapped in a car with
(Trapped, trapped, trapped in a car)


Now this person's eating corn chips, where did those come from?
(From from, where'd the corn chips come from?)


It's hard to focus on a podcast because they've started to hum
(Hum hum, I will rip off your mouth)


We pass a mini-golf course and they go, "Ooooh!"


Just when you think it's getting better, they take off their shoes
Because you're


Trapped in a car with someone you don't want to be trapped in a car with
(Oh God, your toes, do they have a disease?)
Trapped in a car with someone you don't want to be trapped in a car with
(They smell so bad, see a doctor, please.)

And the car ride is so endless
It feels like so much time has passed
That your taste evolves, and you enter a more experimental era of your music career
Why do we even have cars at all?
In the scheme of things, this Earth is small
Or do I really need to travel somewhere
Or can I get there in my mind?
I could leave everyone else behind
Like him and her and her


Alhambra, Glendora
La Puente, here's some more-a
Covina, Pasadena
Baby, have you seen her?


Oh no! The car ride has gone on so long
That we're now in the later, more commercial stages of our career
Because we're trapped in a car with someone I don't want to be trapped in a car with


Ontario, Alhambra
We already said Alhambra


Trapped in a car with someone we don't want to be trapped in a car with


PiÃ±a colada
That should be a city


Trapped in a car with someone we don't want to be trapped in a car with


Trapped, trapped, trapped in our song


Trapped in a car with someone I don't want to be trapped in a car with


Trapped, trapped, trapped in a car
