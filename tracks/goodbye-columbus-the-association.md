Got to say hello
It's a lucky day
Kiss the moon goodbye
And be on our way

It's a lucky day
Cause I found you
Gonna build a
New world around you
Touch the sun and run
It's a lucky day

Hello life
Goodbye Columbus
I've got a feeling that
You're gonna hear from us
You're gonna know
That we've taken
The world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day

Just for changing
Leaving the old world behind
Lucky day for walking a new road
Just to clear your mind

It's a day for starting a new way
Telling the old one goodbye
Lucky day for getting above it
Spread your wings and fly

Hello life
Goodbye Columbus
I've got a feeling that
You're gonna hear from us
You're gonna know
That we've taken
The world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day

Hello life
Goodbye Columbus
I've got a feeling that
You're gonna hear from us
You're gonna know
That we've taken
The world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day

Yeah, yeah...
Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
Goodbye, goodbye Columbus...
