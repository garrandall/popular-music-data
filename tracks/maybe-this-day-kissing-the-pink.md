Maybe this day will be the happy day, when all my hopes will turn out right

Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl who'll come back with me tonight, tonight, tonight

Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl, or it will end in tears

Maybe she'll take me home, or make me run. She was bound to win

She said "oh", "Oh" ,"Oh" Maybe this girl will dance with me "Oh"

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight

May be this day will be the happy day, when all my hopes will turn out right

Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl who'll come back with me tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight a lucky star will shine

Tonight

Over the garden wall, she'll say "Let's go to bed"

"oh", "Oh" ,"Oh" Maybe this girl will dance with me "Oh" "oh" "Oh"

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight

Maybe this girl will dance with me

Maybe this girl will...
