Fool
If she thinks that she, can take you from me...
She got to be a Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...
Foolish...Foooolish...Fool

She's crazy...crazy...crazy...crazy, craaaazy... girl
If she thinks that she, can destroy my world. She got to be a crazy...crazy...crazy...crazy...crazy... crazy...craaazy girl

My love for you, is too stroong...
We been together for Oh too long..
I told my Mother... and Father too
I'd give them both up, before I lose you

She got to be Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...
Foooolish...Fool

If she thinks that she, can take you from me
She's got to be Crazy...Crazy...Crazy...Crazy...
Crazy...Craaazy Girl

I told my Mother... my Father too..
I'd give them both up...I'd give them both up
Before I lose you...
She's got to be Crazy...
My, My she's Foolish...
She's Crazy...Crazy...Crazy...Crazy...
Foolish...Foolish...Foolish...Foolish..
She's a Fool to think that she can take you from me...
She's got to be Crazy...Crazy...
My...My...My..
