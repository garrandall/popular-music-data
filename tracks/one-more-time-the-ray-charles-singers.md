One more time
Please let me hold you
One more time

Before you walk away, my dear
Please let me hold you near
I love you, dear

So let me kiss you
One more time
Please let me kiss you
One more time

I know I'm gonna miss you so
My darling, when you go
I'll miss you so

So let me stay, my dear
For just another moment or two
Then I'll have
The memory of you
To see me though

So let me hold you
One more time
And let me kiss you
One more time

That's all I'll ever ask of you
Unless you say that you
Still love me too

For maybe one more time
Is all I need
Just one more time
And maybe you will see
That I'm your one and only love

Let me stay for
Just another moment
A moment, a moment or two

Then I'll have
The memory of you
To see me through
To see me through
To see me through

So let me hold you
One more time
And let me kiss you
One more time

That's all I'll ever ask of you
Unless you say that you
Still love me too

For maybe one more time
Is all I need
Just one more time
And maybe you will see that
I'm your one and only love

Your one and only love
Your one and only love
One more time
