Woo, Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lips, lips, lips (Muah)
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lips, lips, lips


I ain't afraid to drown, if that means I'm deep up in your ocean, yeah
Girl I'll drink you down, sipping on your body all night
I just wanna take your legs and wrap them round
Girl you cummin' right now
My head to your chest feeling your heartbeat, girl
Swimming all in your sea
And you sweatin' all over me
Bring it forward, don't you run, run
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm
Rainin' on me girl, you're soakin' wet

Ooooo, whoaaaaaaa


I'm a kiss it right, yea, yeah
I'm gon lick all night, yea, yeah
Girl, when I'm inside yea, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
Girl I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm a put your legs behind your head
When I make you wet the bed


You don't know what you in for
Bout to get inside your mental, huh
Bend your back like it's limbo
I'm a make you feel like a Nympho
Tonight (ohou're mine, baby girl, uhhhh

Anytime you want it
I'm ready and willin' gotta give it
I start to lick on your body
You go to trembling
Flip it around girl, let me get it from the side
And can I visit all those spots you like
Your neck, your back, your sexy lips
Booty and thighs

I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm
Rainin' on me girl, you're soakin' wet
Yea, yeah


I'm a kiss it right, yea, yeah
I'm gon lick all night, yea, yeah
Girl, when I'm inside yea, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
Girl I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm a put your legs behind your head
When I make you wet the bed


I'm a make your body wetter than ever
We'll get together you could tell as soon as I approach her
When you feelin' uptight get it right
Don't fight, lightin up like Sammy Sosa
Women call me the super soaker
And I'm a soak your bed to death
(Don't stop, huh, huh)
How long can you hold you breath, uhh
A-a-asthma attackin'
Waking up, wondering what happened
Makin' me high like Toni Braxton
You can't deny you wanna break my back in, two
What you wanna do, look at you with your birthday suit, suit, suit, suit
The forecast said it's cloudy tonight
And I'm a have your body like bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop


I'm a kiss it right, yea, yeah
I'm gon lick all night, yea, yeah
Girl, when I'm inside yea, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
Girl I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed
Bed, bed
I'm a put your legs behind your head
When I make you wet the bed


Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lips, lips, lips
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lips, lips, lips
