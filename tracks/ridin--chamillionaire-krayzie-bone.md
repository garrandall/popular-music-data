They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty


Police think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell,
I'm gripping oak
Music loud and I'm tipping slow
Twin's steady twisting like hit this dough
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution
CD changes niggas like, "Who is that producing?"
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruising
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losing

They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty


I been drinking and smoking
Holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big old Excursion swerving
All up in the curbing
Nigga be sipping on the Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand,
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo
I gotta get the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark,
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty


Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sure, 'cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling them, "We hate you."
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, finding a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm 'bout to pull up at your home and it's on


They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
