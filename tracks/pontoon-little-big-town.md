Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiin'?
Floatin' is all I wanna do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque


On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmmm...motorboatin'

(Hoo hoo hoo)

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube


Pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmm...motorboatin'

(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)


5 mile an hour with aluminum side
Wood panelin' with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride


On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
I'm out here in the open
Mmmmmmm...motorboatin'

On the pontoon

(Hoo hoo hoo)

On the pontoon

(Hoo hoo hoo)

Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon

(Hoo hoo hoo)

(Hoo hoo hoo)
