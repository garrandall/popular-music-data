Don't you believe that I want you?
I need you here in my arms.
Although you won't have to worry

I'll spend each day in your charms.
I wanna kiss you all over

Running my hands through your hair

I know a place where love is

I'll keep you warm
Night and day.
In the love zone - you don't have to be alone

Together we can live and learn - in the love zone.

Come rest your head on my shoulder

And we'll count the stars in the night

I wanna feel you beside me
Oh
Just holding you tight.
I wanna give you little tenderness

Letting you know that you're loved

I wanna hold you close to me to keep you warm night and day.
In the love zone - you don't have to be alone

Together we can live and learn - in the love zone.

Oh baby
Don't you know

I do the best I can to be good for you.
But when love's a guarantee there is no mystery

You'll never be a stranger out there on your own -
In the love zone.

Your love made the difference in my life

You'll never be alone.
Love zone - you don't have to be alone

Together we can live and learn - in the love zone.
Love zone - I keep your warm - love zone - night and day -
Love zone - come rest your head on my shoulder - love zone -
We can count the stars every night - live and learn.
