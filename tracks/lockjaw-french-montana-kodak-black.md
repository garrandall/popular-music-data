My nigga, my go-to
You never told me
Montana


It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'


I'll chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly-ed up
I be tryna change my life, but the monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
Skrrt, skrrt, all about the mula ('Bout the mula)
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off (Bling)
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God (Pray to God)
Soon as the floor hit my feet, I'm getting high (Gettin' high)
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah, bitch, I'm 1K, and I'ma keep it one hundo
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off


It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'


Slidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi
And I'm pourin' up the brown, damn, I'm sippin' on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny-'enny
Pull up to the back, black Zack 'chief rockin'
And the feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the 49ers
Bite down, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
Fifty chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly
Nah, baby, I don't want the Wap, I just want the fetty


It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'


Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Skrrt, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Ayy, ayy, ayy
