My nigga on the road
You never told me, Montana!


It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'


Slept on a bunk for 20 months for selling jacks to junk
Fuck in the trunk or the dunk, I'm in caught playing Tunk
Troll blows and truck stops, bow loaded and bow walk
This the home of Coca Cola we call it the trap spot
I'm tryna to stay sucker free, I ain't fuckin' with blow pops
I keep runnin' like South, fear the feds, not patrol cops
I feel the feds like patrol cars
Had to shower in my boots, I had sleep in my shoes
I had a snitch in the trunk like he Rae Carruth
My ex chick drove a Acura
My plug drove a Maxima
Took the gold off my teeth and put the gold in my {Axima?}
I blow white like my Audemar
And the jaws keep locking cause she only keep sucking superstars
(GUCCI!)


It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

Slide in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket but I used to want to a Hemi
And I'm pouring up the round then I'm sippin on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny
Pull up to the back, black zac
Chief rockin'
And the Feds keep lurkin' cause the boys keep talkin'Ritz Carlton
Ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the 49ers
Bite downnnn, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doing 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on, diamonds flashing like Kodak
I remember toting.38, now I got a semi
Could have been, had a baby K
But I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack
Thought I went to Kelly
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

Ay, ay ay, ay, ay ay ay, skrr, ay, ay ay ay, ay, ay ay
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Ay, ay ay ay
