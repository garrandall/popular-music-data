It's been a while
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
But I'm here now

I know it's been a while
But I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout
How you say my name
You got my body spinning
Like a hurricane
And it feels like
You got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So let me get it up

Oh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared
We're grown now
I'm a hit defrost on you
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you
But you're frozen
That's what I'm saying

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel

So are you warming up yet?

You got me hypnotised
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting
Cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough
So let me get it up

Oh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared
We're grown now
I'm a hit defrost on you
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you
But you're frozen
That's what I'm saying

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel

I like this part
It feels kinda good
Yeah

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Hot (more)
