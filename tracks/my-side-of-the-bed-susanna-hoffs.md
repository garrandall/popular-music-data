I want to show you the picture I drew
When I was on the phone talking to you
I made a heart and I colored it red
'Cause I want you here
On my side of the bed

Oh woe, oh woe
Oh woe, oh woe

I've been dreaming since I was born
And in my dreams I see eyes like yours
I'll be the pillow where you lay your head, lay your head
If you'll come and sleep
On my side of the bed

Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down

Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down

I know you hurt, I feel the pain
Take my hand and come out of the rain
We all need to be comforted
You can get yours
On my side of the bed

On my side of the bed

Lay down on my side of the bed
Come lay down

Tra-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Lay down (ooh ooh ooh ooh) lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la (I made a heart)
Sha-la-la-la-la (I colored it red)
Lay down (I colored it red) lay down

Sha-la-la-la-la (lay down)
Sha-la-la-la-la (lay down)
Lay down (ooh ooh ooh ooh) lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la (oooh)
Sha-la-la-la-la (oooh)
Lay down (ooh ooh ooooh) lay down

Sha-la-la-la-la (I made a heart)
Sha-la-la-la-la (I colored it red)
Lay down (I colored it red) lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la (lay down)
Sha-la-la-la-la (lay down)
Lay down, lay down (on my side of the bed)
