Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to gain and hard to hold
Like a rose that's so soft to touch
Love has gone that can hurt so much

Well and why?
Must the same love that made me laugh
Have to make me cry?

Well you think of love as sittin' on a mountain
Think of it as bein' a great big rock
Why don't you think before you started to roll it down?
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, I don't want to live

Oh, you think of love as sittin' on a mountain
Think of it as bein' a great big rock
Why don't you think before you started to roll it down?
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, I don't want to live

Well and why?
Must the same love that made me laugh
Have to make me cry?
Oh now why?
Must the same love that made me laugh
Why you wanna make me cry?

Why you wanna make me cry?
Tell me now
