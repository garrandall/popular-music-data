Your love is like a a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, and hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone, and it hurts so much


Well and why…
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?


Well now, you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop


I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live


Well and Why…
Must the same love that made me laugh
Why you wanna make me cry?


Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
And just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me mess u my pillow?
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
