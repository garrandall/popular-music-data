Let the spirit flow all through your body
Just lend us an ear
Involve yourself
You're free to follow
And we'll take you there


You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights


Just say you will
Just do what you feel
I'm for real


The music`s full of joy and laughter
And it's such a thrill
To free your mind from all the pressure
Head on up the hill


You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights


Rock freak
Rock freak
Rock freak
Rock freak


Don't say you will
Just do what you feel
I'm for real


The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights


Just dancing with my baby one time
Feels good all over
It's good, the feeling's good
About me and-me and baby
Disco
