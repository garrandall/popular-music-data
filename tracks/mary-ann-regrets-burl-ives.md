I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I received this short little note
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me, but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann

The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann

My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary-Ann
