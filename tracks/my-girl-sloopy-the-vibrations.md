Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause you know, Sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And so I sing out
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy wears a red dress, yeah, as old as the hills (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But when Sloopy wears that red dress, yeah, you know, it gives me the chills, oh, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, when I see you walking, walking down the street (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I say, "don't worry, Sloopy, girl, you belong to me" (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And so I sing out
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em right now

Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me, yeah, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)

Well, it feels so good (come on, come on)
You know, it feels so good (come on, come on)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, yeah (come on, come on)
Oh

Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
