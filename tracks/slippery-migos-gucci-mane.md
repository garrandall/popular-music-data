She want a dose of me (dose)
Just hop in the Ghost with me (Ghost)
Perky and molly, don't vote for nobody
These bitch ass niggas ain't solid (solid)

Cars robotic, bad bitch with a body
But really don't care nothing about it (uh-uh)

I rock water, diamonds, I'm drippin' but not slippin'
I threw a quarter, well, damn, but no I'm not trippin'
Bugatti on Forgis, and nawl, I'm not crippin'
I buy Ferraris like Jordans
I'm Mike and y'all Pippen
Chillin', just me and my millions
Niggas, they all in they feelin's
My bitches, I spoil them like they chillens
So persistent, if I want it, I go get it
I'm so slimy, grimy, shiesty but still shining
Rude and unkindly, cruel with no conscience
Drop the top on College, nigga I ain't with no nonsense
And I'm a murderer nigga but I don't promote violence

They don't know I see the plot (see it)
Fuck it I seize a knot

Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
I heard your bitch she got that water
