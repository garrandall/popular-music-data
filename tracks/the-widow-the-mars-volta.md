I've always wanted 
To eat glass with you again 
But I never knew how 
How to talk without 
Walls dropping on the eve 
The nest they made couldn't break you 
Along the fallen 
Scowled a fence of beaks 
But the temple is scathing 
Through your veins 
They were scaling 
Through an ice pick of abscess reckoning 

And when Miranda sang 
Everyone turned away 
Used to the noose they obey 

And whoever said that they would scatter 
Separating the mother from child 
She can bat a broken eyelid 
Raining maggots from its sty 
And with the traces that she leaves 
She will skin you out alive 

All the children go grinding their jaws 
The sweet smell of their toothless canals 
And the dam she will break, 
Make an ocean from this lake 
As they siphon off all our blood 

And when Miranda sang 
Everyone turned away 
Used to the noose they obey

And when Miranda sang 
Everyone turned away 
Used to the noose they obey

And when Miranda sang 
Everyone turned away 
Used to the noose they obey



I think I've become like one of the others 
I think I've become like one of the others 
I think I've become like one of the others 

There was a frail syrup dripping off 
His lap danced lapel, punctuated by her 
Decrepit prowl she washed down the hatching 
Gizzard soft as a mane of needles 
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged 
By combing her torso to a pile 
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse 
She was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels 

Bring me to my knees 
Read the sharpened lines 
All my arms, 
Bled me blind 
Faucet leaks in shadows 
Spilling from morgue lancet 
Caressed your fontanelle 
I've sworn to kill every last one 
Every last one 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms 
Onto the floor 
And out of your mouth 
Out of your eyelids 

No there's no light, in the darkest 
Of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, in the darkest 
Of your furthest reaches 

All your dreams, splintered off 
Leech by leech on this catafalque 
Anyone will tell you, yes anyone 
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm 
Your mother flirted with disease 
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms, onto the floor 
And out of your mouth 
And out of your eyelids 

No there's no light, in the darkest 
Of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, in the darkest 
Of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, in the darkest 
Of your furthest reaches 

Shock lest shackles free you 
Volt face cons 
abandon you again 
I won't feel not this time 

Shock lest shackles free you 
Volt face cons 
abandon you again 
I won't feel not this time



Brick by brick, the night eclipsed 
Pricked by cuticle thorns 
Dried the sleep on nursery slits 
Into this life I'm born 
Heaven's just a scab away 
I'd like to see you after just one taste 

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, 
Let them see it has begun 
The others I've become 

If you should see the dice, 
Charmed with its snaked choked eyes 
You'll wear the widows weeds 
Because they're just your size 
Behind the snail secretion, 
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs 
A limbless procreation, 
Let the infant crawled deformed 
A bag replaced the breath of these suffocating sheets 
And now when the craving calls 
I'll scratch my itchy teeth 

Come on and sing it now...

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight, 
Night forever more 
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight, 
Night forever more 

She fell for the whispers, 
Sister flooded deaf tears 
That night tore a river, 
In her baron womb mirror 
And his multiple sons with their mandible tongues 
Set crucified fires to petrified homes...
Let it burn 

And the owls they were watching 
And the owls didn't care 
Then the owls came a knocking, 
Placenta in their stares 
They will feed on all the carnage, 
Leftover from the flood 
And in the corner of their eyes, 
Fled sister L' Via 
Sister L' Via 

Now the pieces went floating, 
Reflecting all at dusk 
Conceived from the stabbing, 
was Vismund Cygnus 

Twenty five wives in the lake tonight...



Twenty five wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine 
Twenty five snakes pour out your eyes 
Yeah the icepicks cumming on the marble shrine 
Twenty five snakes are drowning
