Forever and always
When I die I keep on living for you

You give me strength when I start to worry
You lift me up when I'm feeling sorry
You're building me up with love & affection
When I'm in danger you're my protection

And I'm the one you can depend upon
I'll always treat you right, never do you wrong
Just feel the love burning inside of me
It's gonna last for eternity
For eternity

For eternity
Cause baby I love you
Oh
Baby I need you
Yes, I do

And when I die I keep on living
You'll always have my love seeing you through
I'll be your angel up in heaven
Forever all my love will shine on you
Cause baby I love you
Oh
Baby I need you
Yes, I do

Hey

Are you that someone you can believe in?
No one can take away what we're feeling
Our love is strong, it goes on forever
No one will ever love you better

And when they moan I'll still be true to you
The seed of love lives inside of you
I'll be your angel up in heaven
And all my love will shine down on you
For eternity

For eternity
Cause baby I love you
Oh
Baby I need you
Yes, I do

And when I die I keep on living
You'll always have my love seeing you through
I'll be your angel up in heaven
Forever all my love will shine on you
Cause baby I love you
Oh
Baby I need you
Yes, I do

And when I die I keep on living
You'll always have my love seeing you through - seeing you through
I'll be your angel up in heaven - up in heaven
Forever all my love will shine on you
Baby I love you
Oh
Baby I need you
Yes, I do
