Well, he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy
To ever let him get away
But, girl, you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me
For what I'm 'bout to say
Big Deal, so what , who cares
You just got lucky, that's all
It was, shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candle light, and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what, big deal.
He's perfect, I heard ya
The first ten times that you told me
(Yeah, Yeah) It's amazin', his lovin'
I can't believe I let him go
I regret it, there I said it
You call yourself a friend
But you just keep rubbin' it in
Big Deal, so what , who cares
You just got lucky, that's all
It was, I swear
If I hear another word about
Candle light, and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what, big deal.
Congratulations, I'm just
So happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel
Big Deal, Big Deal
So what , who cares
You just got lucky, that's all
It was, shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candle light, and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what, big deal.
In love, so what
Big Deal,
Big Deal,
Oh, yeah!
Big Deal.
