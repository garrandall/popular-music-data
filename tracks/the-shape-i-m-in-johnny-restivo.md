I can't go, I can't stay
It's your fault, I'm this way
I ain't ever been, hmm, the shape I'm in
I can't sit, I can't stand
This feeling is so grand
Hoping it never ends, hmm, the shape I'm in
You tell me no, then you tell me yes
You keep my mind a wreck
I'm not gonna ever rest, I'm gonna get you yeah
I feel good, I feel bad
I feel happy, I feel sad
But I love you all over again
I love being in the shape I'm in
Yeah!

Can't go, I can't stay
It's your fault, I'm this way
I ain't ever been, hmm, the shape I'm in
I can't sit, I can't stand
This feeling is so grand
Hoping it never ends, hmm, the shape I'm in
You tell me no, then you tell me yes
You keep my mind a wreck
I'm not gonna ever rest, I'm gonna get you yeah
I feel good, I feel bad
I feel happy, I feel sad
But I love you all over again
I love being in the shape I'm in
Yeah!
