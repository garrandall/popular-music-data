We're on the right track
We're  on the right track now

Both  you and I have done things that we learned to regret
You know love is the way that we want to forgive and forget
Now we've found the right direction
We've  found love and affection
I  bet you selection
Why don't you stay under my protection

We're  on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now

Love  sent for me makes me feel like I dance to this song
You know you brought to me that love that we have is too strong
We could be a legend in our time
We make up for the rhyme
We could go down in history
As the greatest love of all time

We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now

Love sent for me makes me feel like I dance to this song
You know you brought to me that love that we have is too strong
We could be a legend in our time
We make up for the rhyme
We could go down in history
As the greatest love of all time

We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now

We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track (we're on the right track)
We're on the right track now
