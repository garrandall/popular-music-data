Now come on, baby
Let's do the switch-a-roo
(Switch-a-roo, switch-a-roo)
Come on, baby

There is nothing to it, honey
If I can do it, so can you
(Switch-a-roo, switch-a-roo)
Now, hey, hey, everybody
Let's get up on the hill
(Switch-a-roo, switch-a-roo)
Hey, everybody

(Switch-a-roo, switch-a-roo)
I know you think you won't now
Aw, but I know you will
(Switch-a-roo, switch-a-roo)
Come on, baby
Form a big boss line
Come on, baby
Don't you fall behind
That's it baby

Yougre doing the switch-a-roo

Form a big boss line
Come on, baby

Yougre doing the switch-a-roo
