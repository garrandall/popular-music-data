Thinkin' back on how we use to be.
Oh Oh
Your on my mind constantly,
Free your love come with me.
I wanna' give you everything (oh baby)
I wanna' give you everything (Yeah!)
Your on my mind constantly,
Free your love come with me. (free you love)
I wanna' give you everything
I wanna' give you everything

Thinkin' back on how, we use to be
In the past, I'm a wishin'
You'd always, stay the same
And it would last, baby your on my mind


Your on my mind constantly, (constantly)
Free your love come with me.
I wanna' give you everything
I wanna' give you everything
Your on my mind constantly,
Free your love come with me. (free your love)
I wanna' give you everything
I wanna' give you everything

What is the problem? I don't understand?
You used to tell me everything, cause' I was your man.
I put my trust in you, gave you all my time
Now you turn your back on me, I don't even know why? (no baby)

I gave you all of my time (ooh)
I had to make it right (make it right)
Everything I do, I wanna' share it all with you. (I wanna' share)
When I see your smiling face, your the one who makes my day.
Let me kiss you for a while, turn your frown into a smile.

On my mind constantly (constantly)
Free your love, I wanna' give you everything
Baby I can make you smile, your smile, your smile
Your on my mind, my mind, my mind, your on my mind



Baby I can make you smile again
Ya let me see you smile?
Baby I can make you smile again
Let me see you smile again-baby
