I can't say no) can't say no
(I can't say no)

You always say you're gonna stay
And then you leave me
This time, you've been gone
About a month or two

Now, you want me
So you bought me a little present
And tell, how can I say no to you

(I can't say no)
No, I can't say no
(I can't say no)

Your heart is mine on borrowed time
Just for the moment
I don't know why I put up
With the things you do

You adore me, then ignore me
Until the next time
And, baby, still I can't say no to you

(I can't say no)
No, I can't say no, no, no
(I can't say no)

I wish that you would stay away
Give me a chance to get stronger
But you come around now and then
Gets to the point where
I can't hold out any longer

I ask you to stay
You just smile and leave me lonely
And sure enough
My teardrops come right on cue

Oh, if I could find the peace of mind
When I won't love you
I'd make the try but how can I
Say no to you

(I can't say no)
No, I can't say no
(I can't say no)
No, I can't say no to you

(I can't say no)
No, I can't say no. no, no...
