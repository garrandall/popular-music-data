All through the night, I'll be awake and I'll be with you.
All through the night, this precious time, when time is new.
All, all through the night today, knowing that we feel
the same, without saying, the same without saying

We have no past we won't reach back,
Keep with me forward all through the night
and once we start a meter clicks,
and it goes running all through the night.
Until it ends, there is no end.

All through the night a stray cat is crying, stray cat sings back.
All through the night, they have forgotten what by they do lack.
Under those white street lamps, there is a little chance they may see you, a chance they may see you.

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night,
And once we start, the meter clicks,
it goes running all through the night.

Until it ends there is no end, keep with me forward all through the night and once we start,
the meter clicks, and goes running all through the night.
Until it ends, there is no end, keep with me forward all through the night.
Keep with me all through the night.
