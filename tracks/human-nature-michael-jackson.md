Looking out
Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
(Do you really like me to be around?)
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

That way (The way it was.)
That way (The way it was.)

Looking out
Across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Oh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

If they say, "Why? Why?"

Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Oh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

And they say, "Why? Why?"
Oh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

They say, "Why? Why?"
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Why, why does he do it that way?
I like livin' this way

The way
The way
