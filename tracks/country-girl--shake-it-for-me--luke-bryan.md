Hey girl. Go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love

Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
That got it in her blood to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile

So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big old barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Guitar!

Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yeah
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes

All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Oh, country girl
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
