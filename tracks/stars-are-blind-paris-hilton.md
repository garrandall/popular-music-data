I don't mind spending some time
Just hanging here with you
'Cause I don't find too many guys
That treat me like you do.
Those other guys all wanna take me for a ride
But when I walk they talk of suicide
Some people never get beyond their stupid pride
But you can see the real me inside
And I'm satisfied, oh no, ohh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Ohh, ohh, ohh

I could be your confidante
Just one of your girlfriends
But I know that's not what you want
If tomorrow the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me who have you been dreaming of?
I and I alone, oh, no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Baby I'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling
This moment is critical
Might be we feel it
It could get physical, oh no, no, no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Oh
Let's see what love can do (Oh)
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Maybe I'm perfect for you (Oh)
You (Oh)
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Even though the gods are crazy (Oh)

Even though the stars are blind (Oh)

Even though the gods are crazy (Oh)

Even though the stars are blind (Oh)
