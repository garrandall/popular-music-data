I look back on all those good times
We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who loved me better than you
Well it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes,
I've tried every love I could find,
Still I can't get you out of my mind

Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world is gonna move me,
No one in the world
Can love me like you do baby
Every time I'm with someone
Loving you yes I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again
No one in the world (no one in the world)
Loves me like you do

Are you happy now with your life
Well for me, I'm breaking inside
So self assured that I could not see
I had it all when you were with Me baby

No one in the world is gonna hold me
No one in the world can move me
No one in the world can love me like you do baby
Every time I'm with someone
Loving you and I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again
And no one in the world (no one in the world)
Loves me like you do

Please take me back (please take me back)
Oh babe, I can't go on (I can't go on)
I'm not happy in my life without you
I'll do whatever it takes
I've got to get you back with me again (get you back with me)
I realize, I need you here in my life

No one in the world (no one)
No one in the world (no body loves me like you)
No one in the world, (like, like, like you do baby)
You got the love I need
Everyone found the love that I need

And no one in the world (no one in the world)
In this world (ah, oo)
In this world (ah, oo, oo)
No one in the world
