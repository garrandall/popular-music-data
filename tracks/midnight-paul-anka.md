I'm so young and you're so old
This my darling I've been told
I don't care just what they say
'Cause forever I will pray

You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Oh please, stay by me Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close
Oh my darling, you're the most I love you
But do you love me
Oh Diana, can' t you see

I love you with all my heart
And I hope we'll never part
Oh please stay with me Diana

Oh my darling, oh my lover
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Only you can take my heart
Only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms

Hold me darling, ho, ho hold me tight
Squeeze me baby with all your mind
Oh please stay by me Diana
Oh Diana, oh please Diana
