I want somebody
To hear my cry
Ohhhh yeah
Ohhh yeahheahhh
I got home today
Back from my job
Walked in the door, yeah
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes
My baby's standing there
With a ticket in her hand
She said I'm leaving darling
I'm leaving 'cause I've got another man
Let me tell you I
(I've got trouble)
Trouble in my home
(In my home)
Ohhh, I've got trouble in my home
My?
Ain't got nothing
And the only woman I ever loved
Woah, she done turned her back on me
Baby, I realized
I realize I haven't always been?
But if you forgive me
Oh honey, I swear I'll make it up to you
Let me tell you, I've
(I've got trouble)

Trouble in my home
(In my home)
I tell ya, I feel it, I feel it
I got trouble in my home
Somebody pray for me
(Trouble in my home)
Pray that my woman
(Trouble in my home)
Will be at home in lovin' peace
I don't know what to do
I need someone to talk to
I really need someone, yeah
Somebody please
(Trouble in my home)
Somebody please hear my cry
(Trouble in my home)
I'm havin' so much bad luck
I tell ya I don't even know the reason why
Now my lovin' is gone
Seem like I'm all alone
I got trouble in my home
Trouble in my home
Somebody pray for me
