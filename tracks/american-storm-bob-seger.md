Headin' out on some uncharted path
You soon turn back
It happens time and time again
You never seem to reach the end
Someone's out there on the street tonight
When things go wrong
He'll guarantee to make them right
If the price is right

Every time I look you're fallin' fallin'
Beaten by the wind
Every time I turn around he's there again

It's like a full force gale
An American storm
You're buried far beneath a mountain of cold
And you never get warm
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge `em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You never feel the need

Everybody casts a certain light
A special gift
It's theirs to use for wrong or right
When you face the night
More and more we choose the easy way
We take no risks
We figure out which games to play
And how to make 'em pay

Suddenly the pressure's fallin' fallin'
Skies have all turned grey
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way

It's like a full force gale
Atop a mountain of cold
You tell your story again and again
And it never gets old
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You face a full force gale
An American storm
You're buried beneath a mountain of cold
And you never get warm - no you never get warm
You face a wall of mirrors
You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You never feel the need
