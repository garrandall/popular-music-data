Fuck them boys, they always 'ginners
Polished sheen and rag denim

And she said all her friends fake, was solo rocking
And she a real bad bad bitch, she ain't gotta Photoshop it

Uh, no limit
I C-Murder that, no limit, baby
Give you that ghetto D girl, no limit
Just know when you roll with a nigga like me
There's no limit, baby
