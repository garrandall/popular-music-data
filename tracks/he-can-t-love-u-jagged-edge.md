Ahhh.. This is amazing.. 
I gotta let u know, 
It's 2010.. 
And we bout to.. Slip-n-slide 
Jagged Edge, Trina.. Gucci! 
Now, are you ready? 


She stay on the tip of my tongue, my tongue, my tongue 
(on the tip of my, on the tip of my, on the tip of my) 

She stay on the tip of my tongue, my tongue, my tongue, 
(on the tip of my, on the tip of my, on the tip of my) 

She stay on the top of my mind, my mind, 
like all the time, 
(on the top of my, on the top of my, on the top of my) 

She stay on the top of my tongue, my tongue, my tongue 
(on the tip of my, on the tip of my, on the tip of my) 

She stay on the tip of my, 


Never leave my mind for a moment, for a moment girl 
No that aint no line, 
In a second she be walkin' back in lookin' extra good, and always oh so flyyyyy, 
You got that fire and im about give it to you, (Ooh, ooh, ooh... Its so good) 
Im about give it to you, yeah 

Here in the moments in love, 
We both hide, and hide, and hide... 




He aint gotta pay for it cuz he know its all his, 
4 with a bad squad, 
All our bags match our heels, 
I'm swag surfin' baby 
I got too much to feel, 
Its so sweet in my Vickie's, 
He cant believe its real, 
He like em red bone, 
He love em Independent, 
He call me work-a-holic, when he get the business 
Im like a marathon, 
Go hard from start to finish, 
Up-n-down, in-n-out, 
I'm on the tip of his tongue. 




Even when Im out with my homies, Im anxious like Ginuwine, 
Buzzin' like when Im high, 
Studyin' you all da time, 
I got a taste for like a vintage wine 
Give me the fever, she's cold as hail winter time 
Workin' hard like a 9 to 5, she's the only the thing on my mind, on my mind, on my mind, on my mind... 
On my mind, on my mind, all da time..... 


It's Gucci! 
Girl you spend one night with me baby, I bet you wont to leave 
Red shoppin' and red roses and them Burr, Burr, 
Got a crib it's so big girl, its a sight to see... 
You spend one night with me baby, bet you wont wanna to leave 
Im Gucci Mane La Flare, Im so far from these wanna b's, 
Right now Im so far away from you 
Near you wanna be, 
Everytime I kick it with you I dont wanna leave, 
Her sex so good, so good
Damn I dont wanna leave.. Its Gucci! 


Tonight, she's on the tip of my... 
Wingo: (tip of my tongue) 
Tonight, she's on the tip of my... 
(She stay on the top of my tongue, my tongue, my tongue) 
Tonight, she's on the tip of my... 
(She stay on the top of my tongue, my tongue, my tongue) 
Tonight, she's on the tip of my... 

Out
