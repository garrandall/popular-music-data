You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along


I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now


Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over


(Only time will tell)
One thing is sure
That time will tell
(Only time will tell)
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die


Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
The lying's over
Gone, like the tears that used to tide me over


You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along


(Only time will tell)
I see it now (Only time will tell)
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry-eyed
You think that I would have known by now


Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over
Over
Over
Over


(Only time will tell)
You're on your own (Only time will tell)
Inside your room
You're claiming victory
You were just using me
And there is no one you can use now
(Only time will tell)
