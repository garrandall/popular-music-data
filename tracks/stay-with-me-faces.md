Woo!
Get it


In the mornin' don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar


You won't need too much pursuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that
You got nothin' to laugh about
Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs
And read my tarot cards, come on


Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me, oh yeah
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me


So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up, come on, honey


Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get out
Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Hey, what's your name again?


Get out
