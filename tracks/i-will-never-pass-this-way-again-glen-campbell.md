I will pass this way but once if there's any good that I can do
Let me do it now for I'll never pass this way again
I will see this day but once if there's any kindness I can show
Let me show it now for I'll never see this day again
Tomorrow may be too late my friend to do all the good that you planned
So reach out to those who need you and lend them a helping hand
I will know this world but once if there's any love that I can give
Let me give it now oh Lord please show me how
For I'll never know this world I'll never see this day
I'll never pass this way again
