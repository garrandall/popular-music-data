You think I love you
For just one thing
To you my love this may be
The way that it seems

But I love the way, that you carry yourself
I really love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you, baby, love you
The way you wear your hair

Ain't that loving you, ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one
You're the one, only one
You're the one, listen girl

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that others
Other guys have said, don't you believe 'em

Well, I love you, yes, I do, for what you are
Yeah, I even love you, I love you, love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, baby, love you
For what you may become

Ain't that loving you everyday, every way
Ain't that loving you, oh, yeah, for more reasons than one
You're the one, you're the one, only one, only one
You're the one, I betcha never thought about it

Did it ever occur to you, why I do all that I can do?
To keep that smile upon your face that's why I love you
In so many ways, that's why I love you
In so many ways, oh la, baby

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that others
Other guys have said, slammed the door in your face

But I love you, everyday for what you are
Girl I even love you, I love you, love you, oh
For what you may become

Ain't that loving you, whole lot of love, everyday
Ain't that loving you, in every way, oh, yeah
For more reasons than one, you're the one
You're the one, only one, you're the one, listen girl

I love the way you wear your hair
I love the way that you carry yourself
I love the way that you squeeze me tight, yeah
I just love the way you make everything all right

I love the way you kiss my lips, girl
Baby, baby, love it when you're swinging your hips
Ain't that loving you for more reasons than one

Girl, I love the way you hold my hand
And there's no doubt I'm the only man, yeah
That could satisfy you, that could satisfy
I love to satisfy you, I love you, baby

Ohh, baby, oh, baby, I love you baby
For more reasons than one
You're the one, you're the one
