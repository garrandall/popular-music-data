She was pretty 
She was smart 
She was witty 
Yeah she had charm 
Cupid shot me 
That's what got me down the aisle 
But that match made in heaven 
Went straight to hell 
Split up our possessions 
Put the house up for sale 
And I learned a lesson I won't be forgetting 
The next time around 

I'm gonna marry for money 
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny 
I'm gonna have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub piece of the pie 
Find me a sweet sugar mama 
With a whole lot of zeros and commas 
Don't really care if she loves me 
She can even be ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

I won't have to love her family 
I won't have to like her friends 
And if it works out like I planned it, I won't ever have to work again 

I'm gonna marry for money 
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny 
I'm gonna have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub piece of the pie 
Find me a sweet sugar mama 
With a whole lot of zeros and commas 
I don't care if she loves me 
She can even be ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

Show me the money 

Cha-ching 

Y'all I'm gonna find a wife 
On a leer jet the old lady buys me 
I'll call her sweet heart & honey if she's a hundred and twenty 
I dont care if she loves me 
She can be really ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

Oh, cha-ching 
Mucho deniro 

Come over here you good lookin' thing, you 
There's your walker in the corner 
Ov'er ov'er
