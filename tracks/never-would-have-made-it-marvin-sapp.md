Never would have made it
Never could have made it without You
I would have lost it all
But now I see how You were there for me

And I can say
Never would have made it
Never could have made it
Without You

I would have lost it all
But I now I see
How You were there for me
And I can say

I'm stronger, I'm wiser
I'm better, much better

When I look back
Over all You brought me through
I can see that You were the One
I held on to

And I never, never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Oh, I never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)

Oh, I would have lost it all
Oh, but now I see
How You were there for me

I never
(Never would have made it)
No, I never
(Never could have made it without You)

I would've lost my mind
A long time ago
If it had not been for You
I'm

I am stronger
(I am stronger
I am wiser
(I am wiser)

And now I am better
(I am better)
So much better
(Much better)

I made it
Through my storm and my test
Because You were there
To carry me through my mess

I am stronger
(I am stronger
I am wiser
(I am wiser)

I am better
(I am better)
Anybody better
(Much better)

I can stand here and tell You
I made it
Anybody out there
That You made it

I'm stronger
(I'm stronger)
I am wiser
(I'm wiser)

I'm better
(I'm better)
Much better
(Much better)

I made it
(I made it)
I made it
(I made it)

I made it
(I made it)
I made it
(I made it)

Never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Never could have made
(Never could have made it without You)

I would have lost my mind
I would have gave up
But You were right there
You were right there

I never
(Never would have made it)
Oh, I never
(Never could have made it without You)

Somebody just
Need to testify this tonight
Next to them
Tell them

I am stronger, I am wiser
I am better, much better

When I look back
Over what He brought me through
I realize that I made it
Because I had You to hold on to

Now I am stronger, now I am wiser
I am better, so much better

I've made it
Is there anybody in this house other than me
That could declare You made it
Tell Your neighbor

Never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Tell em never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)

Oh, I wish I had some help here
I wish I had just two or three people
That would just declare it

Never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)

I just, I just love to encourage myself
Sometime I look in the mirror and say

I'm stronger, I'm wiser
I am better, so much better

When I look back over
What He brought me through
I realize that I made it
Because I had You to hold on to

But I never would have made it
I never could have made it without You
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lawdy
Oh, I good God, Almighty

Never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)

Sing it one more time
All I need is just one more time
Everybody sing with me

Never would have made it
Oh
Never could have made it without You
