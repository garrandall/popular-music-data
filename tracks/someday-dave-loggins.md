Now one day, girl
All of our dreams will come true
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Someday, girl we'll be together

I can see it all in visions of white
A long train in the stained glass light
Someday, you can be mine forever
'Cause sometime I can see it all
In my dreams
Wakin' up next to you
And walkin' around with my head on the ceiling
I'm in love, oh, what a feelin'

Ah honey, it's such a good feeling, oh
That is such a good feelin', oh
I won't have to leave you again
You know I almost believe it was meant to be that way
Someday, well it won't be long
And I just can't wait
But we got to be strong
And we got to have faith
And someday, girl, we'll be together
So, if you need something to hold onto
Hold onto me, girl, and I'll hold onto you
And someday, you can be mine forever

Yes sometimes I can see it all in my dreams
Just how it's gonna be
You'll be a mother and I'll be one of the children
I'm in love, but oh, what a feelin'
Oh honey, it's such a good feelin'
Girl you're gonna be mine forever
I just love you girl
I wanna love, love, love you, someday
Oh, how I need you honey
To love, love, love me, someday

Yes I love you, love
I'm gonna love, love, love you someday
Hey girl, I just love you, love you
I wanna love, love, love you someday
Oh how I just love you, love you
I wanna love, love, love you someday
Girl, how I just love you, love you
I wanna love, love, love you someday
