Oh! Papa catch the fish from the bottom of the sea
Mama fixes net, she keeps an eye on me
Dainty little Mama, smile all day
Cook your sweet potato, at night she lay, lay


Oh, Seaside Woman
Oh, Seaside Woman


Ride grey mule to market place each day
Sells her beads and baskets for seashell pay
Dainty little Mama, smile all day
Papa loves you Mama, and he say, say


Oh, Seaside Woman
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, Seaside Woman
(All right, snap it on Denny)

Oh, Seaside Woman
Oh, Seaside Woman
(Yeah
Turn around
I don't wanna walk, I don't wanna talk
I just wanna be with you)


Oh! Papa catch the fish from the bottom of the sea
Mama fixes net, she keeps an eye on me
Dainty little Mama, smile all day
Papa love you Mama, at night he lay, lay


Oh, Seaside Woman
Oh, Seaside Woman (oo yeah, hey!)
Oh, Seaside Woman
Seaside Woman
Seaside Woman
Seaside Woman (Yeah)
Seaside Woman
Seaside Woman
