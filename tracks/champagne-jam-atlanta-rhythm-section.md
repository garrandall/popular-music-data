Come on Mama, give me a break
Me and the boys are gonna stay out late
I can't help it, it's in my bones
We'll be jammin' all night long

Gonna play up a storm
Ooh, yeah sure am

We're gonna have us a champagne jam
We're gonna have us a champagne jam

Break out the guitars and let's play some blues
Don't want no whiskey gimme some high class booze
Pour us some champagne
Ooh, thank you ma'am

We're gonna have us a champagne jam
We're gonna have us a champagne jam
Yeah, so let's have some first class fun
Everybody gonna play some

Let's raise a ruckus, let's tie one on
Break out a bottle of Dom Perignon
If they throw us in jail, we don't give a damn

We're gonna have us a champagne jam
So, pour us some champangne, woo
Thank you ma'am, thank you ma'am

We're gonna have us a champagne jam
We're gonna have us a champagne jam
Hey yeah, yeah yeah
So come on

"Ah, play it Dean"

"Guitar"

What do you say, what'choo say...
Thank you ma'am
