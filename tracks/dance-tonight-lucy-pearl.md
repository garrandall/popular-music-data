I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money, yeah)

I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I wanna get freaky tonight (Freakin', baby, yeah)

First thing we need to do
Is buy brand new fits for you
Make sure that you look good
Make sure that I smell good

Let's purchase two new Bentleys
I know that it looks trendy
So glad that it's not windy

Here comes that girl named Jhani
Ask if she wants to go
Tonight's gonna be hot for sure
Be dancin' on the floor

Folks trippin' I don't know
Money flyin' everywhere
Champagne, we won't go there
Bottles poppin' in the air
They'll be screamin, "I don't care"

I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money, yeah)

I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I wanna get freaky tonight (Freakin', baby, yeah)

Look what the cat hauled in
Me and a couple friends
No need to settle down
My body don't know how

Right there I see you lookin'
Sure hope that you're not took and
Don't get lost in the crowd
This place is so damn wild

Go ahead and floss your ice
Go ahead do what you like
I'm feelin' just as fly
Do you think it's on tonight

I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money, yeah)

I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I wanna get freaky tonight (Freakin', baby, yeah)

Dance tonight, toast tonight
Spend you money, baby
Dance tonight, toast tonight
Freak your body, baby

Dance tonight, toast tonight
Spend you money, baby
Dance tonight, toast tonight
Freak your body, baby
