Darkchild
Oh, yeah, yeah
Toni Braxton, oh
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh
Darkchild, yeah


Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first


What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
And not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you


What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me


Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out


What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
See, I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
And not be worried about him, yeah
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you


What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me


Oh yeah
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah


What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
