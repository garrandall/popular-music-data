Yeah
Cash Money Heroes
Private Jets
Polish
Jay Sean fly


I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!

I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!


Known from the city
Where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight
Yeah, but now on top
I told you to let it rock, rock
The money's falling from the sky
I made it

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about
(yeah)
The life I'm living now
YMâ)
I know that there's no doubt
(âCMB, baby, Birdman, Swagged out, 100)
I made it, I made it!


Rooftop, hella chopper burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped with a priceless globe
High life, flipping and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor

When I hit, nigga, hit me full of that cash
More money than I've seen in a garbage can
Stunna Island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain make it shower

Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shorty new range
Flip another 100, popping throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunner

I look up to the sky
(to the sky)
And now the world is mine
(the world is mine)
I've known it all my life
(all my life)
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!


Ooh, I made it
I made it, I made it, I made it
Yo ay ay ay. Listen

See I don't live for glamour
And I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me
Then they calling my name

Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I done gon' "Platinum"
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down

I look up to the sky
(damn, man)
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!


Came from the gutter
Looking like my mother
Made it to the goal line
Straight out the huddle

Cash money goldmine
Weezy stay loyal
Boy we getting money
Like we just found oil

Uh, and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell 'em to loaf it when the bread pass

Staring at you from the top of the game, man
I might drop the world if I change hands
Uh, it feel good to be here
Weezy in the building got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about
The life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it! I made it!

I look up to the sky!
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I made it!

I made it, I made it
Yes, I did
Yes, I did
Yes, I did
Yes, I did
Yes, I did
I made it
