Yeah
Cash Money Heroes
Private Jets
Polish, Fly

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it

I used to dream about
The life i'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it

Known from the city where
No one believed in me
But I never give up the fight

Ya, but now on top
I told you to let it rock (rock)
The moneys falling from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it

I used to dream
About (yeah), the life
I'm living now (YM)

I know that
There's no doubt
I made it, I made it

Rooftop, hella choppa burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped with a
Priceless globe
High life, flippin, and get some more

Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When i hit, hit me full of that cash
More money than i see in a garbage can

Stunna island, money and the power
Thats how we do it, make it rain make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things

Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin throwing hundreds
In a new bently, uptown stunna

I look up to the sky (to the sky)
And now the world is mine (the world is mine)
I've known it all my life (all my life)

I MADE IT
I MADE IT

I used to dream about
The life i'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it

Oooh i made it
I made it...
I made it...
I made it...
Yo ay ay ay listen

See i don't live for glamour
And i don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change

They didn't believe in me
Then they calling my name
Now looked who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then

But ever since i've gone platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine (mine)
I've known it all my life (ooho ooho)
I made it, I made it

I used to dream about, the life i'm living now
I know that there's no doubt (ooho)
I made it, I made it

Came from the gutter
Lookin like my mother
Made it to the goal line
Straight out the huddle

Cash money goldmine
Weezy stay loyal
Boy we getting money
Like we just found oil
Uh and thats word to my red flag

I live first and leave the
Bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bedrash

And i just tell'em to loaf it
When the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man

I might drop the worldif i change hands
Uh it feel good to be here
Weezy in the building got this
Bitch rebuilt young money

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it

I used to dream about
The life im living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it

I look to the sky
I made it
I made it
I made it

OOO
I-I-I made it
Made it, I made it
Yes i did
Yes i did
Yes i did
Yes i did
Yes i did
I-I-I made it
