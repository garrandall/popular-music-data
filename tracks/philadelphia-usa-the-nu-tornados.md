When you see clear skies and hearts of gold
And a girl that wears a smile
Don't stop to check your roadmap
Philadelphia's bout a mile

When you see clear skies and hearts of gold
And a girl on every street
Just pull up to the sidewalk
Philadelphia's at your feet

I tell you now, my biggest moment
Is when I stop to see
That pretty blue-eyed angel
Who waits right there for me

I'm gonna tell her that I love her
That I miss her every day
That my heart just longs to be in
Philadelphia, USA

I tell you now, my biggest moment
Is when I stop to see
That pretty blue-eyed angel
Who waits right there for me

I'm gonna tell her that I love her
That I miss her every day
That my heart just longs to be in
Philadelphia, Philadelphia, USA
