Yeah 
Murder Inc. 
We invite you to: epic, ya know? 
We make music out of a sense of hunger 
Sort of a desire 
Through that desire 
We expose the pain and struggle 
But we accustom to live it 
So, we feel without this music, we have nothing 
So we offer you, well: we offer you our lives 
So how you gon' take it? 

 
See everybody wanna rise to the top these days 
(Top these days)
A lot of people might come and try to take your place 
(Take your place)
Oh you know that 
All you gotta do is keep rising, rising 
Don't look back and keep shining, shining 
I had a little struggle 
I had a little pain 
Now make it rain, make it rain, make it rain 

 

 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath till you just 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath yeah 

 
I stop and think how life could be so raw 
(Be so raw)
Sometimes I just don't wanna fight no more 
(Fight no more)
Oh you know just 
All you gotta do is keep rising, rising 
Don't look back and keep shining, shining 
I had a little struggle 
I had a little pain 
Now make it rain, make it rain, make it rain 

 

 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath till you just 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath yeah 

 

 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath till you just 
Rain on me (rain on me) 
Lord wont you take this 
Pain from me 
I don't wanna live 
I don't wanna breath yeah 

 
Rain down on me 
Oh, wont you take this 
Pain from me 
Oh wont you make it 
Rain down on me 
Lord wont you take this pain from me 

 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bada-bada
