I must know
I've got to know
I have the feeling that
You want to go
Tell me the truth
Is it over now?
Tell me the truth
Do you want her now?
Tell me the truth
Do you plan to forget me now?
Tell me the truth
I just got to know
Tell me the truth

I love you so
Tell me the truth
Why should you try to hurt me so?
I'll try to hide
What's inside of me
What has to be
It just has to be
Friends say to me
She has the key to your heart
Tell me the truth
Is it over now?
Tell me the truth
Do you want her now?
Tell me the truth
Do you plan to forget me now?
