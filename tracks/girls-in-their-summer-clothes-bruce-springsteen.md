Well the street lights shine
Down on Blessing Avenue
Lovers they walk by
Holding hands two by two
A breeze crosses the porch
Bicycle spokes spin around
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
Tonight I'm going to burn this town down

Girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
Girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by

Kid's rubber ball smacks
Off the gutter underneath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off go the sleepy front porch lights
Downtown the store's alive
As the evening's underway
Things been a little tight
But I know they're going to turn my way

Girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
Girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by

Girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
Girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by

Girls in their clothes
They pass me by
I still wanna know
What keeps you from staying a little while
Sometimes they're shy
Sometimes they smile
I still wanna try to make you feel home when you're by my side
