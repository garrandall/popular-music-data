Woah, let me tell you girl
Woah oh
Hey, here I go, here I go


I know you heard men say it
Time and time again
That they would rock your world
And change your life
But I can’t blame them
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get the drawers
Well I’m gone put my bid in
And get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is
They look out for themselves
But I’m doin’ it just to hear you yell, yeah


Oh
That’s gonna be the sound
Girl when it’s goin’ down
Your body sayin’
Oh
Don’t have to say my name
Girl I’m just glad you came
So you can say
Oh, In the morning
Oh, In the night
You sayin’ Oh means
I was hittin' it right
Oh, oh, oh
You can’t be mad at me
I’m just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream Oh


Girl come on over and
Let’s get this thing crackin’
You’ll be surprised when
You see what O’s I’m packin’
Cause I’m young but I’m ready
Tryna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I’m gone take you
Somewhere that never been
Show you some things that'll
Make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you
Can’t even say a thing
But that’s okay all you gotta say


Oh
That’s gonna be the sound
Girl when it’s goin’ down
Your body sayin’
Oh
Don’t have to say my name
Girl I’m just glad you came
So you can say
Oh, In the morning
Oh, In the night
You sayin’ Oh means
I was hittin' it right
Oh, oh, oh
You can’t be mad at me
I’m just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream Oh


Oh is for that overtime I’m puttin’ in
We’ll go for hours take a break
And go at in again
Girl I work my way from A
All the way to Z
But trust me baby girl
O is where you wanna be
Couldn’t believe me when I tell you
I’m not tryna tell you what to do
Cause when it’s said and done
The choice ain’t mine it’s really up to you
Just say yes don’t fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom
Jaw for me and just say Oh


Oh
That’s gonna be the sound
Girl when it’s goin’ down
Your body sayin’
Oh
Don’t have to say my name
Girl I’m just glad you came
So you can say
Oh, In the morning
Oh, In the night
You sayin’ Oh means
I was hittin' it right
Oh, oh, oh
You can’t be mad at me
I’m just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream Oh


Let me hear you say
Oh, when I’m hittin’ it
Let me hear you say
Oh, when I’m gettin’ it
Ohh...
Let me hear you say
Oh, when you come see Oh
Let me hear you say
Oh, when you come from the back to the front
Now somebody say my name
Let me hear you say
Oh, when the sun goin’ down
Let me hear you say
Oh, when you can’t make another sound
Now scream
Baby girl let me hear me scream Oh
Baby girl let me hear me scream Oh
