Looking back on the days
When I was scuffling for a buck
Not overly concerned with life and love
I was always feeling sorry
For myself and my bad luck
I never stopped to think what life's made of

With my nose to the grindstone
And my collar to the wheel
I fought for my daily dollar like a man
Then you came into my life
And nothing else seemed real
I found the answer right here in my hands

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing
In the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby-child
And eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need

Now my working days seem shorter
Than they ever did before
And the evening breeze gets cooler day by day
And the morning sun is always shining
Down on my backdoor
And your laughter washes all my tears away

And there's not a day goes by
When I don't look up to the sky
And humbly thank the good Lord up above
For bringing you to me in time
To make me realize
That all a poor man really needs is love

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing
In the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby-child
And eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got everything a man could ever need
