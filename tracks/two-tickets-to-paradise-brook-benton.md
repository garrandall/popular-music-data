Money, I ain't got none
Problems, I sure got some
But I got two tickets to paradise
Don't you want to go ?

Sadness all round
Gladness just can't be found
But I got two tickets to paradise
Don't you want to go with me?

Everything I did was wrong, the day was dark as night
But I found a girl whose love was strong, now every things alright
(All right, all right)

I got to hurry, my bag is packed
I'm leavin' and I ain't comin' back
'cause I got two tickets to paradise
Oh, now don't you want to go with me?

The first stop, we'll take a walk
Second stop, we'll have a talk
The third stop
Oh-ee, you better go with me

Everything I did was wrong, my days were dark as night
But I found a girl whose love was strong, now every things alright
(All right, all right)

I got to hurry, my bag is packed
I'm leavin' and I ain't comin' back
'cause I got me two tickets to paradise
Now don't you want to go with me?

The first stop, we'll take a walk
Second stop, we'll have a talk
The third stop trumpet blast
Oh-ee, don't you want to go with me?

Now don't you want to go with me?
Be my guest, come on and go with me
