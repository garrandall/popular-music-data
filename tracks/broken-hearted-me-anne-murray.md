Every now and then I cry
Every night
You keep staying on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me

Every day is just the same
Playing games
Different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted
Time won't heal a broken hearted me
