I'll be coming home, just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there
And I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait, to leave this place


No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better of alone


Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
(Home)


By the time you come home
I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV
And you scream at me
I can hardly wait
Til you get off my case


No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better of alone


Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
(Home)


I'm better off alone


No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better of alone


Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
