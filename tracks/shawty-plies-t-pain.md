Heey 
Whoop


We just Netflix and chilling up in your appartment
You got on them shorts that you got from your college, alright
But I'm so focussed right now
You know just what I'm trynna do
We was watching a movie
But now that bitch watching me watching you
Tell your roommate to stop being nosy
Cause me and you about to get cosy
You say you a freak, well then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly


Cause this ain't, this ain't what
You used to, you used to
And I got some of that good music for you to get loose to
Kissin just ain't enough
You know what's up
Got my hands all over your butt


Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what
I'm just being 100, yeah
You actin like, you don't wanna bust this nut
Are you tryin to run from me


Now I got you buttnaked on top of this carpet
You want it as bad as I do, so don't stop it
Girl, what's happening right now
Tell your roommate get back in the room
Cause we was watching a movie
Now she can see me on top of you
When she want to come in get to know me
Then all three of us can get cosy
You say you a freak, well then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly






You ain't even gotta take em all the way off
You in there pulling little things to the side
I ain't even bout to go lie to you beauty
Pussy good like Patti LaBelle sweet potatoe pie
I don't wanna hit you from the body one time
I be wanna eat you with the ice one time
I be wanna get out that thing, go to dance like Drizzy did in the video Hotline
Stretch marks on your lil ass like a tire
Don't you answer bitch, let's play tired
Do big balls bitch, I be here for the same
Had to strike one word with you, go let it snow
Let me dab in the pussy, like the damn Migo
Let me turn the lights on, like my dawg Rico
Make me Quan yeah, like Rich Homie tho
I don't get tired of you, I'm on a flow?




Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what
