Come on what the fuck is waiting up there for us, huh?
What the fuck's waiting for us?


He's gonna shoot him


Tell me or I'm gonna put two in your face right here


He didn't do it


He's not gonna shoot him
...
He's gonna shoot him


Like Nick Carter used to say if I'm wrong I swear to God I'll fucking apologize
Alright something's a miss I can feel it. If anything out the ordinary goes down
I swear to God you are gonna be the first one shot


Clarence he didn't anything what the fuck


Shut up alright I'm gonna blow this motherfucker away
Fuck you


I wish somebody would just come and get me because I don't like this anymore


Get a hold of yourself you fucking sissy


I wish that somebody would just come and take me away just take me away


Hang in there Elliot goddammit


I can't take this I'm sorry but I just can't and I know that if somebody would
Just come to rescue everything would be alright...
