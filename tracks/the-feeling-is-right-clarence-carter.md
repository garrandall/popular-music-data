Every time I'm with you darling
A fever comes over me, oh yeah
And there's a burning deep inside
That just won't let me be, oh no

I tried to be patient baby
But I just can't stand the pain, oh no
And there's no time like right now darling
While we're alone again

The feeling is right
And the time is right now
Now you say it, the feeling is right
I got to have your love

My desires won't wait forever darling
My willpower's growing weak, oh yeah
And I can't fill this need inside
With promises you won't keep, oh no

So put away your childish ways
And let the woman in you shine, oh yeah
And let a good thing come between us girl
Get down with this love of mine

The feeling is right
And the time is right now
Oh the feeling is right
I got to have your love

I said the feeling is right
And the time is right now
Sometime you make me feel like
