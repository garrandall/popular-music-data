(Yeah, yeah)
Warning! warning! warning!
To all those who have been yawning
Kids from foreign coming down inna the early morning
This is di don gorgon weh dem call, Edley
Only the Designer deh pon di side a me
Know say we a number one
The artical, Boom Shak-A-Tack
We a come down, this a natural fact
Carry the kids dem come, watch it Notch
Here this!
As the kids dem pop it off


Di wickedest time, me and mi girl a come
Born Jamericans, we tear di place down
Nuh put it down deh
Papa make it 'tand deh, yeah!
Sometimes coffee, sometimes tea
You know say Born Jamericans a celebrity
We ram dance a town, and in any country
All of di girls, me say dem love we, yeah!
Look how girls dem nice and sweet
Di glimmity-glammity weh deh underneath
We want it everyday, not to mention di week, woii!


Say reggae music run di world, fi respect that
Cuz every time we touch the mic dem screaming, Boom Shak-A-Tack
Crowd of massive catch di vibes, we're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition of the Boom-Shak-A-Tack


Now batty rider, tear off, nuh gyal pickney get hot
Now bwoy a beat down di wall, selector wheel up that!
It's Shine a gi' you di verbs, the action words
Drop down inna di roughneck sound, fi make the sound boys observe
I man would never run away inna di heart of battle
I 'round up di girls dem, like cowboy round up cattle
From line one, verse two, mi just a show off me skill
And I would never sell mi soul for a thousand dollar bill


Reggae music run di world, fi respect that
Cuz every time we touch the mic dem screaming, Boom Shak-A-Tack
Crowd of massive catch di vibes, we're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition of the Boom-Shak-A-Tack


Di wickedest time, me and mi girl a come
Born Jamericans, we tear di place down
Nuh put it down deh
Papa make it 'tand deh, yeah!
Look how girls dem nice and sweet
Di glimmity-glammity weh deh underneath
We want it everyday, not to mention di week, woii!


Physical fit is the kid, when me start to release
Me grab di microphone and chat fi make me dollars increase
Sexy girls to the flock, 'cuz he's a healthy young man
And me will surely gi' you di remedy one by one
Born Jamericans is di crew from the streets of Washington
Where nuff people smoke crack and the fire di M1
Mi legalize, mi nah despise, di air is rugged and rough
Some DJs open up their mouth, its like a damn trash truck


But, reggae music run di world, fi respect that
Cuz every time we touch the mic dem screaming, Boom Shak-A-Tack
Crowd of massive catch di vibes, we're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition of the Boom-Shak-A-Tack

9 Inches of lead, out to do damage
The Ed' pon di microphone, dem have fi respect that
Di lesson, definition, of di Boom-Shak-A-Tack
Di kid pon di microphone, mi nah lay down flat

A lyrical technician, that is my employment
Kids from foreign, how dem a go manage?

Sayonara, amigo (A so di kids dem mash it up)

This is a lesson, definiton
Of di Boom Shak-A-Tack
