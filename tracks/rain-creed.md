Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water


I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day


Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder


I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yeah!


I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
