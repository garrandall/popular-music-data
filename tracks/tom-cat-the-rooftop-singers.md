Spoken:
I've got an old Tom Cat
And when he steps out
All the other cats in the neighborhood
They begin to shout

There goes a ring tail Tom
Struttin' round the town
And if you got your heat turned up
You better turn your damper down

Ringtail Tom is a star
He's a boss around this town
He don't allow no other Tom Cats
Come pussy footin' around

Ringtail Tom on the fence
Little pussy cat on the ground
Ringtail Tom com-a-off-a that fence
They start rousin around

Ringtail Tom is a star
He's a natural born crack shot
He finds a new target every night
And he sure does practice alot

And if you got your heat turned up
You better turn your damper down
