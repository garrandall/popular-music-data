Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da


I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times have I kicked you out of here?
Or said something insulting?
Da da da da da
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is broken
Da da da da da


Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me


How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby, I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise
Da da da da da


Please, don't leave me (oh)
Please, don't leave me (don't leave me)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me


I forgot to say out loud
How beautiful you really are to me
I can't be without
You're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you
I'm sorry
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da


Please, please, don't leave me
Baby, please, don't leave me (no, don't leave me)
Please, don't leave me (I always say)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me (I, I)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, please, don't leave me


Baby, please, please, don't leave me
