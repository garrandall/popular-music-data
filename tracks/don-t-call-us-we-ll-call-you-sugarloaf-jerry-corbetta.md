A Long distance directory assistance, area code 212
Say hey, A and R this is mister rhythm and blues
He said hello, and put me on hold
To say the least the cat was cold
He said, don't call us child we'll call you
I said, you got my number
He said yeah, I got it when you walked in the door
Don't call us, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you
I got your name from a friend of a friend
Who said he used to work with you
Remember the all night creature from stereo ninety two
Yeah I said could you relate to our quarter track tape
You know the band performs in the nude
He said uh huh don't call us child we'll call you
Listen kid you paid for the call
You ain't bad but we've heard it all before
And it sounds like John, Paul and George
Any way, we cut a hit and we toured a bit
With a song he said he couldn't use
And now he calls and begs and crawls
It's telephone deja vu
We got percentage points and lousy joints
And all the glitter we can use, Mama
So, uh huh, don't call us now, we'll call you
Listen kid you paid for the call
You ain't bad but I've heard it all before
Don't call us, we'll call you
Don't call us
Don't call us, we'll call you
