Time was... when we got along
Time was... when we got along
It's too bad, that feeling's gone

Time was... when we could agree
Time was... when we could agree
That time's gone, now you find fault with me

I've got time, things will work out fine

Trouble... will not wreck my life
Trouble... will not wreck my life
Someday you'll like, what I'm putting down
