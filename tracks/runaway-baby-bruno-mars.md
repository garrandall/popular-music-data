Oh yes


Well, looky here, looky here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding


I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away..."
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say


Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby


Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it


I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away..."
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say


Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby


See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby
If you scared you better run
(You better run) you better run
(You better run) you better run
You better, you better, you better


Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
