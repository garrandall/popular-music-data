When I was younger, man
I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair

You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life
Oh babe
You got what it takes
So I made you my wife

Since then
I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, oh
I love you

You came along
From far away
And found me here

I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile

You said
You're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile

And as my head was spinning 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oh
I want you

Thank you, babe
For being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, oh
I need you

As my head was coming round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oh
I want you

Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, oh
I need you

Since then I never looked back
It's almost like livin' a dream
Oh
I got you

If ever a man had it all
It would have to be me
And, oh
I love you
