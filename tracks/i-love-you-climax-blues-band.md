Don't wanna worry you, baby
Don't wanna bring you down
But if my love is too hot to handle
Let me know now

I've got this yearnin' inside me
And it's runnin' deeper than the night
So don't go fooling with my hunger
If you can't keep me satisfied
I'm warning you

Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough love

Before we go any further I think you should know
I can't get by on part of your love, babe
I've got to have it all

My only rule is desire
And it moves me stronger than the wind
So don't go fooling with my fire
'Cause you won't stop me once I begin
I'm warning you

Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough love

My only rule is desire
And it moves me stronger than the wind
So don't go fooling with my fire
'Cause you won't stop me once I begin
I'm warning you

Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough

Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough

Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
Gotta have more love, I just can't get enough
