Love of my life
Take my heart take my soul
Take what you need
Love of my life
Don't you know I'm just a fool for a good woman's greed

You broke the wings of a weary vagabond
And I'm stranded on the island of your love
You are the fruit of my amazon
Love of my life I'm no good on my own

Love of my nights
Take my pride take my flesh
Take all my blues
Love of my life
Don't you know my life's a bore
When there's nothing to lose

I am the prisoner of your paradise
Sunken in the bayou of your love
I make this sensual sacrifice
Love of my life
For the good of my own
Love of my life
I'm no good on my own

Love of my life
Take my heart take my soul
Take what you feel
Love of my life
Don't you know I'm just a man
For a woman who's real

Love of my life ...
Love of my life ...
Love of my life ...
