Hit it

How you feeling, brother
(Feeling good.)
You feel good?
Play so much 'bone, brother!

How you feel, man?
(I feel all right.)
I won't call your name
I don't want no people
To know you're in here

How you feeling, brother?
Hey, Jab! Sure getting down
Lookit here, ha!

We're gonna have a funky good time
We're gonna have a funky good time
We're gonna have a funky good time
We're gonna have a funky good time

Now, take 'em up, Fred
We gotta take you higher
All right, gonna do it again
You wanna do it again
We gotta take you higher

Brother?
(Yeah?)
Now I want everybody
To let Fred blow about two choruses
Then I'm gonna wave you in
And let's go into what we did just now
All right?
(All right! All right!)

I wanna get that fella
With the little horn over there


Fred, can you take us higher
(Yeah)
Take us higher
Fred, Fred, Fred

You know what
When I hear a groove like this groove
Oh, it say I got to take you higher
Yeah, baby, yeah, yeah
Like way up yonder, man
And things

Lookit here
Someone got a groove like this
You know, you know, know
I need the grit, got the grit
Gonna eat, got the grit
Get the job, got the job
Need the grit, got the grit

Now, Fred, you know
Hey, Fred Thomas, brother
I'm getting ready to wave y'all in
Y'know what
I feel so down, I need to get down
In order for me to get down, I gotta get in D

In order for me to get down, I gotta get in D
Need to get in D
Dog for D, down D
Funky D, D
Down D!



Get on down
, you like D!
That make him think about Macon, The Big M

Look here, look at that
This you over there?
(Who is that cat?)
You better sing one verse for us
What we gotta do

We gotta have a
Funky good time, oh, yeah
We gotta have a
Funky good time, oh, yeah

I didn't know you
Were singing, Fred
(I'm moanin'!)
Don't moan so much, brother
Don't moan so much!

We gotta have a
Funky good time
We gotta have a
Funky good time
We gotta take you higher

Wait a minute
Now who you say that was over there
(I dunno. Mangey looking cat
I know that I seen him somewhere
Is that Maceo?)

He's doing everything over there

(Maceo?)
Is it who
(Maceo. You know, like Maceo, won't you blow?)

Maceo, won't you blow
Oh, yeah, Maceo...
