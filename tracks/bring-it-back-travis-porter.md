Runnin' in that pussy like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes, shake that ass for me
Bounce that ass on the flo', bring it back up
Hit a split on the dip, shawty act up

Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back
Bring It Back
Bring It back
Bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back
Shake That Ass, Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass

Shake that ass, shake that ass
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Bring it back, bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
Shawty goin' hard, concrete
She can shake her ass, one cheek, two cheeks
Both cheeks, both cheeks
I got a white girl forreal, she got no cheeks
Got a police bitch on a short leash
Got good mouth like she got no teeth
She a slut, she a dog, she a bitch with it
Man you see the way she work, she super thick with it
Have them ho's throwin' salt, tell the bitch get it

Started playin' with her pussy, tell the bitch split it
Ride that pussy, I just wanna fuck you
If you ain't with it, you cute, but shawty fuck you
Runnin' in that pussy like a crash dummy

Bend it over, touch ya toes, shake that ass for me
Bounce that ass on the flo', bring it back up
Hit a split on the dip, shawty act up
Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back

Bring It Back
Bring It back
Bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

Shake That Ass, Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass
I do a donut in that Pussy cause I'm from the bay
Ran through a bunch of bad bitches in my day

Im older than ya momma
But I don't fuck cougars
Yo daddy was a player mane how you such a loser
When ya momma was a young thing, I knew her
But even back then nigga I aint wanna do her
I like the ones who know how to shake it
Not just at the club, lemme see you when you naked
YOU GO!
I aint gotta say it no more
Drop it to ground girl lay it on the floor
Pussy so wet, its like a day out on the boat
Open up wide ---

Too much fun, is what I'm having
Cause all that booty is what I'm grabbing
Short Dog, I don't stop rappin
BEEITCH

You know whats happenin.
Runnin' in that pussy like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes, shake that ass for me
Bounce that ass on the flo', bring it back up
Hit a split on the dip, shawty act up

Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back
Bring It Back
Bring It back

Bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Shake That Ass, Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass

Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
Back that ass up like a dump truck
If you havin' fun in the club, throw ya pumps up
All my ballas in the buildin' throw ya ones up
If you ain't throwin' no money then get ya funds up

I asked her what's her name and she said her name Nicki
Got a real big booty and some real big titties
Say she don't really come out to the city
'Cause she a country girl and she like to get busy
She got a good job and she say she 24
I said "okay" then shawty hit the flo' and I was like "whoa"
Then I threw some ones just to let shawty know
Just to let shawty that I'ma
Run it in that pussy like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes, shake that ass for me
Bounce that ass on the flo', bring it back up
Hit a split on the dip, shawty act up
Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back,
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring that ass back like you left some
Shawty so hot she can melt some
Feel like I wanna smack her with a belt or something
So I told her come here so I can tell her something
I wanna see ya big booty on my upper leg
And I'll throw a couple dollars at ya upper head
How 'bout you and ya friends you give me double head
At breakfast time she gave me supper head
And that's a great feelin'
And I fuck with her because she so willin'
To do whatever that I tell her
So I broke it down and this is what I tell her
Ima Run it in that pussy like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes, shake that ass for me
Bounce that ass on the flo', bring it back up
Hit a split on the dip, shawty act up

Now bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back
Bring It Back
Bring It back
Bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back
Shake That Ass, Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake that ass

Shake that ass, shake that ass
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Act a fool, act a fool
Bring it back, bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
Bring it back, Bring it back
