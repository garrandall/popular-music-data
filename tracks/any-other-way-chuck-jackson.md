I'm free

Here you come again
And you call yourself my friend
But I know why you're here
That girl of mine
Wants to know how I feel

Well, you can
Tell her that I'm happy
Tell her that I'm free
And say I won't have it
No, no, no, no, no, no
Any other way

That's right

People are talking
Since we've been apart
Everybody's saying
There he goes with a broken heart

Well, you can go back
And tell her that I'm happy
Tell her, tell her that
I'm free and say

That I won't have it
No, no, no, no, no, no
Any other way

'Cause I'm free, ha

That's all I gotta say, my friend
Now I think we better say bye bye
I think you'd better go right now
Or you might see a big man cry

Just tell her
Tell her that I'm happy
Go on and tell her
Tell her that I'm free and say

Chuck wouldn't have it
No, no, no, no, no, no
Any other way

'Cause he's free
Yes, I'm free
I'm free, I'm free

Everyday, I'm free
Without you, I'm free
Free at last, free at last
