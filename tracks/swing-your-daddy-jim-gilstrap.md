Swing your daddy, sexy mama
You got his love jones out of control
Now don't you wanna
Swing your daddy, take him higher
Send him up to heaven's heights
Light my fire
Spend my very last dime
Showing you a good time
But now the piper must be paid and I'm afraid
I'm just about to lose my mind
Swing your daddy, sexy mama
Come on and rock your baby tonight - get tight
Say you wanna
Swing, swing, swing your daddy
Swing, swing, swing your daddy
Life keep tickin' away
Tomorrow's almost today
Sweet child, fill my lovin' cup, stir it up
Your daddy's been achin' to play
Swing your daddy, sexy mama
You got his love jones out of control
Now don't you wanna
Oh, feel so good
You know you're outa sight, girl
Swing your daddy tonight
Oh oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh oh oh, yeah...
