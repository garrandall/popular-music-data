Girl I can't believe you tried to play me for fool
I almost didn't see this one coming (You don't love me)

Chorus:
Girl don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby I know your love's not true
Quit trying to playing me for a fool
Girl you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind baby I can see
So why don't you admit
You don't love me

You called me on the phone
Saying you'll be late coming home
You said your boss is making you work late
But I don't believe it
Cause when I called your office
So that I could speak with you
You know what they told me
They told me that you quit last week
And how can you explain
That when we make love
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside baby

(Chorus)
I saw you on the street
At the place we were supposed to meet
But you were with another man
I couldn't believe it
So I asked your friends
Who the hell was he(who was he)
You know what they told me
It was the guy that you met last week
And now I can explain
Why when we make love
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss
Your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside baby

Girl don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby I know your love's not true
Quit trying to playing me for a fool
Girl you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind baby I can see
So why don't you admit
You played with my heart
And try to play me for a fool (yea)
And like the saying goes
What goes around comes around
And one day, you'll know how exactly how it feels (how it feels oh
