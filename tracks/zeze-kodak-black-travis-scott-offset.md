D.A. got that dope!


Ice water, turned Atlantic (Freeze)
Night crawlin' in a Phantom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Told 'em "Hold it, don't you panic"
Took an island, flood the mansion (Yah, big woe)
Drop the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe, you can't stand it (It's lit)
Bitches undercover (In the sheets)
I'm an ass and titties lover (Big ass)
Guess we all meant for each other
Now that all the dogs free (Yeah, yeah)
And we out in these streets (Alright)
Can you do it? Can you pop it for me?


Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit
Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit


Offset!
Blow the brains out the coupe (Boom)
Police wanna talk, but I'm on mute (Woop woop, hey)
I'ma bust her wrist down 'cause she cute (Ice)
Fuck her on the yacht, dive in the pool (Yeah)
She an addict (Addict)
Addict for the lifestyle and the Patek (Patek)
Big daddy, have you ever felt Chanel fabrics? (Chanel)
I be drippin' to death, I need a casket (Drippin')
And we got more stripes than the ref, we foul, tech 'em (Bow, stripes)
In the middle of the field like David Beckham (Field, bow)
All my niggas locked up for real, I'm tryna help 'em (Free, free)
When I got a mill, got me the chills, don't know what happened (Oh, chills)
Pop pills, do what you feel, I'm on that zombie (Hey, hoo)
I'm more like Gaddafi, I'm not no Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)
I'm more like I'm David, Goliath runnin' (Hey, hey)
Niggas be clonin', I find it funny (Clone, haha)
We from the Nawf, straight out the dungeons (We from the Nawf, hey)
I go in her mouth, she can't tell me nothin' (Egh, egh, egc)
Three hundred the watch is out of your budget (Woo, woo, three hundred)
Mean muggin' got me clutchin'
And the stick right out of Russia


Ice water, turned Atlantic (Freeze)
Night crawlin' in a Phantom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Told 'em "Hold it, don't you panic"
Took an island, flood the mansion (Yah, big woe)
Drop the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe, you can't stand it (It's lit)
Bitches undercover (In the sheets)
I'm an ass and titties lover (Big ass)
Guess we all meant for each other
Now that all the dogs free (Yeah, yeah)
And we out in these streets (Alright)
Can you do it? Can you pop it for me?


Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit
Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit

In the Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nothin' favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on a pallet turned me to a savage
I'm a Project Baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride that dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Selene
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit
Pull up in the Demon on God
Lookin' like I still do fraud
Flyin' private jet with the rod
It's that Z shit, it's that Z shit

Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh
Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh
Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh
Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh
