Ooh
Ooh, yeah

I've never known someone before
Who feels the way you do
All my dreams somehow came true
With you
And I've never wanted someone more
As much as I want you
Love will last forever, it's true
With you

I will always fear
(I will always fear)
Awaking in the night
And not having you by my side

(It's not a dream)
We all need love and understanding
(We must break through)
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes

(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love to need
(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight
When I looked at him it's love)
Eternally

They say I should be acting cool
They tell me I'm a fool
But they don't see the things I see
In you

We cannot forget
(We cannot forget)
The changes we've been through
I could never love someone new

(Don't say goodbye)
It would tear in two my heart
(The time is right)
And we could never be apart
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes

(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love to need
(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight)
When I looked at him it's love
Eternally

(It's not a dream)
We all need love and understanding
(We must break through)
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes

(When I looked at him)
When I
(And he turned to me)
Looked at him
(He said you're more than a friend)
To love
(To love to need)
To need
(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight)
(When I looked at him it's love)
Eternally

(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love
(To love to need)
To need
(When I looked at him
And he held me so tight)
Held me, held me tight
(When I looked at him it's love)
When I
(Eternally)
Looked at him

(When I looked at him)
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me)
