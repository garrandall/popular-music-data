Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin everynight when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I've got a good job I work hard for my money
When it's quittin time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Whoa, Cadillac, Black jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie

The bartender asks me says son what'll it be
I want a shot at that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floors hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, in-laws, crooks and straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Whoa, Cadillac, Black jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Whoa, Cadillac, Black jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Yeah, get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie

I said get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
Oh get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie
