I removed your picture from my wall
Now what used to be a house too big
Is now a room too small

Every time I close my eyes
I'd realize
I couldn't find enough things to do
I never really got over you


I wrote you letters
I got no reply
And just when I was walking out on Love
To my surprise

Don't you wanna come inside
Where it's warm and dry?
Instead of standing in the doorway
With tears in your eyes


This time
I won't back down
This time
I'll stand my ground

I don't think you realize
What went on inside
Now I'm never gonna give up
Until I'm back by your side


I fought off heartaches
One by one
And when I was about to give up
I`d realize the day was gone

Every time I'd close my eyes
I'd see you cry
I can't forget the look on your face, baby
When I said goodbye


I read your letters each and every night
With intent and pen in hand
I was much too weak to write

Every night I'd pace the floor until
I couldn't take it anymore
I was just about to give up
Then you opened the door


This time
I won't back down
This time
I'll stand my ground

I don't think you realize
What went on inside
Now I'm never gonna give up
Until I'm back by your side

Before we went wrong, you know
We used to be so right
I know we should surrender to love
But we gave up without a fight


I just wanna let you know
I never should've let you go
Boy, I wanna be back in your arms
So let's try it once more


This time
I won't back down
This time
I'll stand my ground

I don't think you realize
What went on inside
Now I'm never gonna give up
Until I'm back by your side

This time
I won't back down
This time
I'll stand my ground

I don't think you realize
What went on inside
Now I'm never gonna give up
Until I'm back by your side

This time
I won't back down
This time
I'll stand my ground

I don't think you realize
What went on inside
Now I'm never gonna give up
Until I'm back by your side
