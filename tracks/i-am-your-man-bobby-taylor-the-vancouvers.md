Rely on me to supply your needs from now on
Shelter you and be a pillar to lean on
For in your eyes I see what I was born to be


And now, now my life can begin
For I am your man
Oh yes, I am, yes I am
I'm your man


There's no sacrifice great or small I wouldn't do
See my ambition is, is bringin' happiness to you
And if trouble comes our way
I won't run, I want us to stay


Right by your side, see that's where I'm gonna stay
For I am your man
Oh, yes, I am, little darling, little darling
I'm your man


My childish days are through
Wanna be someone you can look up to
Someone who can protect
Oh, someone who you can respect
Oh, I just wanna make myself worth it
Of the precious, precious love I know you be givin' me
Yeah, I want nothin' more for myself
Your love is my greatest wealth


And when you take my hand
And when you take my hand
You will proudly say, "Oh, this is my man"
Oh, yes, I am, little darling, little darling
I'm your man
Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, yeah, yeah
I'm your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby, baby
