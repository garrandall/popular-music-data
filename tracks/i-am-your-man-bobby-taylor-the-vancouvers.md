Woo hoo, baby baby, baby baby

Rely on me, to supply your needs from now on
Shelter you, and be a pillar to lean on
For in your eyes I see what I was born to be

And now, now my life can begin
'Cause I am your man (I am your man)
Oh yes I am, yes I am, little darlin'
I, I'm your man

Listen baby
There's no sacrifice, great or small, I wouldn't do for you
My ambition is, bringin' happiness to you
And if trouble comes our way
I won't run, I promise to stay

Right by your side, that's where I'm gonna stay
'Cause I am your man (I am your man)
Oh, yes I am, baby
I, I'm your man

And my childish days are through
I wanna be someone you can look up to
Oh, someone who can protect you
Someone you can respect
Oh, I'm trying to make myself worth it
Of all the love I know you've been givin' me
I want nothin' more for myself
Your love is my greatest wealth

And when you take my hand
You can proudly say, "This is my man"
I am your man
Yes I am, yes I am, darlin'
I, I'm your man
(Baby don't worry) Baby don't you worry
(I am your man) I am your man
I'll be there in a hurry
I, I'm your man
Baby, baby, baby
(I am your man)
