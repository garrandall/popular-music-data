I hear the sound of distant drums
Far away, far away
And if they call for me to come
Then I must go and you must stay 

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
Let's share all the time we can before it's too late
Love me now for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

I hear the sound of bugles blow
Far away, far away
And if they call, then I must go
Across the sea, so wild and grey. 

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
For the distant drums might change our wedding date 
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me
