That girl
My friend, that girl that's now kissing you
Let me tell you
That same little girl
She's going to break your heart in two

I know I know because

(I'm a witness) I am a witness
(I'm a witness) I am a witness
I am a witness to what this little girl will do
I want to talk to you I want to tell you a few words

I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you because you're my best friend
And I don't know where this story is going to end
This woman's got lips sweeter than honey from a honeycomb
And this girl's got lips that make a young boy lose his home
And she's got lips that know how to talk that talk
And you can just look at yourself and see that she knows how to walk that walk
So when you look as sad, as sad as could be
Don't worry about it man, she did the same thing to me

I know because

(I'm a witness) I am a witness
(I'm a witness) I am a witness
I am a witness to what this little girl will do
I'm not through yet. I'm not gonna be through for a while
I'm gonna talk to you, and tell you

And for four long year I was her fool
For four long years all through high school
Now when I first met her, I first met her
I gave her my class pin
And the very same night she was out with my best friend
And time came, came for us to graduate
You know what she did she showed up at the prom with a brand new date, yes she did
And I just stood there with tears in my eyes
She didn't even stop to apologize

I know

(I'm a witness) I am a witness
(I'm a witness) I, I am a witness
I am a witness. I know what this little girl will do
And you don't believe me by the way you're lookin at me
I'm gonna tell you one more time
I wanna tell you one more time

(I'm a witness) I am a witness
(I'm a witness) I am a witness
