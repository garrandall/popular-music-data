You're dangerous
cause you're honest
You're dangerous
You don't know what you want
Well you left my heart
Empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt

You're an accident
Waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass
Left there on the beach
Well you tell me things
I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me
Just out of reach

Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee

Well you stole it
Cause I needed the cash
And you killed it
Cause I wanted revenge
Well you lied to me
Cause I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends

Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee

Who's gonna ride your wild horses
