Tomboy, Tomboy, nuthin' but a Tomboy
Tomboy, Tomboy, nuthin' but a Tomboy

When we were small, I used to call you "Tomboy"
The years have flown since you were known as "Tomboy"
No made-up face, no fancy lace, pigtails in your hair
It seems like only yesterday
You tagged behind me everywhere!

I never thought that I'd get caught by "Tomboy"
The pink chiffon worked magic on my "Tomboy"
An' now I find, I've been blind
You were always on my mind
Before I'm through, you'll say I do
An' "Tomboy" will be mine!

Tomboy, Tomboy, nuthin' but a Tomboy
Tomboy, Tomboy, nuthin' but a Tomboy

No made-up face, no fancy lace, pigtails in your hair
It seems like only yesterday
You tagged behind me everywhere!

I never thought that I'd get caught by "Tomboy"
The pink chiffon worked magic on my "Tomboy"
An' now I find, I've been blind
You were always on my mind
Before I'm through
You'll say I do
An' "Tomboy" will be mine!
Tomboy!
