All day I face a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water (water)(water)(water)
Old Dan and I, with throats burned dry
An' souls that cry for water (water)(water)
Cool (water)
Clear (water)
Water (water, water)

A-keep a-movin, Dan (water)
Don't you listen to him, Dan (water, water)
He's the devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water (water)
Dan, can't you see that big green tree (water)
Where the water's runnin' free (water)
And it's waitin' there for me and you
Cool clear water (water, water)

Shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water (water)(water)(water)
And way up there he'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water (water)(water)
Cool (water)
Clear (water)
Water (water)(water, water)(water)

A-keep a-movin, Dan (water)
Don't you listen to him, Dan (water, water)
He's the devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water (water)
Dan, can't you see that big green tree (water)
Where the water's runnin' free (water)
And it's waitin' there for me and you
Cool clear water (water, water)

(Keep a-movin, Dan) (water)
(Don't you listen to him, Dan) (water, water)
(He's the devil not a man)
(And he spreads the burning sand with water) (water, water, water)
Cool clear water (water, water, water)
