He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention


As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention


So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today


Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right


I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention


So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem


I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die
