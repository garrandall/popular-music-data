Ah, yeah
C'mon now
You're looking good

I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that girl's got into your blood
Go out and get her

If you want her to be
The very heart of you
Makes you want to breathe
Now Listen
Here's what you got to do

Tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now

I know something about love,
You gotta show it and
Make her see the moon up above
Reach out and get itr
If you want her to be always by your side
If you want her to
Only think of you

You gotta tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now

I know something about love
You gotta take it and
Show her what the world is made of
A kiss will prove it
If you want her to be always by your side
Take her hand tonight,
And swallow your foolish pride

Go On and tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now

Ah yeah, go on and tell that girl

Tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now
