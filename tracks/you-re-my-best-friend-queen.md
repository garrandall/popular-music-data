My lips is thick 
My hips is curvy 
My body sick 
I like it dirty 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 


I got you moaning
Like a pornstar 
I'm all in 
I goes hard 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 

I never seen an ass like that 
no I never seen seen an ass so fat (tat, tat, tat) 
I'mma beat it til tomorrow 
And all I keep telling her is "shut up bitch, swallow" 
Your legs is shaking 
I won't hurt you 
Now you can be the star of that new commercial 
Wipe your lips 
Wipe your tits	
Brace yourself I'm about to hit you with this (ah) 
I couldn't say it 
'Cause the radio station, they wouldn't play it 
I'm too perverted 
I'm bout to hurt it 
The jury's all in 
That pussy's murdin 


My lips is thick 
My hips is curvy 
My body sick 
I like it dirty 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 


I got you moaning
Like a pornstar 
I'm all in 
I goes hard 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 


Yeah right to you 
We gon make it hot in here 
I'mma do a dance 
In my vicky way, look at here 
How you want it daddy, just let mommy know 
I'm bouncing on that thing 
Like I'm driving on the 64 
I got that juicy juicy 
You gonna need a straw 
That platinum pussy showin nigga what he trickin for 
Skinny short dick or long Imma ride that pony 
Make it rain and lighting on me 
Why don't you just buy for me 
Cars and jewlery 
I like expensive clothes 
My puerto rican baby 
Can you pay my house loans? 
It's that murder mami 
Lil Kim the queen bee 
I got that boy baby 
I'mma make you need me 


My lips is thick 
My hips is curvy 
My body sick 
I like it dirty 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 


I got you moaning
Like a pornstar 
I'm all in 
I goes hard 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby 


I go hard, go all in, get deeper and deeper 
I beat, beat it up 
I'm blowing your speakers 
And I ain't talked about a tridda 
Puerto rican to the car no boricua (?) 
Shit I have you moanin 
Fuckin your best friend til 6 in the mornin 
She kissed the girl, guess what? she liked it 
Well that your girl, go ahead and wife it 
Now fuck her I did, I went and piped it 
Put her on a video where youre all invited 
Fuck faces expressions get me excited 
That pussy make me work I dont need a diet 


My lips is thick 
My hips is curvy 
My body sick 
I like it dirty 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby

 
I got you moaning
Like a pornstar 
I'm all in 
I goes hard 
Work it baby 
Hurt me baby
