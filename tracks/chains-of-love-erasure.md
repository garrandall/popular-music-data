How can I explain
When there are few words I can choose
How can I explain
When words get broken
(Yeah)

Do you remember
There was a time ahaha
When people on the street
Were walking hand in hand in hand
They used to talk about the weather
Making plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up (Don't)
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love

Do you remember
Once upon a time ahaha
When there were open doors
An invitation to the world
We were falling in and out with lovers
Looking out for others
Our sisters and our brothers

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up (Don't)
Together with me and my baby
Together we'll break these chains of love

How can I explain
When there are few words I can choose
How can I explain
When words get broken

We used to talk about the weather
Making plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up (Don't)
Together with me and my baby break these chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up (Don't)
Together with me and my baby break the chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up (Don't)
Together with me and my baby break the chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love
