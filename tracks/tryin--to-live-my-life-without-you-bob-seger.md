I used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day
It was the hardest thing to put them away
I drank four or five bottles of wine
I kept a glass in my hand all the time

Breakin' those habits
Was hard to do
But nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through

Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It was the hardest burden I'll ever bear

I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changin' my way of living was hard to do
But it's nothin' compared to the changes that you put me through

I've done everything I tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you

Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
