Trashmen didn't get my trash today
Oh why? Because they want more pay
Buses on strike want a raise in fare
So they can help pollute the air

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The up and downs, a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young man
People make the world go 'round

You find Wall Street losin' dough on every share
And they're blaming it on longer hair
Big men smokin' in their easy chairs
On a fat cigar and they don't a care

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The up and downs, a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young man
People make the world go 'round

People make the world go 'round and round and round we go
Some go up and some go down and down and down and down we go

People make the world go 'round
Make it every day
Some go up and some go down
You know it works that way

But that's what makes the world go round
The up and down, a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young man

We go, we go up and down and up and down we go
We go, we go up and all around, where it stops nobody knows

People make the world go 'round
Make it every day
Some go up and some go down
You know it works that way

We go, we go up and down and up and down we go
We go, we go up and all around, where it stops nobody knows

People make the world go 'round
Make it every day
Some go up and some go down
You know it works that way

We go, we go up and down and up and down we go
We go, we go up and all around, where it stops nobody knows
