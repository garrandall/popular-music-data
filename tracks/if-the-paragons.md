If they made me a king
I'd be but a slave to you
If I had everything
I'd still be a slave to you
If I ruled the night
Stars and moon so bright
Still I'd turn for light to you

If the world to me bowed
Yet, humbly I'd flee to you
If my friends were a crowd
I'd turn in my need to you
If I ruled the earth
What would life be worth
If I hadn't the right to you

(They made me a king
I'd be but a slave to you
If I had everything
I'd still be a slave to you)

If I hadn't the right to you
