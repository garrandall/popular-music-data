I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
Said I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like, like we can


It ain't easy walkin' in stilettos
But somebody gotta do it
Spend a day in my shoes
Then see what the hell I go through
It's so rigorous
Doing what I do
Always on point
Always on cue
Life's so hectic
Call it a zoo
Think you understand
If you only knew


I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
Said I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like, like we can


I need fashion, elegance
Is a passion
I built this body to relax it
Try to bring me down
I'm a get the last laugh in
Don't need to talk
I speak with actions
I've perfected the laws of attraction
I'm the whole package plus satisfaction
Let it take yourself
'Fore you get what you asking
Don't get it twisted
Give your self a caution
Respect it's all that I'm asking
Women bless life, equals alright
No woman no life
I like to see him try


I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
Said I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like, like we can


Say yeaahhh, yeaahh (yeaahhh, yeaahh)
Say yeaahhh, yeaahh (yeaahhh, yeaahh)
Say yea yea yea, (yea yea yea)
Say yea yea yea, (yea yea yea)
Say I'm a woman, I'm a woman (I'm a woman, I'm a woman)
Say I'm a woman, I'm a woman (I'm a woman, I'm a woman)
I am woman
I am woman
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like I can


I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like we can
Said I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like we can
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I am (I am) woman (woman)
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
Yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
