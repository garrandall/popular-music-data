Hear me girl
You tell me you love me
But you've been seen with somebody else
Hear me girl
You tell me you want me
But I've been sittin' here all by myself


If this is love, oh baby
Then I'd rather be lonely
If this is love, oh baby
Then I'd rather be free
Your attitudes have changed so much
It makes me feel like I've lost my touch
The things we try to do just ain't the same
Your love for me has turned into a game
Ohh baby


In a moment of tenderness
I can almost see, almost see the love
But was it really there
Or was it just playin' another one of our games
Someone please tell me
Is the girl for real
Or is she tryin' to destroy the love that I feel


You're not the girl that stood beside me yesterday
You're not the girl that cared in that lovin' way
But now I wanna be in reality
And realize just what's happenin' to me
