Now that the love is gone

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone?

Love is gone

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone?

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone, love is gone

Now that the love is gone
What felt so right's so wrong
Now that the love is gone

I feel so hurt inside
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find the reason

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone?

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone, love is gone

Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold

Love, there's nothing left for us to say, yeah
Love, why can't we turn and walk away?

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone?

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone, love is gone

Love is gone
