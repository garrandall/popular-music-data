Said you're going with your boys today and 
"Don't worry cause I'll be home late"
But I know you're cheatin' out there, creepin',
You've been freakin' babe
So let me tell you how it's going to be
And you can run game but not on me boy
So who the hell are you trying to kid
You know this is what I did 

(change)
I called your pager and your two-way boy but no response
Start looking and I found you in some other women's arms
Don't try to front boy cause I saw you there with my own eyes
Just get your stuff boy cause I'm tired of hearing all your lies


Bounce baby out the door
I ain't gonna take this no more
Bounce baby out the door
Get up and move 
Don't make me act a fool
Just bounce


Baby boy I know you'll never find 
No stuff as good as mine
She can't work you like I did
You can look but you know I got that good shit
I know that you're hating it 
But you better stay with the one you're with 
You made your bed and now you have to sleep in it baby 
(change)


Wait a minute Sarah, give me a chance to explain
I was just talking to shorty, I don't even know her name
I ain't looking for no one to come and take your place
Ain't no one out there baby that can fill your space
No need to find a nickel got a dime at home
Plus I love every night the freaky way we bone
I ain't trying to get gone, ain't trying to play the roll
I'd rather stay and be a part of your green eyed soul
