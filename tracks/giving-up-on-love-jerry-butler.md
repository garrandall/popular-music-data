(Giving up, giving up)
(Giving up, giving up)

This is not the first time
It's happened before
Oh, the girl that I love
Doesn't love me anymore

So I've had it, forget it
Don't want it, you got it
I'm giving up on love
Before love gives up on me

(Giving up, giving up)
(Giving up, giving up)

How much can you give
And get nothing in return
And, oh, how long do you live
Before you finally learn

So I've had it, forget it
I don't want it
Brother, you've got it
I'm giving up on love
Before love gives up on me

(Giving up, giving up)
(Giving up, giving up)

Well, I've had it
Oh, forget it, I don't want it
Brother, you've got it
I'm giving up on love
Before love gives up on me

Yes, I am
I said I'm giving up today
Because love's given up on me
And gone away
