Somewhere...

Hey girl. help me if you can
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Give me love, I'm starved for affection
All I need is just a little direction

Wow
Somewhere in America,
somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America,
she waits for me

I need a teacher who can use a pet
Give me a lesson in etiquette
If there is anyone who'd like to try
Maybe she'd like to come and teach me tonight

Wow
Somewhere in America,
somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America,
she waits for me

Same old story, same old song and dance
What good is the glory, if you can't find romance
I know she is waiting
Oh, somewhere in the heartland
And if she's out there tonight
I wish she would raise her hand

Hey girl. help me if you can
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Give me love, I'm starved for affection
All I need is just a little direction

Wow
Somewhere in America,
somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America,
she waits for me

Somewhere in America
