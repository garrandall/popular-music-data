This bloody road remains a mystery
This sudden darkness fills the air
What are we waiting for?
Won't anybody help us?
What are we waiting for?


We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy
It's a do-or-die situation
We will be invincible


This shattered dream you cannot justify
We're gonna scream until we're satisfied
What are we running for?
We've got the right to be angry
What are we running for?
When there's nowhere we can run to anymore


We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy
It's a do or die situation
We will be invincible
And with the power of conviction
There is no sacrifice
It's a do-or-die situation
We will be invincible


Won't anybody help us?
What are we running for?
When there's nowhere, nowhere we can run to anymore


We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy
It's a do or die situation
We will be invincible
And with the power of conviction
There is no sacrifice
It's a do-or-die situation
We will be invincible


Yeah, oo-oh oh
Yeah, yeah
Oo-oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (we can't afford to be innocent)
Yeah, ohstand up and face the enemy)
(it's a do-or-die situation)
(We will be invincible)
Yeah (We can't afford to be innocent)
(Stand up and face the enemy)
(It's a do-or-die situation)
(We will be invincible)
