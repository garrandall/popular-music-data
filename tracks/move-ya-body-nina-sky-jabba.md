Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

All up in the club looking fly
Made your first approach
And caught his eye
Slowly move your way towards the dance floor
Grab her hand
And she whispered
Hold my hip
Got in the groove
Stand behind me
Let me grind with you
If I lick my lips
I'm prob'ly feeling you
Imma make you go oh

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Whoo (you feelin' it now)
Take it slow
Turn me on
Club gets warmer
Body moves closer
One with the rhythm
Don't stop moving
You're making me
HOT
From head to toe
I feel your flow
Vibe gets stronger
Party seems longer
Makes me really want'cha
Don't stop moving
You're making me
HOT

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Can you feel the beat?
Can you
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you
Can you feel the beat?

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?

Can you feel the beat?

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart?


Slow wind, slow wind, slow wind, slow wind
Fast wind, fast wind, fast wind, fast wind
Move your body, move your body, move your body, move your body

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Oh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go
