Oh, I guess this is the end of the line
My mind is completely made up
Oh, because only a fool would say
Knowing one day he might get hurt

But even when things for me
Was looking bad
Girl, I held my head up high

And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)
And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)

Could I forget you if I really tried
Or would I be loving you
Until the day I die

Oh, it seems like only yesterday
You said you loved me
But, girl, you went and hurt me
Over and over, yeah

Oh, but deep down inside
I know that I would lose your
Sweet loving in the end

But I plowed all my pride
Deep in my pocket
As I dried my tear filled eyes
And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)
And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)

Could I forget you if I tried
Or would I be loving you
Until the day I die

What you trying to do to me, baby
Oh, I love you
Don't do this to me, baby

Girl, you made me change my mind
You even made me
Turn back the hands of time

But I'll be right here
Holding on for your sweet loving, baby
All you got to do is tell me
That the waiting is not is vain
