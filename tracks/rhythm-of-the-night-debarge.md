When it feels like the world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness has got you going crazy
It's time to get out, step out into the street
Where all of the action is right there at your feet
Well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away
You'll be doing fine when the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget
So, come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, (oh baby, I'm crying)
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, (oh baby)
Forget about the worries on your mind

The music's playing
It's a celebration
The music's playing
Everybody dance to the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind, 'cause you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night...
