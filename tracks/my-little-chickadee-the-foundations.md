Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
(My little chickadee, I still love you)

Where in the world
Did I let you down
My little chickadee
When you were around
The world was sunny, seems funny now
(I lost you darlin' but I don't know how)

It used to be roses
It used to be wine
Two crazy people only havin' a time
Then out of the blue
It seemed to flicker and die
(Oh lordy how you kissed goodbye, hey hey hey)
You never tried to save me from the broken heart (hey hey hey)
All the time you told me that we'd never part

Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
(My little chickadee, I still love you)

Where in the world
Did I let you down
My little chickadee
When you were around
The world seemed sunny, all funny now
(I lost you darlin' but I don't know how)

It used to be love fires
And barbecue stew
And walks in the rain
A home we got soaked through
I thought you would always be happy with me
(oh lordy just how wrong can you be, hey hey hey)
I never saw this thing that came about you (hey hey hey)
I only know I'm lonely girl, without you

Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
(My little chickadee, I still love you)

Oh baby, yeah now
My pretty little chickadee
Everything is gonna be all right
Yes it will, yes it will now
