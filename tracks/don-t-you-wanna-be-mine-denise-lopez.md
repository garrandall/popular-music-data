Turn around, make your move
Turn around, make your move
Turn around, make your move

I can feel you staring, your eyes undressing me
Every time I'm near you boy, my heart skips a beat
Stop anticipating, don't play hide and seek
My love's for the taking if you're playing for keeps

Every little thing you do
Is saying that you want me, too
But you keep your heart behind the wall of ice
Every single breath you take
Is another second that you waste
I don't like the shy boys
Open up your eyes boy

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Nothing's wrong, just say you do
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine

Yeeah, do it now

Nothing comes from nothing, I won't give it away
I'm wonderin' if you love me, because you never say
Don't play with my passion, I can't read your mind
Boy let's see some action, show me some kind of sign

If I opened up my heart, would you even know where to start
Am I guessing wrong about your feelings?
Is it all a fantasy, that I think you wanna be?
Explain to my affection, have I got your attention?

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Nothing's wrong, just say you do
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine oh mine

Tell me where I'm goin' wrong
Have I been misled?
Is it something that I said?
Or didn't sa-aay-yaa-aay-yaa

Every little thing you do
Is saying that you want me, too
But you keep your heart behind the wall of ice
Every single breath you take
Is another second that you waste
I don't like the shy boys
Open up your eyes boy

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose

Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine

I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know you wanna be mine
I know, I know!

I know, you wanna be mine
I know, you wanna be mine
You wanna be mine, You wanna be mine
Uh!

Baby don't play, baby don't play
Baby don't play, don't play that way
Baby don't play, baby don't play
Baby don't play, don't play that way
Baby don't play, baby don't play
Baby don't play, don't play that way

I know you wanna be mine, right here

Chorus 2x

Make that move! Make that mooove!
Make that move with me boy!
Don't be shy!

Now wasn't that great, see?
