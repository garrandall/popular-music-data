Dominic

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Nic, goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

In the age when John Lackland
Was the king of England,
Our father, Dominix
Fought the Albigensians.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

One day a heretic
Led him through the brambles,
But our father, Dominic
By his own joy, converted him.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Without a camel or a coach,
He travelled Europe on foot,
Scandinavia and Provence,
In saintly poverty.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

He enflamed with ardor
Boys and girls of every school,
And by sowing the Word
He founded the Brother Preachers.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

In the home of Dominic and his brothers,
Bread started becoming scarce,
And two angels presented themselves,
Bearing two great golden loaves.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Dominic saw in a dream
The preachers of the whole world
Under the mantle of the Virgin
In great number assembled.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Dominic, my good Father,
Keep us simple and happy
By announcing to our brothers
The Way and the Truth.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.
