Packed up all the pain
Left the tears outside my door
And I'm not gonna be the one
Who's left out in the rain no more

I see it so clearly
The writing is on the wall
Tellin' me I'm gonna be
Alright after all

Now I open my eyes
And I finally wise, no, no
No fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
'cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin' on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

Oh-
Ohohoohhoh
No fool

No room for sad regrets
'cause the past is done and gone
And I've learned that it's time that makes you wise
And truth that makes you strong

You thought you were so cool
Pull the wool right over my heart
But now you see that you can't keep
This heart in the dark

'cause I see through your eyes
Won't be blind one more time, no, no
No fool no more

No fool no more (no fool, baby)
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time (no tears, baby)
'cause this time I'm wise (I'm wise)
To the game that's been goin' on (to the game, uh, uh)
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

Gonna pull my heart together
Gonna leave the past behind
Gonna get to somethin' better
Put you out of my mind, yeah

I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
I just want you to know
That I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool (no, no) no more
Not like before (not like before, baby)
Not the way (not the way) it used to be (oh, no?)
No fool no more (no, no, no, no, no)

No tears this time (no more tears)
'cause this time I'm wise (not cryin' for you, baby)
To the game that's been goin' on (whoa?)
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more (mmm, mmm, mmm, no)

No fool no more (no fool no more)
Not like before (not like before)
Not the way (no, no) it used to be (oh, ho, oh, ho, ho)
No fool no more

No tears this time (no tears this time, baby)
'cause this time I'm wise ('cause this time I'm wise, yeah)
To the game that's been goin' on (alright)
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more (no fool no more)

No fool (no fool) no more (no more)
Not like before (not like before)
Not the way (not the way) it used to be (it used to be)
No fool no more (ohoohhoh

No tears this time (baby, baby, baby)
'cause this time I'm wise (I can't waste my time on you, baby)
To the game that's been goin' on (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, uh-huh)
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool no more (no fool no more)
Not like before (not like before)
Not the way it used to be
