Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly


Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you


Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do


Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do


Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you


Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late


Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you


Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for you call, waiting for you call
I'm fed up, I'm tired waiting on you


Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
(So slowly...)
I don't know what to do


Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you


Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for you call, waiting for you call
I'm fed up, I'm tired waiting on you
