(Touch') Oh if someone writes a song with a simple rhyme
('N Sync) Just a song where his feeling show
(Scott Moffatt) And if someone feels the same about the simple
Song
(Gil Ofarim) Oh sometimes you can hear them say
(Squeezer) Music gives you happiness or sadness
(Nick Carter) But it also, it also heals your soul

(All) Chorus: Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power
To move any mountain

(Touch') Oh If someone plays piano with some simple chords
(Aaron Carter) So melodic and endearing, too
(Brian Littrell) And Oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano
(The Boyz) And maybe you can hear them sing
(Nick Carter) Music gives you happiness and sadness
('N Sync) But it also
(Blossom) Also heals your soul

(All) Chorus: Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power
To move any mountain

(Brian Littrell) Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul

(Nick Carter) Oooohh, Oh yes

(All) Chorus: Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control

(BSB)Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
