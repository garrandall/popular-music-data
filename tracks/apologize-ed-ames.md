In the fury of the moment
When the words of wrath rang out
When my mind was filled with questions
And my head was filled with doubt

I can still see sadness heartbreak
And the sorrow in your eyes
How can flowers live in darkness
How can I apologize

For the blackness I've created
In the world that used to shine
I have wilted all the roses
And I spoiled all the wine

Just get out your magic pencil
And erase the cloudy skies
Just draw a picture of me
Saying, I apologize

Give me back
The words I spoke in haste
Give em back
Or love will go to waste
Give em back

See the sunlight reappearing
Through the shrouds of darkened blue
As I hear the words forgiving
And watch the flowers bloom

And when time has lost that moment
And we mended broken ties
I will stay be on my knees
Saying, I apologize

Give me back
The words I spoke in haste
Give em back
Or love will go to waste
Give em back
