Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah


Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?


Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah


Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised  in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?


Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah


You know I'm always coming back to this place
You know and I'll say
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
You know


Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah


Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always coming back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
You know, and I'll say
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
