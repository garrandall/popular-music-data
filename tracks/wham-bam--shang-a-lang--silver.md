Starry nights, sunny days
I always thought that love should be that way
Then comes a time that you're ridden with doubt
You've loved all you can, now you're all loved out

Oh oh baby, we've been a long, long way
And who's to say where we'll be tomorrow?
Well, my heart says no but my mind says it's so
That we gotta love, is it a love to stay?

We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

Looking at you, I wanted to say
I think a little emotion goes a long, long way
Careful, now, you don't get caught in your dreams
Look out, baby, this is not what it seems

Oh oh baby, you've been so good to me
But please don't make it what it's not
Well, I thought we agreed on what we need
So, listen to me, I'll tell you what we've got

We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

I think you're seeing what I've been saying
Because I hear you singing to the tune I'm playing
Now that it's said and we both understand
Let's say our goodbyes before it gets out of hand

Bye bye, baby, I'd really like to stay
But we'll remember the best time in our life

We had a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
