Im looking for Blue Eyes, has anyone seen him?
Don't you tell me, he gave up on me
Im looking for blue eyes, I've got to find him
Oh something tells me, hes looking for me


There was a time when blue eyes said there was no other
His one and only love, he swore Id be
There was a time, when his blue eyes saw clearer than mine did
Storms and rain, tears and pain, bring me back his way

Im looking for Blue Eyes, has anyone seen him?
