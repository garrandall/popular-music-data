It's such a beautiful day that
The sky seems to say, "Good Morning"
Missed the dust off your shoes
Throw away ally our blues and start smiling

Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Upon your way

So, won't you decide
To come back alive
It's a new day

Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain

Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child

Well, I'm feeling so good
I keep knocking on wood
I'm not grieving

I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air
With a meaning

Saying it's time to wake up
Get a whole new outlook
From your view

Come on out
Where it's warm
It won't do any harm
If you want to

Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain

Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child

Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain

Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child
