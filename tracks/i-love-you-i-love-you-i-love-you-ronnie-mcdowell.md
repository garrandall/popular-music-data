(I love you, I love you, I love you)

(Chorus)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh tell me, please tell me, you love me too
I'll keep waiting and wondering until you do
I love you, I love you, I love you

These are such simple words
And I use them to scold her
And if the words should find their mark
Maybe they will pierce your heart

(Chorus)

(Instrumental)

Spoken:
Again I wish, that every time we pass by
Somewhere deep inside
Something I just can't hide
Begins to burn
And if you could feel
Then you could tell
What's burning is hotter than any fire could even begin to warm

So darling, can't you see
To set at ease to everything to me
And, day by day, my love will grow
The only thing is you don't know

(Chorus)

I love you, I love you, I love you
