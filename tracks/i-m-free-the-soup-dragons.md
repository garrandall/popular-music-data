Don't be afraid of your freedom
Freedom

I'm free
To do what I want
Any old time
I said I'm free
To do what I want
Any old time

I say
Love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
'Cause I'm free

To do what I want
Any old time
And I'm free
To be who I choose
Any old time

I say love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
'Cause I'm free

I say love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
'Cause I'm free

To do what I want
To be what I want
Any old time
And I'm free
To be who I choose
To get my booze
Any old time

I say love me
(Love me forever)
Hold me
(And love will never die)
Love me, hold me
'Cause I'm free

Do you hear what I say
These are the words me hear from my grandaddy
Come on
These are the words me hear from my grandaddy
Who say nothing in this world like when a man know he free
Free from the lackamissa (?)
Free from the dee (?)
Free like a butterfly
Free like a bee

These are the words me hear from my grandaddy
Said it's nice to be free
Nice to be free
Free from the lackamissa (?)
Free from the dee (?)
Don't be afraid of your freedom

'Cause I'm free
To do what I want
Any old time
(I'm a new creation)

'Cause I'm free
To do what I want
Any old time
(Don't be afraid of your freedom)

'Cause I'm free
To do what I want
To be what I want
Any old time
I said I'm free
To be who I choose
To get my booze
Any old time
