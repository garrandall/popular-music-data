It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

So please, play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

So please, play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
