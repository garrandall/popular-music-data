My new boy used to be a model
He looks way better than you
He looks way better than you
My new boy gets it how to get me
His love is deeper, you know
He's a real keeper, you know, oh

Bang, bang, bang I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that
Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
That's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out havin' fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

My new boy knows the way I want it
He's got more swagger than you
He's got more swagger than you do
My new boy really likes to flaunt this
He's not hiding me you know
He's showing me off you know

Bang, bang, bang I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that
Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
That's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out havin' fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

I hope you slip and fall and trip
All over my heart and just lay there alone
Yeah, you got what you wanted
On your hands and knees
Gasping for air, grasping for me
Baby don't hold your breath
I've moved on to the next

On to the next one
On to the next one

On to the next one
On to the next one

Bang, bang, bang I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that
Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
That's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out havin' fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

Bang, bang, bang I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that
Til I let him in
