To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)

I'd be good to him
I'd bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk along side of him

Yes, yes to know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)

Why can't he see
How blind can he be?
Someday he will see that he
Was meant for me
Oh, oh yes

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
