Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen


Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen


Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window, where you heading to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out the mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happenâ¦

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoaâ¦ Something bad
Whoaâ¦ Something bad


Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen


'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoaâ¦ Something bad
Whoaâ¦ Something bad

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoaâ¦ Something bad
Whoaâ¦ Something bad
