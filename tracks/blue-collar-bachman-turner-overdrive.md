Walk your street
And I'll walk mine
And should we meet
Would you spare me some time?
Cuz you should see my world,
Meet my kind, and before you judge our minds
Blue collar

Sleep your sleep
I'm awake and alive
I keep late hours
You're a nine to five
So I would like you to know
I need the quiet hours to create in this world of mine
Blue collar

I'd like you to know at four in the morning, things are comin' to mind
All I see, all I've done, and those I hope to find
I'd like to remind you at four in the morning my world is very still
The air is fresh under diamond skies, makes me glad to be alive

You keep that beat
And I keep time
Your restless face
Is no longer mine
I rest my feet while this world's in heat and I wish that you could do the same
Blue collar
