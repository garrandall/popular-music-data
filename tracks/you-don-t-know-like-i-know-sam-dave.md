You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning, she's my water
In the evening, she's my cup of tea


As long as I live
Wherever trouble lies
I go to her, and like a miracle
Everything just turns out right


You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
She brings her lovin' home now
Just the way it's supposed to be


What she want, she can get
Tender loving
Well, she's ready
Yeah, she's ready
Yeah, she's ready and willing


Just as long as I live
Wherever trouble lies
I go to her, and like a miracle
Everything just gets alright


You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning, she's my water
In the evening, she's my cup of tea


Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows like I know
You don't know (You don't know)
You don't know (You don't know)
You don't know
Nobody knows
They don't know, somebody tell 'em
They don't know
