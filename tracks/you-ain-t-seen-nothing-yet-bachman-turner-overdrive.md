I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Mmh, mmh, mmh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said


You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Nothin' yet, you ain't been around

And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said


You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something you're never gonna fff-forget, baby
You know, you know, you know, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
You need an education
Got to go to school

Any lovin' is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said


You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something
Here's a lover you're never forget, baby
Baby baby baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
You ain't been around


You ain't seen nothin' yet, that's what she told me
She said I need an education
Go to school
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
Mmh, mmh, mmh
You got something for me when I get home
Better be good
I been everywhere
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
But I deserve it one of these days
Woohoo, but I ain't seen nothin' yet
I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
I ain't seen nothin' yet
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
If you want to show me what I ain't seen, where I ain't been
Lalalalalala
Owowowowowowo
