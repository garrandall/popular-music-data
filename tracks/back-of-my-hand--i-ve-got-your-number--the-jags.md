You only call me if you're feelin' blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew just what I'm goin' through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you, girl

And when I call you I get stock replies
You work them out before you dry your eyes
I'm not a fruit machine, a 1960's dream
I dreamed about you last night, but you didn't see, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
You're not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish I knew that

I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number

I had a dream, I met another girl
But in the morning, she was just a kick inside
I hope I'm gettin' through the interference too
My money is running out, I don't know what to say now
The operator's saying "Cut the line"
You want to cut it for the very last time
You're only young at heart, but now's a time to start
Just realizing what I've got down here, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
You're not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish I knew that
(Only wish I knew that)

I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number

Say, don't you realize?
Is there nothing left inside?
Hey, did I get you wrong?
Say, where's your number gone?

You only call me if you're feelin' blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew just what I'm going through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
You're not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish I knew that
(Only wish I knew that)

I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number
