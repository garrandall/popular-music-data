Hey, yeah
She's sexy sexy sexy
She's sexy sexy sexy
I love the few pals
But the fellas whistle at my baby too loud
Because she's just, she's just sexy sexy sexy, ha
That's what she is now, uh, oh-wee
Sexy sexy sexy
Hey

Can't let her name ring
Because I know I got a thing
Don't watch her legs, can't watch her dress
You'll appreciate a sister than dig that mess
She's just sexy sexy, ha, that's what she is now
Sexy, hit me, hey, uh

Can't get enough
That makes me rough
Love me tender, good God
I know I'm tough

She got stallion hips
Got cheeks and lips
You see, a dog don't want a bone, ha
That's why he buries it
Don't talk about a thing I don't know about
But a right on stallion, that's what I got
'Cause she's just sexy, sexy
She's sexy sexy sexy, all right
Now baby, bring your good thing home
Now baby, bring your good thing home, all right

Soul sister, if you got a man, that need his job to be billed
Don't waste your time, ha, bring it to a man that will
If you a, sexy, sexy sexy sexy
Only, only, only if you're sexy, sexy, sexy sexy sexy, all right
Walk on with that soul power thigh
With that shape that keep me sanctified
Make me wanna spank, ha, oh Lord
Make me wanna spank
Be mellow and be sweet
Forget about the dice, sit down and cheat
Move the dead weight, you don't
'Cause the more I get, the more I want
Because she's, sexy, sexy sexy
Sexy, sexy sexy
Listen sister, if you got something to show let it show
If you got something to move, let it move
