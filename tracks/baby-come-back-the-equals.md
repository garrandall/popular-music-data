Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back

This is the first time until today
That you have run away
I'm asking you for the first time
Love me enough now to stay (all right)
Hey (all right)
Hey (all right!)
Hey, yeah

Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back

There ain't no use in you crying
'Cause I'm more hurt than you
I shoulda not been out flirting
But now my love is true
Ooh (all right)
Ooh (OK!)
Ooh, yeah

Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back

Come back, baby, don't you leave me
Baby, baby, please don't go
Oh, won't you give me a second chance?
Baby, I love you so (all right)
Oh (oh, yeah)
Oh
Oh, yeah

Come back
I said baby, come back
I said baby, come back
Oh won't you please come back
Oh won't you please come back
