What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What if


If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate, uh
Future with a dog named Ben
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name


But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if


Yeah, picture me on one knee
With the perfect diamond ring (perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, "Yes"
We'd have our wedding on the beach (oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this may sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name


But we can't (we can't), we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if


Don't know what tomorrow brings but I'm still hoping
That you are the one for me
Oh and what if I had you and what if you had me and
Baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if
What if
What if, oh, woah


But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo (yeah)
Baby, what if
But we can't (we can't), we can't (ooh) tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo (singing oh)
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
