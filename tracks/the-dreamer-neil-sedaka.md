The dreamer
Silly dreamer
They all call me
Since I met you

Every friend I have, girl
Called you bad girl
And they told me
To forget you
They said to me
Foolish little dreamer
Why can't you see
She's a fickle schemer
She'll take your heart
Thinking it's a joke
And break it apart
Laughing when it's broken, too

But I don't care
Because in my dream world you are my dream girl
So my prayer
Goes out to each little sheep to keep me asleep
The dreamer
Silly dreamer
They all called me
Soon they'll all see
They were wrong about you
Wrong to doubt you
Darling, we'll show them
How dreams come true
