Uh huh this my hit
All the girls stomp your feet like this
Few times I've been round that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit

I heard that you were talking trash
And you didn't think that I would hear it 
People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up 
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack 
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out 
That's right, put your pom-poms down, getting everybody fired up

Uh huh this my hit
All the girls stomp your feet like this
Few times I've been round that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit

So that's right dude, meet me at the bleachers 
No principals, no student-teachers
Both of us wanna be the winner, but there can only be one 
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all 
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to ya 
That's right, I'm the last one standing, another one bites the dust
Uh huh this my hit
All the girls stomp your feet like this

Few times I've been round that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit

Let me hear you say, this beat is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
This beat is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
Again this beat is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
This beat is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!

Few times I've been round that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
This my hit, this my hit
