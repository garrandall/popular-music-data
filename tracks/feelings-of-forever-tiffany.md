If there was no tomorrow
Then tonight would never end
If we could freeze the hands of time
I would stay here in your arms
And not go back again

'Cause all I want is for you to hold me now
And we can make it through this night together
And all I need is for you to show me how
'Cause nothing can stop this feeling of forever

I've never felt this close enough
Lying here face to face
Far beneath the silver sky
And there's no one around
To chase this night away

'Cause all I want is for you to hold me now
And we can make it through this night together
Oh, and all I need is for you to show me how
'Cause nothing can stop this feeling of forever

The world is ours tonight
As long as we just believe
The feelings that we hold inside
Are in every heart that beats
And these feelings of forever...

Oh, and all I want is for you to hold me now
(Is for you to hold me now)
And we can make it through this night together
(What we got is the feeling of forever)
And all I need is for you to show me how
(All I want is for you, is for you to hold me, yeah)
'Cause nothing can stop this feeling or forever
