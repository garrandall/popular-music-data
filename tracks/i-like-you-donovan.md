You're such a good friend
I'd had to have you as an enemy
From the first time we met
I knew you were the one to set me free

You liked me. I liked you
You liked me. I liked you

Holding my heart in the palm of your hand
Headed out west for the Indian lands
Dreams of the golden boy tangling your mind
Burning your body to fill in the time

Sad city sister on Avenue of Palm
I knew naively that I was your man
I followed after with heavy heart of lead
Just like a man who walks, yet is dead

I asked you to dance
And you wondered and you thought you might
So we went and took a chance
On the catwalk in the cold starlight

I held you. You felt me
I touched you. You kissed me

Holding my heart in the palm of your hand
Headed out west for the Indian lands
Dreams of the golden boy tangling your mind
Drugs aid your body to fill in the time

Sad city sister on Avenue of Palm
I knew naively that I was your man
I followed after with heavy heart of lead
Just like a man who walks, yet is dead
