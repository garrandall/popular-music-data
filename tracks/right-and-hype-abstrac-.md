Right, the hype
Right, the hype...

Right, hype
Right, hype, yeah
Right, hype
Right, hype

I've been looking for a
I've been looking for the right guy
I've been searching here and there
But there still was no one there
For me, for me

There's nothing so sweeter
There's nothing so fine
Than to have a girl like me

One who's so precious
One who's so dear
I need a man and he's
Got to be right

Right, hype
Who can love me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
One who's so real
Right, hype
Who knows the deal

No need to play me out
No need to shout
All I ask for someone
Who can work it out

So, let's get together
Let's have some fun
Hey, let's not push it
But, baby, you're the one

You know I'm not crazy
Let's give it a try
I need a man and he's
Got to be right

Right, hype
Someone who
Loves me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
Someone who's so real
Right, hype
Who knows the deal
Yeah, yeah...

The hype...
He's got to be hype
He's got to be

Right, hype
Who can love me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
Someone who's so real
Right, hype
Who knows the deal
Yeah, yeah...

Right, hype
Who can love me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
Someone who's so real
Right, hype
Who knows the deal
Yeah, yeah...

Right, hype
Right, hype
I need someone to talk to
Right, hype
Hey, oh
Right, hype
He's got to be

Right, hype
Who can love me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
Someone who's so real
Right, hype
He's got to be right
