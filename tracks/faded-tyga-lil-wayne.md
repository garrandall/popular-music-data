I'll 'nail' it, 'hammer' time, but you fuckers cannot 'stop' this
Man of 'Steal' up in this ho like I fuck her, never 'bought this.'
I got this, got your fuckin' daughter screamin' I'm the hottest
I 'fuckin' make it 'Rainn', like I'm 'cummin' out 'The Office.'
The rawest and that's a fact, you 'sleep' on me, you're 'lying.'
You changed your true colors, bitch, but somehow you're not 'dying.'
You wanna be the next big thing, but you rappers are not trying
Why the fuck would I stay grounded when I could be flying?
Defying gravity, blessed like I got allergies
Got these motherfuckers mad at me, cause the way I casually ravage beats
This is far from "average, neat," you rap lames fucking lack this heat
Like the way that I attack this beat and the high rate of them casualties!
Fatality, bitch, and I'm coming to your families
Motherfuck reality, y'can catch me in your galaxy
Disregard formalities, a savage beast on wild beats!
The real walking 'paradox,' you can call me 'Kyle Reese!'


The only reason I can rap is cause I have no fucking life
I used that shit to my advantage, like a lying user wife
All I do is watch Netflix, blog, eat, homework, and fucking write
You can call me 'SOPA,' cause I'll destroy all that is on 'site!'
Oh my Zod, he's fucking clever, find someone that can spit better
Bet I sever, never better. Alec's on a hard endeavor
Under weather, yes, I'm sick. "Shut the fuck up, with that sick bull shit
Every song you mention it. You sound like you are full of it."
I keep my head held high, I guess that's why I'm stuck up
Your porno's on, your parents here, mute that so shut the fuck up!
Catch me up in Asgard asking Odin, "What's up?"
While I got villains in the corner coughing blood up
A child? Please, I guess that's true, but I like the way I'm wilding
I'm a fucking 'square,' I'm 'groundbreaking,' it is like I'm 'tiling'
I defile beats, just smile please, need clean up here at aisle three!
Fuck what you heard and 'fuck the past,' call me 'Kyle Reese.'
