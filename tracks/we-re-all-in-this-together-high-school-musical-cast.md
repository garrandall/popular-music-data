The summer that we wanted


Yeah, we finally got it!


Now's the time we get to share


Each day we'll be together


Now until forever


So everybody, everywhere


Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together


Let's celebrate today
There'll never be another


We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other


Everything's just right


Everybody all for one
The real summer has just begun!
Let's rock and roll and just let go
To the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Everybody, one for all and all for one!
All for one, one!


Summertime together


Now we're even closer


That's the way it's meant to be


Oh, we're just getting started


Come and join the party


You deserve it, same as me


Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together


Let's celebrate today cause there'll never be another


We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other


Everything's just right


Everybody all for one
The real summer has just begun!
Let's rock and roll and just let go
To the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Everybody, one for all and all for one!
All for one, one!


Everybody up!


Everybody rock it!


Take it from the top!


And never ever stop it!


It's not about the future


It's not about the past


It's makin' every single day
Last and last and last!
Fun and sun
What could be better?
Let's have fun
Everyone together now!
Everybody, e-everybody now!
This is where our summer really begins
The very last time it's ever gonna be like this
It's the party you don't wanna miss!


Guys!
Show 'em we can make some moves, hey!


Girls!
Show 'em we know how to groove, oh!


Here


And now!


Let's turn the party


Out!


Everybody jump in!


Everybody all for one
The real summer has just begun!
Let's rock and roll and just let go
To the rhythm of the drums
We're going to have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Everybody, one for all
Everybody all for one
Let's rock and roll and just let go
To the rhythm of the drums
We're going to have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Come on, everyone let's dance!
We can't let this moment pass!
Let's make this party last!
All for one!
All!
For!
One!
