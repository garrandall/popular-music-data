Fight!
Hey
Goddamn... I'm winnin'
Goddamn! I'm winnin', I'm winnin'
God
Got money, now you done switched up on me


I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me


Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me


Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by Gawd Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (One up)


Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('Cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers


Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me


This the shit I don't condone in
Cheatin' on your man but you can get it if you want it
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga takin' shots, send 'em back, check the postage, yeah
Hatin' ass nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up
And every time I'm back in the city
Every bitch with a hidden agenda run up (Cause I'm on, nigga)


Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('Cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers


Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me


Every nigga did you wrong, except for me
I'm next to blow and so you should've been next to me
Say you lovesick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no
(Boy, if you don't get!)


Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('cause I'm on witcha)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers


Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me


Hey
Goddamn
Hey
We don't like gold diggers...
Goddamn I'm winnin', I'm winnin'
Goddamn I'm winnin'
Oh no!
