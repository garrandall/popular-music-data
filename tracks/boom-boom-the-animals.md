Boom boom boom boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
Love that is true
Boom boom boom boom


I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
When you walk that walk
And you talk that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet


C'mon and shake (Shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (Shake it baby)
C'mon now baby (Shake it baby)
I don't mean maybe (Shake it baby)
You're driving me crazy (Shake it baby)
C'mon, c'mon (Shake it baby)


C'mon and shake (Shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (Shake it baby)
Yeah, shake (Shake it baby)
I don't mean maybe (Shake it baby)
You're driving me crazy (Shake it baby)
C'mon, c'mon (Shake it baby)
All right, all right
Come on, baby


The way you walk
The way you talk
When you walkin' that walk
And talkin' that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
I need you right now
I mean right now
Come on, come on
Come on, shake it up baby


C'mon and shake (Shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (Shake it baby)
C'mon now baby (Shake it baby)
C'mon now baby (Shake it baby)
Come on and shake (Shake it baby)
Alright, alright


C'mon and shake (Shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (Shake it baby)
C'mon and shake (Shake it baby)
Shake, shake, shake (Shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (Shake it baby)
Come on, baby
All right, all right
