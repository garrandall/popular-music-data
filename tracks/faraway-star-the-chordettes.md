Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight

Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
I can get dizzy
Just looking above
You are as far
As my faraway love

Faraway love, faraway love
Who can be happy
With faraway love

Wish that I may
Wish that I might
Grant me the wish
That I'm wishing tonight

Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
I can get dizzy
Just looking above
You are as far
As my faraway love

Once must he seem
Distant from me
Even when we are
As close as can be

Powerful star
Wonderfully wise
Let me be seen
By his faraway eyes

When I am near
When I am near
Couldn't he be more
Aware that I'm here

We're holding hands
Inches apart
Show me the way
To his faraway heart

Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
I can get dizzy
Just looking above
You are as far
As my faraway love

Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
