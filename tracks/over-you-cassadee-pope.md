Weather man said it's gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
Mid-February shouldn't be so scary
It was only December I still remember
The presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you

Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along with every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in you know
When I see it in stone

Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you
Ever get over you
