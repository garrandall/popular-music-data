Trust in me oh trust

Trust in me
In all that you do
Have the faith
That I have in you
Love will see
Us through
As long as you trust in me
Trust in me

Come to me
When things go wrong
Plead to me
And I'll be strong
We can get
Along
As long as you trust in me

While there's a moon on high
While there's a bird to fly
While there's a you you and I
You can be sure I love you

Stand beside
Me all of the while
Face the future
Face it with a smile
Trust in me
And I'll be worthy of you

Trust in me
And I'll be worthy of you
Trust in me (I'll be worthy of you)
Trust in me (I'll be worthy of you)
Trust in me (I'll be worthy of you)
Trust in me (I'll be worthy of you)
