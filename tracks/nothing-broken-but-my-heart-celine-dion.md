I've been over you for some time now baby
I don't miss your kiss like before now anymore now
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'm fine
All I needed was a little time
So if you still think that I still need you Baby 
I really don't know why
Oh baby, since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

You won't find no tears in my eyes now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask I'll say I'm happy I'm free
Tell you that's the way I wanna be
And all those nights we shared together baby
We'll they don't mean a thing

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that 
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

So if you still think that I need you baby
I don't think about you
I'm happy now without you

Oh baby, you might think my world's been torn apart Oh but you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

Oh baby since you left me 
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart
Nothing broken, nothing broken but my heart

Baby, you might thing my world's been torn apart
But nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart, , ,
