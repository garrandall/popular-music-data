Who's my number one girl?
Who's my number one girl?

Where she go?
Where she at?
That's my girl, got my back
When I need her, always there
Hold me down, like no one else
When stupid boys come around
Me and my girls shut em down
Nobody can stop us now
Gonna take 'em, we run this town
All night long

If you got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that

You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't got to worry never,
You're my best friend for life

I'm your number one girl, I'm your best friend
And I'll always be there, right till the end
Sophia Grace got your back, just know that
And that's the reason why I'm rappin' on this hot track
I'll took it to the top, I'm never gonna stop
Eleven years old, that's just how I rock
So if you're my best friend put your hands up, now put your hands up

If you got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that

You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't got to worry never,
You're my best friend for life

And if the world's against us,
And if your back's against the world together
No one to defend us, no one to defend us
We're gon' make through singing like we do
We gon' laugh at them boys when they talk to us
But they can't get in, we get so annoyed
When they don't understand No it means no, no, no, no
We don't want no boys 'round here
No, we don't want no boys 'round here
We don't want no boys 'round here
No boys, no no

You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't got to worry never,
You're my best friend for life
You're my best friend forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You ain't got to worry never,
You're my best friend for life

It's my number one girl
It's my number one girl
