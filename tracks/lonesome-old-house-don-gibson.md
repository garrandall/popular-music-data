In this lonesome old house
In this lonesome old house

Listen to the clock
A-going tick-tock
Listen to the rain
On the window pane
Everything's quiet
Quiet as a mouse
In this lonesome old house
In this lonesome old house

Everything's dark
Dark outside
Stars don't shine
In the sky
Here I sit
No one about
In this lonesome old house
In this lonesome old house

All the love and laughter and sunshine
Left when she said goodbye
There's no longer the sweet, sweet lips
And that lovin'
That sweet lovin' smile
So let it be said
If your love is true
You be good to her
She'll be good to you
And don't you end up
Being without
In a lonesome old house
In a lonesome old house
