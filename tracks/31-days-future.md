Zaytoven
Every now and then, you know what I'm sayin'
Most of them, majority of the time
You dig
We in that mode

This is a moment of clarity
Everything VV's, I'm gone to the maximum
Young nigga flood out a 'axima, flawless the face, then run through a pack of them
Everything classical, everything magical when they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah
The pill on the caliber
Put on the passenger
Whatever time, wherever I was at
Look on the calendar, yeah we compatible
I have her flying where ever I'm at
You astronomical, way too phenomenal to not have her naked where I land
I got a second option, and fourth and fifth one whereever a nigga staying
I had it falling right out of my pocket when I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin'
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France
She caramel, what'd I get a tan
I need to pay her when I get the chance
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash
Talkin' that shit, he get smoked like a blunt
Took a few Pakistanians to lunch
Got some little slim shit in Milan
These niggas be hatin', putting on a front

Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse, when I got it in her mouth she couldn't breath
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil schlong on my teeth
I done took a little E, I fucked her and made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm paying this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page

Doing it on a chinchilla, oh yeah
We fucking a couple of strippers together
Shawty my rider, she down for whatever
Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the c's
I'm on a whole 'other level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they could all come and sleep with us
We do nothing that is normal, everything we do is super gigantic
We don't put on fugazi, everything we wear super Titanic
I just caught me a wave, feel like a nigga that jumped in the Atlantic
One hell of a car collection, pulling it up, it's panoramic
Picked her up in a Cayenne, soon as she got in she got nothing on

Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse, when I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil schlong on my teeth
I done took a little E, I fucked her, made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm paying this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
