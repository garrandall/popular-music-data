Every nigga out there wanna be down with the crew
Some ain't got enough heart, let me ask you this
Would ya be down like a soldier
Loyal an' do everything I told ya

I can mold ya into a warrior, down for your neighborhood
Workin' up to a G with the flava
Criminal behavior, on the mind
When I got ya back ya know I got ya back each an' every time

Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care

It's time to exit that busta nigga
Get ya hands out ya pockets an' your finga on the trigga
Let one fly, we don't die, we multiply
Throw yo' set up in the sky

I ask you can 'cause you can't fuck wit this
Nigga when I got the glock ya betta duck quick
'Cause I ain't havin' it, if ya got ya gat
Ya betta start grabbin' it, I can handle it

Soy numero uno, mero mero
You know I run wit Muggs an' the Perro
Firin' up that heater
When I'm throwin' up a set I got my nina millimeter

Los Scandalous, Killafornia, where I'm from
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum
I'm buckin' on ya ass now ya know where I'm from
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum

Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care

Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care

Let me take ya to the dark side of the moon
Tell mama that you won't be comin' home anytime soon
'Cause I got ya under my thumb, nigga, what set ya claimin'?
Betta be the same set I'm claimin'

Take a look around, count this amount of soldiers
When I'm chillin' on the east side of town
An' it won't stop 'til I'm done
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum

Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care

Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air
Wave it around like you just don't care
