What's the use in a pocket full of miracles
You gotta find them on rainy day
I believe in the power of the universe
Like a river gonna take you today

Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free

Back to back, it's only just beginning
Lord it feels so good
Gonna take ya today

He got his lady and she's sitting on a bull frog
Watching all the fishes just swimmin' away

Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free

Back to back, it's only just beginning
Lord it feels so good
Gonna take ya today

He got his lady and she's sitting on a bull frog
Watching all the fishes just swimmin' away

Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free

River road
River road
River road
River road
