It's funny how I find myself
In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose
One half won't do


I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?


It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends (it never ends)


Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose


Oh, I'd tell myself
What good do you do
Convince myself


It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends (it never ends)

And I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?


Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (it never ends)


Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (it never ends)


Oh, it's my life (oh it's my life)
Don't you forget (don't you forget)
Caught in the crowd (caught in the crowd)
It never ends (it never ends)
