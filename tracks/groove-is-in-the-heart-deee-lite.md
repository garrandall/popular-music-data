(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance and have some fun)


(Dig!)


The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)
I couldn't ask for another (Uh huh, uh huh)

No, I couldn't ask for another




Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (Astronomical)
Groove is in the heart
(Watch out)


The depth of hula groove
Moves us to the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another



Unh, some looks in this torso (yeah)
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know (wanna know)
Delightful, truly delightful (lightful)
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show (show)
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze (haze)
Music makes motion, moves like a maze (maze)
All inside of me, side, heart especially (yeah)
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be (c'mon)
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes (eyes)
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize (yeah)
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key (yeah)
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the street when I hear a funk beat (bloop)
Playin' Pied Piper, follow what's true
Baby, just sing about the groove!
*Sing it*


Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart

(One, two, three)


Blow them horns along
(The groove is in your heart)


Groove is in the heart (yeah)
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart


Hm
He he he he
C'mon, y'all deep
Y'all are crazy, man
