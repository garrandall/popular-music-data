The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
I couldn't ask for another
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
Wah wah wah wah...

Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah

The depth of hula groove
Moves into the tenth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a who...
I couldn't ask for another
I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another

Some looks in this torso
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know?
The live of truely delightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze
All inside of me, heart especially
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be

Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah

1, 2, 3, go!

Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart, wah wah wah
