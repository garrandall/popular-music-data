Did I tell you how much I miss
Your sweet kiss?
Did I tell you I didn't cry?
Well I lied
I lie lie lied
Over real over
When I nearly hit the face I loved
So tired of packaging the anger
Always pushing you away

Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you yes I do
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
Cos you're wonderful yeah

Did I tell you how much I miss
Your smile?
Did I tell you I was okay?
Well no way
No way way way

You're wonderful yeah yeah

Now now now each and every day
I realize the price I have to pay
You you're wonderful
And now for your information
I'm walking around like an arm decoration

You you're wonderful
So high I can't get over it
So deep I can't get under it
You
You're wonderful yeah
You're wonderful yeah yeah
You're wonderful yeah yeah
You're wonderful yeah yeah
Wonderful

Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you yes I do
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
For so long long long
