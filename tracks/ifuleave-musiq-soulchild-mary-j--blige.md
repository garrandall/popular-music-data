You think I'm so full of it, full of it
But I think I'm just fed up baby
You think I can be so arrogant, arrogant
But I'm just tryna keep my head up baby

You think I procrastinate baby
But I think I'm taking my time
You think you need to leave
But I think I disagree

But if you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try

If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But I have no doubts
We can work it out


I think you're so full of it, full of it
You just don't know when to let up, baby
I think you're so arrogant, arrogant
But you think you're so much better baby

That I think it ain't healthy for me
To judge you by your flaws and that's why
I know I could criticize
But I put that aside
To focus on you and I

But if you believe you'll do best without me
Then I'll let it go boy, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try

If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go boy, it's over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out


Now if you wanna go
Baby then I'll let you go
And even though I'm tryna hold on
I can't if you don't

Go now if you need me
You're gonna miss me
And I'm not saying
That I'll be here waiting

Since we're here right now
Instead of just walking out
Let's work to reach the point I know that we could be

But if you believe, you'll do best without me
But I'll let it go girl
 I'll just go, then just go girl
 But I'll let it go
It's over (it's over)
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try

If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But I have no doubt
That we can work it out

If you believe, you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try

If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl
I don't wanna hold you
It's over
I'm not here to hold you
But I have no doubts
I just wanna love you and hold you
We can work it out
It's OK
