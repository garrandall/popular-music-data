Seems like everybody's waitin' for the new change to come around
Come around, come around, come around
Waitin' for the day when the king, queen of shows singing 'round
Singing' round, singing round, singing round
Singing round, singing round for everyone
Yeah do it

You can understand everything's to share
Let your spirits dance brothers everywhere
Let your head be free
Turn the wisdom key
Find it naturally
See you're lucky to be
If you're sad just spin around and round and round
Do it

Yes just hold me baby
Something on your back
Lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Don't you know honey maybe
You're like my childless hometown
This ole town, this ole town, this ole town
Sing it now
Time for you to all get down
Yeah do it

Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready

Dig this sound
Spinnin' round and round and round
Do it

You can understand everything's to share
Let your spirits dance brother everywhere
Let your head be free
Turn the wisdom key
Find it naturally see, your lucky to be
Sing it now
Time for you to all get down
Yeah do it

Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready

Sing it now
Time for you to all get down
