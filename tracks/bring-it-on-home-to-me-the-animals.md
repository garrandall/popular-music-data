If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, oh yeah

You know I laughed, when you left
But now I know I've only hurt myself
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'll give you jewelry, money too
And that's not all, all I'll do for you
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know I'll always be your slave
Until I'm dead and buried in my grave
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
