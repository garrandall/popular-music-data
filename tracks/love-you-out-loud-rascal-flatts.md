I have always been a little shy 
I've always been the quiet type till now 
And I never let my feelings show 
I never let anybody know 
Just how much I was so deep in love 
But now that you're in my arms 


I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop 
Baby, scream and shout 
I wanna sing it on the radio, show it on a video 
Baby, leave no doubt 
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about 
I love to love you out loud 

You keep bringing out the free in me 
What you do to my heart just makes me melt 
And I don't think I can resist 
But I've never been one to kiss and tell 
A love this true can't be subdued 
So I'm gonna let out a yell 




Baby, I want the whole world to see 
Just how good your love looks on me 



Baby, I love to love you out loud 
Yeah, I love to love you out loud
