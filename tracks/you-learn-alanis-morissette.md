Mmh
I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone, yeah
Mmh
I recommend walking around naked in your living room, yeah
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
Woah, yeah, yeah
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You just call out my name (Out my name)
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
You live, you learn (I'll come running)
You love, you learn (To see you again)
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn (Winter, spring, summer or fall)
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn (And I'll be there, yeah)
All you have to do is call (You've got a friend)
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them
Woah, yeah, yeah (You just call out my name)
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You just call out my name (Just call, just call)
And you know wherever I am (Wherever I am)
I'll come runnin' (You live, you learn)
To see you again (You love, you learn)
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
(You bleed, you learn) (Winter, spring, summer or fall)
You scream, you learn (All you have to do is call)
(You just call out my name) You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
(You just call out my name) You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn
You grieve, you learn (You've got a friend)
You choke, you learn
You laugh, you learn (You've got a friend)
You choose, you learn (Oh, yes I will) (You've got a friend)
You learn (Kurt: Oh, yes I will)
You've got a friend
It's good to know (Ain't it good to know)
You've got a friend (You've got a friend)
It's good to know
You've got a friend
