I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Yeah, oh
I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room
Yeah


Swallow it down (What a jagged little pill)
It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles


You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream you learn


I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone
I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free


Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears


You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn


Wear it out (The way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (You're gonna have to eventually anyway)
The fire trucks are comin' up around the bend


You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn
You grieve, you learn
You choke, you learn
You laugh, you learn
You choose, you learn
You pray, you learn
You ask, you learn
You live, you learn
