Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
So many things to say
I could fit 'em in a book
Fit 'em in a book of a thousand pages, yeah
So many people say
That I couldn't tell a lie
Couldn't tell a lie in a thousand ages
Baby you're wrong
Baby you're wrong
Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
I look at your pretty face
And I fall in love with you
Fall in love with you everytime I see you, yeah
Nightgowns of regal lace
That are flowin' to the ground
Flowin' to the ground in a mist around you
Baby you're wrong
Baby you're wrong
Baby you're wrong
Baby you're wrong
Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
Ba da da da da da da
I can't find the time to tell you
Ba da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da
