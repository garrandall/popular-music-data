When you said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said, "There'd be no sorrow that I'd laugh
When you walked away"

But a little bitty tear let me down
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not to make a frown
But a little bitty tear let me down

I said, "I'd laugh when you left me full of funny
As you went out the door"
That I'd have another one a waitin'
I'd wave goodbye as you go

But a little bitty tear

Everything went out like I planned it
And I really put on quite a show
I thought that I was gonna stand it
But when you've got through the door

But a little bitty tear
When you said you were leaving
