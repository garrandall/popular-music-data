Yeah I'm chilling on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires


Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
You better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking man y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'


Yeah I'm chilling on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires


Man Iâm feeling like a million dollars
Stacked up all hundred dollar bills
Got a whole six-pack on ice
But Iâm ridinâ on the hottest wheels,
Seat back and I'm perwin' swervin'
Put my pedal to the metal like I'm racing
Turn it up and let the speakers scream for Mr. Aldean
But I call him Jason
Reminiscing on the good times
Water balloons, super soakers
Wet T-shirts, women in bikinis
Kenny Rogers penny loafers.
Smoke blowin' out the window
And all my problems aside
Just feel that summer breeze,
Lay back, kick it and enjoy the ride.


Yeah I'm chilling on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires
That's right...

Yeah I'm chilling on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires
(Kick it and enjoy the ride)
That's right...
