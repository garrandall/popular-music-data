I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for

We had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart, and achin' head, and no regrets

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Is this love
Or could it be
