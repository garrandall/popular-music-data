Tell me where are you going
Sweet mademoiselle
To London or Paris
To the Grand Hotel

Where do you go at the end of the day
Where do you go, when you spend time away
To islands in the tropic sands
Or pleasure trips to distant lands
You're searching for a dream
Well maybe it's me.

I tell you hello
And what do you say
As I stop you go
There's no reason to stay

It all began so harmlessly
You gave me love so easily
I never realized you were just spending time

Tell me where are you going
Sweet mademoiselle
To London or Paris
To the Grand Hotel

Even though you're far away
I think about you every day
And wonder if you're thinking of me
In a fond memory
Sweet mademoiselle

Tell me where are you going
Sweet mademoiselle
To London or Paris
Ou Montreal
Sweet Mademoiselle
