I left you this morning couldn't take anymore
You laughed and you dared me to walk out the door
You said that I'd come back you knew what I'd do
And you know you were right cause I'm back here tonight begging to you

I won't disappoint you I'm begging to stay
That's what you wanted to hear anyway
It must make you happy to make me so blue
What a pityful sight I must be tonight begging to you

You don't want my loving but you let me stay around
I guess just to walk on so you won't touch the ground
To you it don't matter what you cause me to do
As long as you keep me begging to you

What a pityful sight I must be tonight begging to you

Oh don't want my loving but you let me stay around
I guess just to walk on so you won't touch the ground
To you it don't matter what you cause me to do
As long as you keep me begging to you
As long as you keep me begging to you
