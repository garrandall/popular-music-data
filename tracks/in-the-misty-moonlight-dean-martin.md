In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you

In a far away land
On a tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on a mountain
Way down in a valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place anywhere
I don't care

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you
In a far away land
On a tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on a mountain
Way down in a valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place anywhere
I don't care
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight....
