Somebody told me a long, long time ago
O baby, I feel a change in me
Is comin' on
I've found the strength I need
To carry on
Something's come over me at last

Sweet darlin', long as you stay by me
I'm halfway home
I can see brighter days before me
Tho' it's been stormy
At least I know I'm not alone

'Cause there's just too many people
In this world
Who are undecided
There's just too many broken people
Afraid to take a stand
There's just too many lonely people

Livin' in a house divided
By loneliness and sorrow
I'll never understand

Somebody told me a long, long time ago
Remember when you need something to believe in
Look in my eyes to find your heaven
I'll make it happen
I need to know you're there

'Cause there's just too many people
In this world
Who are undecided
There's just too many broken people
Afraid to take a stand
There's just too many lonely people
Livin' in a house divided
By loneliness and sorrow
It's more than I can stand
