I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain
And the touch of a hand and the way she said: 'Goodbye'.

And we walked in the sun down the royal mile
Saw the light in her eye and the way she smiled
And she cried in the night and I heard her say: 'Don't go'.

What can I do, sweet darlin'? I don't want to go away
Looking at you, sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?

And the light of the day I was rolling home
I was thinking of you waiting on your own
And I wanted to call but they sudden said: 'Oh no'.

Yeah, but now it's a dream, it's a memory
But I'll never forget what you gave to me
I was lost and alone but you made feel OK.

What can I do, sweet darlin'? I don't want to go away
Looking at you, sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?

I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain
And the touch of a hand and the way she said: 'Goodbye'.

What can I do, sweet darlin'? I don't want to go away
Looking at you, sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?
