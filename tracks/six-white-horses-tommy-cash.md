Mhm some folks drink and some folks smoke and some folks love and some folks don't
Some folks laugh and some folks frown folks hear then they gun you down
Goodbye John six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye John they took you away before you sang your song hm
Some preach wrong and some preach right and some preach love and some preach fight
Takes every kind to make that world go round takes one to gun you down
Goodbye Martin six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Reverend they took you away before you sang your song hm
Some people stick pretty close to home others're born with that urge to roam
Welcome welcome to our town hope nobody tries to gun you down
Goodbye Bobby six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Robert they took you away before you sang your song hm
Goodbye John and goodbye Martin and goodbye Bobby
Well they took you away before you sang your song
