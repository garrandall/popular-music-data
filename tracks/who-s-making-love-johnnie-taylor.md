All you fellows, gather round me
And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheatin' on your woman
There is something you never even thought of
And that is:
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
I've seen so, so many fellows
All in that same old bag
Thinkin' that a woman is made to
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you somethin'
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of
And that is:
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
I know that other women
Give the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life
Boy, that's up to you, oh you
Oh oh, you you
Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened
Something I never ever dreamed of
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love
Now, who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
