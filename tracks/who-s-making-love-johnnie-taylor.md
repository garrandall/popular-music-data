Well everybody, gather 'round me
Let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, what I'm gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheating on your woman
There's something you never even thought of, and that's

Who's making love to your sweet baby
While you were out making love
Who's making love to your sweet baby
While you were out making love

I've seen so, so many love us
Fall in that same old trap

Thinking that your baby is made to,
To beat, lie, do and treated so bad
Oh, let me ask who's something
I'm sure you never even dreamed of, yeah

That's who's making love to your sweet baby
While you were out making love
Isay, who's making love to your sweet baby
While you were out making love

I know there are some love you, give a pretty good excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life, honey it's up to you
Oh, you oh, you
Ah, you

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up, oh
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened, yeah
Something I never, never ever dreamed of

Somebody was-a lovin', oh yeah, my baby
While I was out making love
Somebody was-a lovin' my sweet honey
While I was out making love
Who's making love (sweet baby)
Who's making love
Who's making love
Somebody else was loving my baby (my sweet baby)
While I was out, out making love
Oh, my baby
Oh, my baby (my sweet baby)
Who's making love
Who's making love
Who's making love
Who's making love (my sweet baby)
To your sweet baby (making love)

Oooh
