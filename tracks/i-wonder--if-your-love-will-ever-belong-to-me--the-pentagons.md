I wonder if your love
Will ever belong to me,
When a voice from deep
Within keeps talking,
And it's telling me.
That a girl with such a heart,
Can only tear my dreams apart,
But I love you dear and
I don't care what it says.

A voice within my heart
Says to find another love
But how can I, my dear,
Cause I know it's only you I love
And I don't believe a word,
Not a single thing I've heard
And my love is yours
Until my dying day.

Someday, when you're feeling fine,
Then I'll say to you "It's you I really love".
And somehow I'll make you mine
And you'll cling to me like a girl in love.

A voice within my heart
Says to find another love,
But how can I, my dear,
Cause I know it's only you I love
And I don't believe a word
Not a single thing I've heard
And my love is yours
Until my dying day.

I wonder if your love
Will ever belong to me...
