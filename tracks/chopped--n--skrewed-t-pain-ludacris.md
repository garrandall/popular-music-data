Yayyy! Yeah-yeahhh
Whoahhhhhhhh
Uhh, now, now shorty
Now, now, now shorty
Now-now, now shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
Shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
Shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
Yeahhhh, yeahhh yeahhh


Have you ever seen
A dimepiece all alone at the bar (bar, bar)
Straight out of a magazine
And you just wanna let her know who you are (are, are)
So you say "Let me buy you a drink or a lil' conversation
If that's what you wanna do" (do, do)
Then she says "Club is about to end"
Then you say "Why don'tcha come to my crib?"
Then she says "I can't leave my friends"


Now you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been ('and-and) skrewed
(and) 'ewed, 'ewed, chopped, screwed-screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
(and-and) screwed, chopped screwed-screwed
You've officially been s--c--r--e--w--e--d
Screwed, screwed-screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been ('and-and) skrewed

 + (T-Pain ad libs)
Shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me (Yes~!)
Shorty-shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
(Chopped and screwed)
Shorty-shorty don't chop me, shorty-shorty don't screw me (Hey yeahh)
Shorty don't chop me, don't-don't screw me


Have you ever been in the V.I.P. room
Of your favorite strip club? (club, club)
And you got a shawty all on you kissin all on yo' neck
Makin you feel like she's so in love (love, love)
Now you done got you a couple drinks
And you're feelin like it's 'bout that time to cuddle up (up, up)
Then you say "Shawty, what's really up?"
She takes a big sip out your cup
And says "That'll be sixty bucks!"


Now you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been ('and-and) skrewed
(and) 'ewed, 'ewed, chopped, screwed-screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed


Luda-Luda! Hahahaha
Now-now-now shawty why you actin like that, like that
Like all you ever really wanna do is just doubt me
Ludacris, Pain, can't live without 'em
But even mo' I bet you really can't live without me
You-you musta flipped yo' wig
You've gotta be out yo' mind
I'll chop-chop-chop you, screw you
Screw, you outta yo', outta yo' spine
Backbreaker, put you over my knees
Put you on punishment woman and spank you
Have you praisin the Lord like THANK YOU
THANK YOU THANK YOU, Lord I wanna THANK YOU (JESUS~!)
But have you ever met a woman that'll lead you on
And steer you wrong instead of please you? (Yup!)
Have you singin this song, cause all night long
She do nothin but flirt and tease you? (Yup!)
Well I gotta admit that I have
Put one in the air, sit back and I'll laugh
Shawty why you insist on doin me that bad?
Probably cause of the amount of booty that I've grabbed
Comin back to haunt me
So instead of bein put into submission and subdued
(What happened?) Guess what? (Dawg)


Now you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been ('and-and) skrewed
(and) 'ewed, 'ewed, chopped, screwed-screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
(and-and) screwed, chopped screwed-screwed
You've officially been s--c--r--e--w--e--d
Screwed, screwed-screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been ('and-and) skrewed


Shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me (Yes~!)
Shorty-shorty don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
(Chopped and screwed)
Shorty-shorty don't chop me, shorty-shorty don't screw me (Hey yeahh)
Shorty don't chop me, don't-don't screw me

Me, me, me, me, me
