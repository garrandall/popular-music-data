In the night
I hear 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

How could be so Dr. Evil
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'
Homie I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop I won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than
Me

'Cause in the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far far far he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless
Oh

'Cause in the night
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
