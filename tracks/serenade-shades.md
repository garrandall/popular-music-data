Must have been an angel
Sweet spirits raining from above
Shower me with lyrics of love
Blessing me over and over again
So I serenade my song
My love for you
And I'll give you my heart
And I'll serenade for you
For you, serenade for you
For you baby, serenade for you
Oh, said it was my destiny
My calling to find my way to you
Something like out of a dream
Angels came to me and sang this heavenly song to me
So I serenade my song
My love for you
And I'll give you my heart
And I'll serenade for you
For you, serenade for you
For you baby, serenade for you
My love is true for you, never have to worry baby
'Cause I've got what you need, you'll never be alone
My heart will be your shelter and keep you warm
Oh my love, oh my heart, help me
For you, serenade for you
For you baby, serenade for you
So I, so I serenade
So I, so I, so I serenade, so I
