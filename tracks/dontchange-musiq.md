Lately you've been questioning 
If I still see you the same way 
Cause through these trying years
We gonna both physically change 

Now don't you know you you'll always be
The most beautiful woman I know 
So let me reassure you darlin that
My feelings are truly unconditional 


See I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same 
Just as long as your love don't change, No

I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be 
Just as long as your love don't change


Cause I'm not impressed, more or less 
By them girls in the T.V and magazines
Cause honestly I believe that your beauty 
Is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel 
I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve 
I couldn't see myself being with another girl




So don't waste your time worryin bout
Small things that ain't relevant to me
Cause to my understanding your all I want and need
See what I'm tryin to say is I'm here to stay 
And as long as your love doesnât change, then 

Baby darling I swear that I,
I swear I ain't going nowhere no. 



Youâre my baby, yeah
Don't you change baby, no 
Baby you gotta understand that I love you baby, yeah
Donât you know, you gotta know
Youâve got to know
Yeah, yeah
