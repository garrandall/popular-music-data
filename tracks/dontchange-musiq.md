Lately, you've been questionin' if I still see you the same way
'Cause through these tryin' years we gonna both physically change
Now don't you know you'll always be the most beautiful woman I know
So let me reassure you, darlin', that my feelings are truly unconditional


See, I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same
Just as long as your love don't change, no
I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl, the way we are is how it's gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change


'Cause I'm not impressed, more or less by them girls in the TV and magazines
'Cause honestly, I believe that your beauty is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve, I couldn't see myself being with another girl


I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same
Just as long as your love don't change, no
I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl, the way we are is how it's gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change


So don't waste your time worryin' 'bout
Small things that ain't relevant to me
'Cause, to my understandin', you're all I want and need
See what I'm tryin' to say is I'm here to stay
And as long as your love doesn’t change
Then, babe, baby darlin', I swear that I
I swear I ain't going nowhere, no


I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same
Just as long as your love don't change, no
I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl, the way we are is how it's gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change


You’re my baby, yeah
Don't you change, baby, no
Baby, you gotta understand that I love you, baby, yeah
Don’t you know, you gotta know
You’ve got to know
Yeah, yeah
