Oh, babe
Not for you
No, no, no, no

Why can't I keep you from the cold?
You seem to know the different faces
No matter what road you travel on
You go through the darkest places

I can't tell the angels
It'll be good for you, oh, babe
Wanting to say
Blessed be the darkness
For bringing the light through
But I'd be lying to myself

I had no right
Bringing you here
Knowing what I know
Feeling the way I feel, baby

I had no right
Being so uncontented
Being so confused
Being so not for you
Not for you, babe

You're in love with all that you don't know
Animates your expectations
What's the easiest way to hurt a man?
Give him all he's ever wanted

I'm trying to tell the angels
I don't know what to do, oh, baby
Convincing myself to believe
All the sadness, have purpose too
Makes me hate this, oh, no

I had no right
Bringing you here
Knowing what I know
Feeling the way I feel, baby

I had no right
Being so uncontented
Being so confused
Being so not for you

Not for you
So, so, so, so
Not for you, babe

When you asked the angels
To make you a better you, oh, baby
Dream all you want
'Cause all the light you occupy
They will try and take it all from you

I had no right, baby
Bringing you here
Knowing what I know
Feeling the way I feel, baby

I had no right
Being so uncontented
Being so confused, baby
Being so not for you

Oh, baby
Oh, not for you
No, no, no, no, no
Not for you
Oh, save me, babe, save me, babe
Not for you, no
Being so not for you
