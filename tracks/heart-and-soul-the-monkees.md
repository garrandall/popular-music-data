Love in a vacuum, love in space.
Love without even a little hint of a trace.
Love in confusion and love doesn't show on your face.

Love is a stranger, love is a box.
Love is the key that fits a million locks.
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you go.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.
I wish you'd put your heart and soul
Where I can think they're mine.
I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can see them shine.

Love in a distance, love in a walk.
Love in the limit if only people could talk.
Love for the moment till it swings like a hawk.

Love for tomorrow, love for today.
Love for the hour it could be coming your way.
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.
I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can think they're mine.
I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can see them shine.
I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can think they're mine

I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can see them shine.
I wish you put your heart and soul
Where I can think they're mine...
