You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
You broke my heart, now we're apart
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame

Ah, yes you are
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame

Ah!
You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
