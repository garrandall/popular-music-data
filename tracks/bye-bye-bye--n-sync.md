Bye, Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye, Bye

I'm doin this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby, come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more 
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Just hit me with the truth
Now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on
I live for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm giving up I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason 
For your love no more
Bye, Bye

I'm checkin out
I'm signin off
Don't wanna be the loser 
And I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind
Bye, bye, bye...

I don't wanna make it tough
Make it tough
But I had enough
And it ain't no lie 
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, Bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two 
I don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Don't really wanna make it tough 
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie

Bye, bye, bye
