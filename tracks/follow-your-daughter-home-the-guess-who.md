Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home

Keep her out of trouble
Follow your daughter home
Staying out late in the bar with the bad men
Follow your daughter home
Keep her out of mischief
Follow your daughter home
What are the boys like she's staying and sleeping with
Follow your daughter home
Watch her

Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home

Keep her out of mischief
Follow your daughter home
What are the boys like she's running and dancing with
Follow your daughter home
Is she still a virgin
Follow your daughter home
Staying out late with the boys past midnight
Follow your daughter home
Tie her up

Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home

Keep her out of trouble
Follow your daughter home
Staying out late in the bar with the bad men
Follow your daughter home
Keep her out of mischief
Follow your daughter home
You're asking lots of questions 'bout the boys she's sleeping with
Follow your daughter home
Watch her, watch her

Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home
Lovely young woman, now
Hey man, follow your daughter home
Hey man, follow your daughter home
Watch her
Hey, follow your daughter home
