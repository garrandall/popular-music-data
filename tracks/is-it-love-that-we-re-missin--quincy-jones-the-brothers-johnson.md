Featuring Brothers Johnson
Hey, oh, oh...
Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you
There were times when we tried
To get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you
It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining
Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you
It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you take my love
And just walk away
And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing
Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
(Tell me) is it love that we're missing
I tried so hard to make it work
But it seems to me, only got hurt
Is it love that we're missing
(Tell me, baby, I wanna know)
Peace of mind we're not getting...
