Heartless
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh, yeah)
You hear it clear in my

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless


She got me confused, I swear she got me mixed up (Woah)
I don't need you, girl, so I don't care if I slip up
Yes, I swear I'm heartless, more life, hold my wrist up
She rob me for my love, I feel like this a stick-up (Freeze)
Yeah, it's Lil Uzi from the 16
Grade-A bank account, you know I'm with the A-team
Went up in my level, don't know why they hate me
I knew I was gonna be this way since eighteen
I heard she got that water, I'm tryna be waist-deep
I make her beg for it, make that girl wan' say please
Yes, I'm heartless, I get chilly in this Chrome fleece
I put emeralds in my Rollie, they don't even make these (Woah)
