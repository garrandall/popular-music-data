You gotta have love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

I look out my window
And what do I see
I see a world that's full of confusion
And I know just what it needs

It needs to have a little love in its heart
It's gotta have a song you can sing
It's gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

I look in my mirror
And what do I see, yeah
I see a man
Who's lost and is wandering
And I know just what he needs

He needs to have a little love in his heart
He's gotta have a song on his lips
He's gotta let freedom roll
Then he'll feel good
Yes he will

Don't you wanna feel good
Yes I do
Oh, you should feel good
Yes I do
You've gotta feel good, oh yeah
Yes I do

You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will
You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Yeah people
And I'm talking to you
And you-oh-oh-oh yeah
Say it, say it again
Oh, oh, oh... Oh yeah
You sound so good
