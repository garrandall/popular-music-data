I don't know when it started
Just how long it's been
Where it began

I never meant to love her
Just turned out that way, yeah
Oh, and this is how I
Want it to stay, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever
I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever

Now, I'll be yours forever
Until the day I die
But I don't know why

If you'll just stand by me, girl
I'll be twice as strong, yeah
Oh, 'cause I could never
Make it alone, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever
Yeah, I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever

Oh, I can't make
A move without you
Yeah, there ain't no way
To groove without you

And I don't know what
I'd do without you
To show me the way

I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever
Don't you know
I just wanna keep it together
Forever and ever and ever

Don't you know
I just wanna keep it
Keep it together
Forever and ever and ever

I just wanna keep it
Keep it together
Forever and ever and ever

I just wanna keep it
Keep it together
Forever and ever and ever
