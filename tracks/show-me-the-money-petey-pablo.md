Show off that body you got
You got that dance floor so hot
You're working that, you twerkin that
You're checking that, like a clock


Can't nobody do it like I do it,
when I do it, dog I do it
(break it down) Break it down put you back into it
Main you all ain't ready for the **** I'm doing
(get up) Get up put your drinks down
Don't want you all saucy your drinks out
All over that your cheap blouse ain't nothing but a small any anyhow
(still me) Still me I just changed the sound to the other one I had and just swapped it out
(switch) Kept something in the background, 'cause you in love with the song but you're in love with the background
Come on let a momma work for me
Make a player wanna spend some money
(come on) I don't really like to spend a money
But you can do what you do and do it well I'm gonna




(show up) Show up, empty
Nothing in um, her...her
No Silicone, no lipo, no botox, no dumpy dump (no)
All natural, let the day spoil when another brother in this world
Good looking momma
That good and hot to death make an athlete lose his breath
And had to move that *** when you bump south
You're gonna need a couple squirt keep falling out
(for real) a 10.5 on a Rhictor scale a high number you can go to 12
shorty shaking like hell
We ought to be shamed ourselves, creator couldn't rock the bed that well
(look out) Breaking it down, riding this beat like (WOW)
Papa jail man I gun her down

This is defiantly the wickedest thing I hear of my life!
OK! I've been sipping on that patron
(get up, get up)
I'm ready, give you what you want
OK! (get up, get up)
Might not feel the same way tomorrow (OK)
But I'll deal with that tomorrow
(get up, get up)
'cause tonight you got me feeling like I wanna take you home
