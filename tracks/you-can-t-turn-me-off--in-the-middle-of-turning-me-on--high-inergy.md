I melt, I feel so weak
It's gettin hard to go to sleep
With this feeling, this feeling on my mind
It needs you baby to satisfy

You can't turn me off
Not in the middle of turning me on
I can't suddenly stop

You changed me from cold to hot
Now I'm ready to give you all the love I've got
Please don't leave me now
Can't you read in my eyes
This need I have to love
So don't tease me now (don't tease me)
Please, please me now

You can't turn me off (no you can't turn me off)
Not in the middle of turning me on (in the middle in the middle)
I can't suddenly stop

Each and every time we touch
Oh this feeling too much
Take me to that special place
You've gone too far to leave me so spaced baby
You won't tease me now (don't tease me)
You want do nothing but please me now

You can't turn me off (no you can't turn me off)
Not in the middle of turning me on
I can't suddenly stop

Well if you love me (if you love me)
Like I love you (like I love you)
Then you'll do what I want you to do baby please
You'll come and hold me in your lovin arms
And make my heart rush straight to the stars

So don't tease me now
You won't do nothin but please me now

You can't turn me off (no you can't turn me off)
Not in the middle of turning me on
