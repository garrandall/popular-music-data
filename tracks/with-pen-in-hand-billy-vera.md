With pen in hand
You sign your name
Today at five
I'll be on that train

And you'll be free
And I will be alone
So all alone

If you think we can't
Find the love we once knew
If you think I can't
Make everything up to you

Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own

And I wonder, can you
Take good care of little Billy
Can you take him to school everyday

Can you teach him
How to catch a fish
And keep all those bullies away
Hear what I say

Can you teach him
How to whistle a tune
Can you tell him
About the man in the moon

If you can do these things
Then maybe he won't miss me
Maybe he won't miss me

And tonight as you lay
In that big, lonely bed
Can you look at the pillow
Where I laid my head

And with your heart on fire
Will you have no desire
To kiss me and to hold me

And if you can forget
The good times we had
If you think that the good times
Don't outweigh the bad

Then sign your name
And I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
