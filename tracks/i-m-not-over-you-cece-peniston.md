I tried to let it go
I'm not, not over you
Over you, over you
I ain't over you

I can't believe it's over
It's hard to let you go
'Cause I can't sleep at night
And there's one thing that I know
I'm not, not over you, oooh
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
I don't know why it's over
I don't know where to turn
I tried to let it go
But there's one thing that I know
I'm not, not over you, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Tell me what can I do when I know we are through
(We are through, oooh.)
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time.  (All the time.)
I can't get over you no matter what I do
I'm not, not over you, oooh

I know inside I gave it
I gave it all I had
I did all I could do and still it hurts me so bad
I'm not, not over you, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Tell me what can I do when I know we are through
(We are through, oooh.)
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time.  (All the time.)
I can't get over you no matter what I do

Oh
Oh
I'm not, not over you, oooh .  (Baby.)
Over you, over you
I'm not, not over you, oooh, baby
I ain't over you.  (I'm not, not)
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
Ahhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
('Cause we are through.) 'Cause we are really through

Hey.....eh, eh
Ah, oh, ah, oh.  I ain't over you, baby
(I can't get over you no matter what I do.)
Hey.....eh, eh, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh, eh
I ain't over you

Tell me what can I do (Oh) when I know we are through
(Baby)
Can't get you off my mind
I'm not, not over you, oooh
I'm not, not over you, oooh
I'm not, not over you, oooh

I can't get you off of my mind
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
Oh, baby, I ain't over you
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
'Cause the only thing I know, I know I'm not over you, baby
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
What am I supposed to do
Baby, I ain't over you
What am I supposed to do
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(I'm not, not over you, oooh.)
What am I supposed to do
Baby, I ain't over you
What am I supposed to do
