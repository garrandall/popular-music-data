(I wonder, I wonder)

I wonder who's kissing her now
You know I wonder who's
Teaching her how

I wonder who's
Looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs
Telling my baby those lies

I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now

I wonder, I wonder
Who's buying the wine
For lips that I once called mine
You know I wonder if
She ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now
