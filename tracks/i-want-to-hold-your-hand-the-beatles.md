Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

Oh please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand

I'll let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
