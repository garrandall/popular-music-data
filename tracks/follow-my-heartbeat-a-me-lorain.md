If I live and I die
Does it matter at all
To anyone else in this whole world
If I manage to scale up the highest of walls
To stand or to fall
Would it matter

Something in my soul sends me on
It doesn’t even know how hard the way
Something even the darkest parts can’t scare away

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

If I cherish the truth
Abhore the lies
Would the world even care
How I chose it
If I showed my face
Or I wore a disguise
Would the world have the eyes to know it

Something through the cold keeps me warm
Even as the passing storms throw rain
Something’s always there
No matter what it takes

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

Just a little dream is all I need
Even if it doesn’t change a thing
Every step I take
Will mean the world to me
And all that I know is

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to
