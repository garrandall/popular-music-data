He's free as the breeze,
He's always at ease.
He lives in the jungle
And hangs by his knees,
As he swings through trees
Without a trapeeze,
In his BVD's.
A-hoo hoo!

He's got a union card
And he's practicin' hard
To play the gitar.
Gon' be a big star,
Yeah he's gonna go far.
An' carry moonbeams home in a jar!

He ordered Chet's guitar course COD,
Makes A&E an' he's workin' on B.
Digs C&W&R&B an' an' me an' a chimpanzee
Agree that one day soon he'll be,
A celebrity.
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
OWWWWWWWWW!

Gitarzan!
He's a gitar man!
He's all you can stand,
Give him a hand,
Gitarzan!

(Tarzan yell)


He's gotta girl named Jane,
With no last name.
Kinda homely and plain,
But he loves her just the same.
'Cause she kindles a flame,
And it drives him insane,
When he hears her sing.
She really does her thing.
It's here claim to fame,
Come on, sing one Jane:

Baby, baby, Whaooooo Baby!

Whaooooo Baby!

How 'bout that,
Lets here it for Jane!

Thank ya' folks.

Well, they gotta pet monkey,
He likes to get drunky,
And sing boogie woogie,
And it sounds real funky,
Come on, yo' time, boy,
Sing one monkey,
Here we go,



Lets here it for the monkey!
Whooooo!
(He He He He)

On Saturday night they need some excitement,
Jane gets right and the monkey gets tight,
And their voices unite, in the pale moon light,
And it sounds alright, yeah, it's dynamite,
It's outta sight.
Let's hear it, right nnnnnnnnow!

Shut up baby, I'm tryin' to sing!

Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Owwwwwww!

Gitarzan!
And his jungle band!
They're all you can stand,
Give 'em a hand, Gitarzan!
