I stumbled up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding light
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? what went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray
It isn't even the weekend
Baby that's, how I know, you're the one for me

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (with you)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
Put your arms around me baby,
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running,
Shut down every block
Put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do, we do-o-o
How we do-o-o, yeah.

Hungover I think I'm broken
You said the fix is a shot of  Jake
I said girl why are you smoking
But alright, pour a glass and we'll throw 'em back

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (with you-u-u)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
Put your arms around me baby,
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running,
Shut down every block
Put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
Cause that's just how we do,
Cause this is how we do

Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby,
We're tearing up the town
That's just how we do.
