You've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like


Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body


Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you


Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes




Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

Gonna dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over your body
All over your body
