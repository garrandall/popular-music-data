I ain't complainin'
But I'm tired, so I'm just sayin'
What I think
And if we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink

My baby's growin' up
She think's she's fallin' all in love
And that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her


Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we gonna do ?
Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we gonna do about it ?


Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong, their always right
We use to be the one's breakin' the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

She rolls her eye's when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
Oh my god, she's got a car
Swears they won't go far
And I wish I believed 'em





Their beautiful, wild and free
Everything we wish we could be
But their still crazy
Oh you know, the make us crazy



Yeah Teenage Daughters

I ain't complainin'
But I'm just tired, so I'm sayin'
What I think
If we're being honest
Than honestly, I think I need a drink
