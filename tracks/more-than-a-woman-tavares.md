Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman
More than a woman to me, baby
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ah

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Yes you are, baby)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ah

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me, yeah
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Every day of my life)
More than a woman (Ohh baby)
More than a woman to me, yeah (You are, you are, you are)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (She treats me good, like a love should)
More than a woman (Yeah)
More than a woman to me (Yeah baby)
