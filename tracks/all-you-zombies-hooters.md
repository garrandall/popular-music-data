(All you zombies)
(All you people in the street)

Holy Moses met the Pharaoh
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye, "Let my people go."

Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
(He's just gonna break them in half)

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

No one ever spoke to Noah
They all laughed at him instead
Working on his ark, working all by himself

Only Noah saw it coming
Forty days and forty nights
Took his sons and daughters with him
Yeah, they were the Israelites

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street

All you zombies hide your faces (I know you)
All you people in the street (let's see you)
All you sittin' in high places
The rain's gonna fall on you

Holy Father, what's the matter
Where have all your children gone
Sitting in the dark, living all by themselves
You don't have to hide anymore
All you zombies show your faces...
