Once in a lifetime 
You'll open up your heart 
Maybe once in your lifetime 
You'll swear to never be apart 
You think your love's on solid ground 
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down 

Who's gonna hold me tonight 
When I'm feeling lonely 
Who's gonna show me the light 
'Cause I need to know 
With all the things we've go 
How can love just stop 
Tell Me 
Somebody help me understand 

And my picture in your locket 
What will you do with it now 
All our friends and all our memories 
Tell me how we sort them out 
What's yours is yours 
What's mine is mine 
Is that all that's left 
After all this time 

Who's gonna hold me tonight 
When I'm feeling lonely 
Who's gonna show me the light 
'Cause I need to know 
With all the things we've go 
How can love just stop 
Tell Me 
Somebody help me understand 

Help me understand 
Why I'm not part of our plan 
And you don't need me anymore 
Help me understand 
Why I still wanna be where you are 
Even though I know in my hear 
You don't love me anymore 

Who's gonna hold me tonight 
When I'm feeling lonely 
Who's gonna show me the light 
'Cause I need to know 
With all the things we've go 
How can love just stop 
Tell Me 
Somebody help me understand
