I would sail around the world
Look for gold and dive for pearl
But I know I will never get to go
I would like to win a prize, be in everybody's eyes
But it's true, I would probably not get to

My life has always been simple
No one ever knows when I come and go
And my dreams are ending at sunrise
And dreaming just don't make it so

So I've lived with no regret
Wouldn't change a thing and yet
Now and then, wish that I could start again

My life has always been simple
No one ever knows when I come and go
And my dreams are ending at sunrise
And dreaming just don't make it so

I would sail around the world
Look for gold and dive for pearl
But I know I will never get to go
Guess it's true, I would probably not get to
Oh no, I will never get to go
