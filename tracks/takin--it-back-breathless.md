I wanna be the first one on your list
First thing in the morning
When your bloodshot eyes
Are seeing the other side
Every unheeded warning

Well, you won't remember this
Something's gonna miss

And it was something you implied
Baby, when you said it
Well, I told myself
It was someone else
Yet I can't quite forget it

In your present state of mind
Excuses are hard to find

And you'll be takin' it back
You're gonna be takin' it back
Tomorrow when you're flat on your back
You're gonna be takin' it back

Well, I always took your side
Tonight I took a ride

'Cause you were really hot tonight
Really quite impressive
But it's just too intense
When it's at my expense
You tend to get excessive

Anything for a laugh
Except your better half

And you'll be takin' it back
You're gonna be takin' it back
Tomorrow when you're flat on your back
You're gonna be takin' it back

Oh, whoa, whoa
Takin' it back
Yeah, yeah
Takin' it back

Come on, girl
Takin' it back
Oh, oh, oh
Takin' it back

Take it, take it, take it
