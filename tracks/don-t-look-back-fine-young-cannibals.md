Never had the good things only money could buy
I'd drive my car but I haven't got a car to drive
Never had a holiday in a tropical sun
Good times look rough They're never going to come
Oh I know these times are bad
And they make you want to cry
Don't be sad
We'll get by
Baby baby don't look back
It won't do no good
Baby baby don't look back
I'm going to leave and I think that you should

When I spent my life
In a place like this
On the first bus out
I'm going to get myself a lift
If you understand
Well that's alright
If you want to go
It's got to be tonight

Oh I know these times are bad
And it makes you want to cry
Don't feel sad
We'll get by
Baby baby don't look back
It won't do no good
Baby baby don't look back
I'm going to leave and I think that you should

Never had the good things only money could buy
I'd drive my car but I haven't got a car to drive

Oh I know these times are bad
And they make you want you to cry
Don't be sad
We'll get by
Baby baby don't look back
It won't do no good
Baby baby don't look back
I'm going to leave and I think that you should

Baby baby don't look back
It won't do no good
Baby baby don't look back
I'm going to leave and I think that you should
Baby baby don't look back
Baby baby don't look back
Baby baby don't look back
