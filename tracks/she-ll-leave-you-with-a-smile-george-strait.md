At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile


Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face


One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile


Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face


At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile


Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile
Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile
