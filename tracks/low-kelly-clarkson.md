Everybodyâs talking
But they donât say a thing
They look at me with sad eyes
But I donât want the sympathy
Its cool you didnât want me
Sometimes you canât go back
But whyâd you have to go and make a mess like that
Well I just have to say
Before I let go

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
What you did was low

No I donât need your number
Thereâs nothing left to say
Except I never thought it'd hurt this much to be saved
My friends are outside waiting
Iâve gotta go

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
What you did was low
What you did was low (low)
What you did was low (low)
What you did was low (low)

I walk out of this darkness
With no sense of regret
And I go with a clear conscience
We both know that you canât say that
Here's to show
For all the time I loved you soâ¦
So...

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
What you did was low
Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
What you did was low 
Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
Cuz what you did was low
