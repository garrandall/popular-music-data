(Momma didn't know, Momma didn't know
Nobody will ever know)

Because I'm never gonna tell, I'm never gonna tell
I'm never gonna tell on you (doo-wah)
If you don't tell on me little girl
I'm never gonna tell on you oh-oh
Never gonna tell on you

I'm never gonna tell, I'm never gonna tell
I'm never gonna tell on you
If you don't tell on me little girl
I'm never gonna tell on you oh-oh
Never gonna tell on you
(Never gonna tell on you)

Somebody sneaked out late last night
The stars were shining and the moon was bright
Somebody kissed me tenderly
But I ain't saying who the guy might be
(Momma didn't know, Momma didn't know
And nobody will ever know)
Because I'm never gonna tell, I'm never gonna tell

I'm never gonna tell on you (doo-wah)
There's so much bliss in stolen kisses
Till you're old enough to say I do
(Never gonna tell on you)
(Never gonna tell on you)

Somebody better treat me nice
Listen to a bit of good advice
Meet me tonight my buttercup
You might be sorry if you don't show up
(Momma didn't know, Momma didn't know
And nobody will ever know)

Because I'm never gonna tell, I'm never gonna tell
I'm never gonna tell on you (doo-wah)
If you don't tell on me little girl
I'm never gonna tell on you oh-oh
Never gonna tell on you
I'm never gonna tell, I'm never gonna tell
I'm never gonna tell on you
There's so much bliss in stolen kisses
Till you're old enough to say I do
Never gonna tell on yoo
(Never gonna tell on you)
(Never gonna tell on you)
(Never gonna tell on you)
(Never gonna tell on you)
(Never gonna tell on you)
