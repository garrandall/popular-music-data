Why should I cry
Why should I cry, baby, for you
Why should I cry
Why should I cry, baby, for you


So many tears
Pour out of me
There must be a river
Of feelings inside
Confirming my fears
I was the giver


Spending my days
Waiting for you in vain
All I got was pain
A broken heart isn't easy to hide
You don't feel the same


Why should I cry?
Why should I cry, baby, for you?
Why should I cry?
Why should I cry, baby, for you?


I had enough
This can't go on
Your love is crazy
You seem to think
I couldn't live
I'm thinking maybe


This dance that we're dancing, now
Who's in control?
I have had to bend
But you're like a shadow
That hides in the night
When will it end?




Tell me, am I crazy? Is it me?
Or are you far too blind to see?
Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why can't love be like I want it to be?
Oh no




Are you lonely?
Are you wanting someone
To love you like I used to do?
Are you burning?
Are you yearning for someone
To hold you like I used to do?
