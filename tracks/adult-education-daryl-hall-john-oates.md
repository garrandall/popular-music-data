Afternoon in the homeroom
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam
On the plan you had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know
Could put you right
In the lot the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school

And that's why
The student body got a bad reputation
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
What they need is adult education
Back to school it's a bad situation
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
What you want is an adult education

Oh, yeah
The teacher don't know about how to deal
With the student body (huh, huh)
And the underclassmen are flashing
Hot and cool (huh, huh)
But your girlfriends care
About watch and wear
And talkin about it (huh, huh)
Believe it or not
There's life after high school (huh, huh)
That's right

The student body got a bad reputation
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school
It's a bad situation
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
What you want is an adult education
Oh, yeah

They're calling it preparation (huh, huh)
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number (huh, huh)
Memories that you won't remember
So you got a little education (huh, huh)
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school (huh, huh)
Maybe some of it'll rub off on ya
The boys are busy in the mirrors (huh, huh)
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender (huh, huh)
More memories you won't remember
The senior with the Junior Miss (huh, huh)
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult (huh, huh)
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education
Adult education
Adult education
It's a bad situation
Adult education
