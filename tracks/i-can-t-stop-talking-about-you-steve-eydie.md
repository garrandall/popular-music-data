My friends think I'm an awful bore
Ever since I fell in love with you
I'm not well rounded anymore
There's just one thing I like to do

I just can't stop talking about you
Can't stop saying I love you
Can't stop telling the
World you're mine

I give lectures on your lips
Go on for hours on the way we met
I talk pages on your smile
And still I haven't scratched
The surface yet

Somehow, I can't
Stop talking about you
Can't stop saying I love you
Can't stop telling the
World you're mine

I can't stop all this crowing
There's nothing I can do
My heart just keeps overflowing
With new things to say about you

I guess there's no relief in sight
Everybody better be resigned

Cause I just can't
Stop talking about you
Can't stop saying I love you
Can't stop telling the
World you're mine

La la la la

Cause I just can't
Stop talking about you
Can't stop saying I love you
Can't stop telling the
World you're mine

Yes, I just can't
Stop talking about you
Can't stop saying I love you...
