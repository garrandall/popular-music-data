Blow a kiss from your hand
I catch it 'fore it hits the ground
Cry a little for our fears baby baby
I'm so scared, there's something wrong
I hid you in the corner of my empty room
Never really cared till now
Not standing in the corner from me
Anymore, you've done your time
I sure sent 'em my best line
When my time is through, oh
Can I still come home to you?

Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call
'Cause you know I'll be there
Ew...
Anytime anytime, you need me
Anytime anytime, maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming... oh

I know I caused you so much pain
I promise that I'll never hurt you again
Even though the scars remain
With a little time I know, we can win
Can't stop this ride
Lost control of my desire
Still it burns for you
Like it always used to do

Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call
'Cause you know I'll be there
Ew...
Anytime anytime, you need me
Anytime anytime, maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming, oh

And after the war is over
And all the fighting's through
Can't I make my peace with you
I wanna come home to you

Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call
'Cause I'm always there
Yeah yeah
Anytime anytime, you need me
Anytime anytime, maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming... oh

(Anytime anytime) anytime you want me
(Anytime anytime) ew, so lonely, so lonely
But you know I care, yeah
Anytime anytime... do you need me
Anytime anytime, oh are you dreamin'
Waking up all alone your heart is screamin'
