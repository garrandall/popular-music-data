We had a quarrel the other day
And I just let you walk away
'Cause I was proud
So proud and strong
Yes I was much too proud to say I was wrong

You turned back crying and called to me
But I just stood there silently
'Cause I was proud
So proud and strong
Yes I was much too proud to say I was wrong

Some other guy might have crawled to you
And said don't go, I need you so
But I wouldn't do it
No, I couldn't do it
And so I let you say good-bye
And I was proud to let you cry
Proud I held my head up high
And now I'm just a proud and lonely guy
