(CHORUS)
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you

You were always around
While I went through my changes
At times, I thought you
To be a fool

What could your purpose be
What did you see in me
When did I discover how great
Your love for me must be

(CHORUS)

Deep in my heart, I know
I know, the Lord had blessed me
For he has caused my
Foolish heart to see, oh, yeah

The heartbreak I've caused you
The wrong I can't undo
I'm so ashamed for all
The things I did to you

(CHORUS)

Ohhh...

(CHORUS)

The wrong I've done to you
Will take a lifetime to undo
But I stand ready
To prove my love to you

No, no, no...
Ah, ah...

I can't do enough now, baby
No, no, no...
