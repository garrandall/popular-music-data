The world is your oyster, so get yourself to sea
Time is of the essence, so try to keep some free
I'm a child and I'm a father, and I love my family
There's no place underneath the stars that I would rather be

We are the difference between the present and the past
We are the distance between the first and last
My life will be unlimited and full shall be my past
I am ready, I am willing, and I'm able for the task

I was born to believe
I was born to believe

We are one
We are strong
We can sing a different song
Let the right shine through the wrong
We're all here where weee belong

No

I'm not here to talk about freedom
I'm not here to talk about love
I'm just lucky I'm still breathin' beneath the sky above
You can leave your life of leisure waiting for the perfect rhyme
But while you keep on pushin' me the things you're missin'
The fight keeps kickin' and it's right on time and

I was born to believe
I was born to believe

We are one
We are strong
We can sing a different song
Let the right shine through the wrong
We're all here where we belong

I was born to believe
I was born to believe

We are one
We are strong
We can sing a different song
Let the right shine through the wrong
We're all here where we belong
