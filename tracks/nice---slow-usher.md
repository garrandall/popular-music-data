Now you got it hot for me already, baby
Okay

(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

It's seven o' clock
On the dot

Cruisin' the streets, oh yeah
I gotta real pretty, pretty little thing
That's waiting for me

I pull up
Anticipating good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen girl, you know what I mean

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just want to take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

See I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be makin' love until the sun cones up
Baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

Now here we are
Drivin' 'round town
Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down

Girl, you got me sayin'
My, my, my (My)
I wish that I (I)
Could pull over
And get this thing stated right now

I wanna do something freaky to you baby
I won't think they hurt me
I wanna do something freaky to you baby

They call my name
They call me
U-S-H-E-R R-A-Y-M-O-N-D
Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me

Gotta nigga from feenin' like Jocdeci
Every time that you roll with me, holdin' me
Tryin to get control of me nice and slowly
You know never lettin' go
Never messin' up the flow
This is how the hook go

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just want to take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

See I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be makin' love until the sun cones up
Baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

Now tell me
Do you wanna get freaky
'Cause I'll freak you right, I will
