If tomorrow all the things were gone you'd worked for all your life
And you had to start again with just your family and your my wife
Would you thank your lucky stars to be livin' here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, and gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, from New York to LA
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say

That I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, and gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
God bless the USA
