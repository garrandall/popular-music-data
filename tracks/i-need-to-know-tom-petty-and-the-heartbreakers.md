I was talking with a friend of mine, said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so and turned around and let him go
Then he said, "You better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size"

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby?
Don't do me like that

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you, baby
Don't do me like that

Listen honey, can you see? Baby, it would bury me
If you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I need you baby?
Don't do me like that

'Cause somewhere deep down inside
Someone is saying, "Love doesn't last that long"
I've had this feelin' inside night and day in
And baby I can't take it no more

Listen honey, can you see? Baby, it would bury me
If you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
I just might need you honey
Don't do me like that

Wait!
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby,
Don't, don't, don't

No!
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby...

Oh, oh, oh
