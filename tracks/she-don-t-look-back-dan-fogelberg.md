She's got a way of
Getting so inside you
That you think she's
Gonna steal your soul
She's got a way of making sure
That you can't let go

She's got a trail of
Broken hearts behind her
Like a shadow
Where no shadow's cast
I ain't the first one and
I doubt that I'll be the last

Too long, too late
You're wrong
To ever think she'd wait

She don't look back, oh, oh
She don't look back, oh, oh
She don't look back, oh, oh
The lady don't look back
And when she's gone, she's gone

You can never tell
Just what she's after
You can never read it
In her eyes
And in her laughter
There's no hint of compromise

You can stare
Into the fire forever
You can squeeze a stone
Until it bleeds
But you will never find
The kind of love she needs

Too much, too late
You're such
A fool to think she'd wait

She don't look back, oh, oh
She don't look back, oh, oh
She don't look back, oh, oh
She don't look back, oh, oh
And when she's gone, she's gone

She don't look back
She don't look back
She don't look back
She don't look back
She don't look back
