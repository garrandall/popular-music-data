You say that you love (Say you love me)
All of the time (All of the time)
You say that you need me (Say you need me)
You'll always be mine (Always be mine)

I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine

I'll make you happy (Make you happy)
You'll never be blue (Never be blue)
You'll have no sorrow (Have no sorrow)
'Cause I'll always be true (Always be true)

And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine

Other girls may try to take me away (Take me away)
But you know, it's by your side I will stay
I-I'll stay

Our love will last, now (Our love will last)
'Til the end of time (End of time)
Because this love, now (Because this love)
Is only yours and mine (Yours and mine)

And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Oh, baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine

Other girls may try to take me away (Take me away)
But you know, it's by your side I will stay
I-I'll stay

Our love will last, now (Our love will last)
'Til the end of time (End of time)
Because this love, now (Because this love)
Is only yours and mine (Yours and mine)

And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm a-glad all over
So glad you're mine

So glad you're mine, now
(Mi-i-i-i-i-i-ine) 
I said I'm so glad you're mine
(Mi-i-i-i-i-i-ine)
So glad you're mine, now
(Mi-i-i-i-i-i-ine)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
(Mi-i-i-i-ine)
