I went down to the centre of town
And my feet was a burning ground
She stood on the corner merrily as can be
I said hey good lookin won't you come with me
She said yeah
I am the stealer
Came to steal your love

The sun was shining
The world was right
I said "tell me baby wha'cha doin' tonight"
I'm goin' round the corner
Where the music's loud
I'm tired of the city
Won't you come on round
I said yeah!
I'm the stealer
Come to steal your love

Steal your love oh yeah!

Goin' round the corner
Where the music's loud
I'm tired of the city
Won't you come on round
I said yeah
I am the stealer
Come to steal your love

Steal your love
Steal your love
Steal your love

I am going to steal you love away
I am going to steal you love away
Steal your love
