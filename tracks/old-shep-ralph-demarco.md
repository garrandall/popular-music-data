When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows
We'd stray

Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

As the years rolled on
Old Shep had grown old
His eyes were fast growing dim

And one day, the doctor
Looked at me and said
I can do no more for him, Jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at
Shep's faithful head

I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would
Shoot me instead

Now old Shep has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep
Will I roam

But if dogs have a Heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home
