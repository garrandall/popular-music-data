You made me happy, you made me sing
But now without you, I've lost everything
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)

No one to talk to when I'm alone
No one to call me, call me her own
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)

(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Maybe tomorrow
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Maybe in time
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: I'll find an angel
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Who wants to be mine
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Someone who needs me
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Like I'm needing you
(dum-dum-dum-dum)
SPOKEN: Someone to love me and to always be true

But, oh my darling (oh-oh oh yes)
I love you still (he loves you still)
I dream about you (oh-oh oh yes)
And I always will (he always will)
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout you (wi-ithout you)
