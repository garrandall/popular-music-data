One very happy warm summer night
I saw your face, what could I do
So carefully I walked straight up to you

And in the shadow of a moonlit night
I saw those eyes a-shinin' through
Heart of gold I love you, misty blue

Whoa, it's hard to love somebody
Especially when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're loving someone else
Strung out and hung up on you

I feel like Bogart in a crazy movie
Bogie and me, we never beg
But this time maybe I've got voices in my head

They're sayin' that he's never been good to you
And he's always hurt and let you down
If what you need is good lovin', I'll be around

It's hard to love somebody
Especially when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're loving someone else
Strung out and hung up on you
Strung out
Strung out

Well, it's hard to love somebody
Especially when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're loving someone else
Strung out and hung up on you

It's hard to love somebody
Oh, when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're loving someone else,
Strung out and hung up on you
Strung out and hung up on you
Yeah, strung out
