When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those ol' clouds that rain so blue

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At bein' on our own

'Cause when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

The way I love you
The way I love you
