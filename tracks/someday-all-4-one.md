Someday
When we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live
And let live

Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
And greed will not pay
Godspeed
This bright millennium
On its way
Let it come someday

Someday
Our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
Till then
On days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
And we'll wish upon the moon

There are some days dark and bitter
Seems we haven't got a prayer
But a prayer for something better
Is the one thing we all share

Someday
When we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live
And let live

Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
And greed will not pay
Godspeed
This bright millennium
Let it come
Wish upon the moon
One day, someday
Soon

One day, someday
Soon
