You think you love Sue but when I get thru with you
You won't ever look at Sue again
I'm gonna be so good to you, I'm gonna love you my whole life thru
Pretty soon you'll feel the same, you won't even know her name
I'll give ya kisses that she can't
Beat, I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too, not Sue
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too
I'm gonna treat you sweet and kind,
I'll drive her right outta your mind
And you won't know her if you meet walk right by her on the street
Because I want you and need you so poor Susie will have to go
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too, not Sue
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too
I'm gonna be so good to you, I'll love you my whole life through
Pretty soon you'll feel the same, you won't even know her name
I'll give you kisses that she can't
Beat, I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too, not Sue
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too, not Sue
When I get thru with you, you'll love me too, not Sue
