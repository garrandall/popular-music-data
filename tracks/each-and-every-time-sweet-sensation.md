Whoa whoa ooh
Ooh ooh
Whoa whoa
Oh baby

Some lovers dazzle me with their limousines and pearls
They wine and dine you and they promise you the world
But then the party's over everything is changed
The fire's gone and nothing else remains

With you
It's more than just a passion
With you
I know that love will last

When you look in my eyes (whoa whoa)
You lift me up so high
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when the world is cold (whoa whoa)
You're always there to hold
Each and every time
Each and every time

I've had to pay the price of knowing how to love
And getting hooked on those who never could get enough
You are the reason I can take another chance
'Cause you know the meaning of a true romance

With you
It's more than just a passion
With you
I know that love will last

When you look in my eyes (whoa whoa)
You lift me up so high
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when the world is cold (whoa whoa)
You're always there to hold
Each and every time
Each and every time
Whenever you're around (whoa whoa)
My heart's up in the clouds
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when you take my hand (whoa whoa)
I know you understand
Each and every time
Each and every time

Every time you call my name
It thrills me just the same
And I know I'll always feel this way

T-t-t-turn it out
Whoa whoa

With you
It's more than attraction
With you
I know this love will last

Whoa whoa

You're the one who makes me feel this way
Always in your arms I'll stay
Right here with you baby
I'm yours and yours and yours alone
You will always be the one
And I don't mean maybe

Haven't got a taste for material things (whoa whoa)
Boy I don't need no diamond ring
You know I know just what true love can bring
You're my everything (whoa whoa)
My everything (each and every time)
What true love can bring

When you look in my eyes (whoa whoa)
You lift me up so high (oh baby)
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when the world is cold (whoa whoa)
You're always there to hold (you're always there to hold)
Each and every time (huh)
Each and every time (every little time)
Whenever you're around (whenever you're around)
My heart's up in the clouds (my heart's up in the clouds)
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when you take my hand
I know you understand
Each and every time
Each and every time
