Give me an inch
I promise I'll take a mile
Danger is beauty
I'll face it with a smile

I'm on a mission
With no restrictions
Don't second guess myself
I'm born to be wild

I'm the type of chick
That likes to rock the beat
I like to rock the beat
I like to rock, to rock the beat

21st Century Girl
I do what I like
21st Century Girl
Iâm taking you for a ride
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

21st Century Girl
A beautiful life
21st Century Girl
Us walking side by side
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

Step on the breaks
Then I'mma step on the gas
I am a rebel
But I do it with class
I set the boundaries
The rules don't own me
I'm living life on the edge,
I choose my path

I'm the type of chick
That likes to rock the beat
I like to rock the beat
I like to rock, to rock the beat

I'm the kind of chick
That knocks you off your feet
That knocks you off your feet
That knocks you off, off your feet

21st Century Girl
I do what I like
21st Century Girl
Iâm taking you for a ride
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

21st Century Girl
A beautiful life
21st Century Girl
Us walking side by side
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

I feel like I can take over the world
If only I get my dreams out
Pull gold from my soul
Pull diamonds from my heart
It's that new girl thinking and this song is just the start!

21st Century Girl
I do what I like
21st Century Girl
Iâm taking you for a ride
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

21st Century Girl
A beautiful life
21st Century Girl
Us walking side by side
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up
