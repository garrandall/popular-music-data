Ring! Do you hear me callin'?
(Purps On The Beat)
Me no want no drama

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darlin'

Break away
And make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin'
When you're naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kiss it and I smoke it

Gots to be jokin'
Where in the fuck did you think you were goin'?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes
Like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
A wine-glass full of your emotions
Oh Pinot Grigio, sippin' beautiful
Heaven-soul woman

Me don't know, let me know
Let me in your heart
Don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
Inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your poster's on my wall
Inside my head, yeah, yeah

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darlin'

You drive me insane
No girl make me feel this way, wait
Girl, you got your ways
Girl, you are my getaway wait
Let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You're my main thing
Turn around, bang, bang

Hit the beach in L.A. like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo' truck
You start it up and skirt off
We park after dark at the park by the Mansion
Take your skirt off
Oh, me, can't wait to get all up inside of it

My heart is racin' every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate makin' love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feeling
Yes, girl, you the best, take away stress
You love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

Ring! Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me not want no drama
I just want you, my darlin'

Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
