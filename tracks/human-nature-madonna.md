Express yourself, don't repress yourself



And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (it's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (it's human nature)

You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I musta been crazy)
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
(What was I thinking)



You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breakin' all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)



Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I musta been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
(What was I thinking)



Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

(I'm not apologizing)
(Would it sound better if I were a man?)
(You're the one with the problem)
(Why don't you just deal with it)


(Would you like me better if I was?)
(We all feel the same way)
(I have no regrets)
(Just look in the mirror)


(I don't have to justify anything)
(I'm just like you)
(Why should I be?)
(Deal with it)
