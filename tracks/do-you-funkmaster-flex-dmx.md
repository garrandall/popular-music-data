(Intro)
That "T" would help though
Here we go again
Yeah, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all
Straight Y.O. mother f**kers

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me? And you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a f**k about me
Ain't about "Dog I wanna be just like you"
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every f**kin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine

Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

1 - Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable fo ryou
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about
