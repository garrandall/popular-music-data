I woke up this morning
My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin' to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink


Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of sayin' she's on my side
An unspoken message that works everytime
When my brain starts smokin'
And I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink



In this complicated world
It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure
Push to the limit
I'm standin' at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
