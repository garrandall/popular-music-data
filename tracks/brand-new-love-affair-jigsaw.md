Yes, it's like a brand new love affair
It's still like a brand new love affair
Cause we're still holding hands
And we're still making plans, oh
I still get butterflies
Each time I look in your eyes
It's still like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
That we don't share a brand new
Love affair, love affair, love affair
I saw you, I saw you last night
It was like the time when we first met
I held you, I held you last night
Like I did the night we won't forget
The first time I held you near
Felt my troubles disappear
That first day of our brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair
It's still like a brand new love affair
Cause we're still holding hands
And we're still making plans, oh
I still get butterflies
Each time I look in your eyes
It's still like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
We don't share a brand new
Love affair, love affair, love affair
I saw you, I saw you last night
It was like the time when we first met
I held you, I held you so tight
Like I did the night we won't forget
The first time I held you near
Felt my troubles disappear
That first day of our brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair
It's still like a brand new love affair
Cause we're still holding hands
And we're still making plans, oh
I still get butterflies
Each time I look into your eyes
It's still like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
We don't share a brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair
It's still like a brand new love affair
Cause we're still holding hands
And we're still making plans, oh
I still get butterflies
Each time I look in your eyes
It's still like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
That we don't share a brand new
Love affair, love affair, love affair
(Fade out)
