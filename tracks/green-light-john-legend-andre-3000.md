Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
Let's go

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now


I see you move
I'm checking your smile
Working your back like it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl

Dying to meet you
So let's mess around
I've got an obsession of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission so

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

We can go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

A 1, 2, 3 green light
But if it's what it seems like
The way you moving baby
Let's me know that it's gonna be right
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

A 1, 2, 3 red light
I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy
Help you study
Gets your head right
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

Do I have a girlfriend
Technically no
If you be my girlfriend
Then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition no other (no other)

Baby is just the thrill of the chase
But I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!
Baby I'm getting much closer
I just need permission so

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now!
I'm ready to go right now

We can go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

A 1, 2, 3 green light
But if it's what it seems like
The way you moving baby
Let's me know that it's gonna be right
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

A 1, 2, 3 red light
I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy
Help you study
Gets your head right
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now


So I went hard
Like Medusa staring at me
I told her let's go
Let's blow this lame nigga factory
She said what kind of girl
Do you think that I are
The kind that you meet in a bar
You think you can get
What ever you want 'cause you some kind of star

No I'm a comet
I just want you woman
Hey if I were you
It would be me that I go home with 3
The one and only
One thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl
"Oh, he can get it."

Admit it, you did it
Let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kidding we both going to where you're living
I got you giggling like a piglet
Oh that's the ticket
I hope you more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens

No I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style-freeing, free-styling
Which I seldom do
This what I'm telling you
To the bed I'm nailing you
Like I been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now


You got you one legend
Sometimes you gotta step from behind the piano
And let 'em know what's going on
Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes
I'm ready to go

We could go all night
Give me the green light

I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go right now
My men they can't wait
I'm ready to go right now
Participate

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
