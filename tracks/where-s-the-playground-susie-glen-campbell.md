The end has come
And found us here
With our toys
Scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found
An answer for
Still asks us, darlin'
Just what all the games were for?


And here we stand
In a box of sand


Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know
Her way around
Where's the playground Susie?
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?


The carousel
Has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two
And then it dropped us here
And still you're not content
With something about me?
But what merry-go-round
Can you ride without me?


To take your hand
How would you stand?


Where's the playground Susie?
If I decide to let you go
And play around?
Where's the playground Susie?
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?


Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know
Her way around
Where's the playground Susie?
If I decide to let you go
And play around?
