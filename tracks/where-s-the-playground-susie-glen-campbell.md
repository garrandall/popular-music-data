The end has come and found us here
With our toys scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found an answer for
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for
And here we stand in a box of sand
Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

The carousel has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
And still you're not content with something about me
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me
To take your hand?
How would you stand?

Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?
