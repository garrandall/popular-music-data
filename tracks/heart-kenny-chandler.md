Oh heart, how are you beating?
But her heart just ain't beating like you
Oh heart, you gotta watch out now
Or else she's gonna break intio
Oh heart, you better believe me
Save yourself for somebody new
Hm, don't make such a fuss
Theres no hope for us
She doesn't care the way that you do
Oh heart, please stop your pounding
To save yourself from something that's wrong
Oh heart, now don't let her hear you
Come on now you gotta be strong
Oh heart, you better believe me
Save yourself for somebody new
Hm, don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do
Let me tell you my heart
You're going crazy
Can you hear a word that I say
Oh heart, she doesn't want you
There's no reason I've been this way
Yes I'm telling you heart
You better believe me
Save yourself for somebody new
Hm, don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do
Yes I'm telling you heart
You better watch out
I'm telling you heart, heart, heart
Now watch out you heart, heart, heart
Come on now heart, heart, heart
You ohheart, heart, heart
You better watch out, heart, heart...
