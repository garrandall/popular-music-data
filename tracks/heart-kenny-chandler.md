Soreless and warring of fight for the shore
Borderline born to die overboard
And I do recall all the peace on the shore, but what for?

I've seen the dark between the stars
I've been to Mars, I'm sick of eating candy bars
A hopeful start turned into broken heart
So here's a toast the the goblins and the ghosts
Why did mom decorate my childhood room with boats?

Soreless and warring of fight for the shore
Borderline born to die overboard
And I do recall all the peace on the shore but what for?

I'm the shabby shoe chandler
The lighthouse, The lanterns who help all the phantoms return
I'm the merchandise handler, the paradise gambler the candle in the chandelier

So here's a toast to the things I love the most
Maybe she did it to help me stay afloat
Woah

Thoughts may contain different names
ohhhhhh
Don't let your brain with the fame
ohhhhhh
Oceans portray and escape
ohhhhhh
Don't you get caught in the waves
ohhhhhh

Swim to the light, Write your own story
The keys on the kite, no need to worry cause I'll be alright
And you'll be alright

Thoughts may contain different names
ohhhhhh
(Don't get caught in the )
Don't let your brain do the same
Oceans portray and escape
Don't you get caught in the waves
Oceans portray and escape
But don't you get caught in the waves
