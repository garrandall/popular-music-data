Girl you've had one of those days
Seems like they've been goin' around
You're a long way from bein' where you wanna be

When the world isn't goin' your way
Whatever bad luck is gettin' you down
Honey, I'll be right here for you
With open arms, you can run to me


Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight

We can go out and paint the town
We can dance your cares away
We can watch 'em all fall out on the floor

And if you want to we can close 'em down
And we can leave whenever you say
I'll chase you down the hallway
Watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door



That's the good thing girl about me and you
There ain't nothin' that lovin' can't get us through



Tonight, tonight, tonight
