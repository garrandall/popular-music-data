Cruisin on the grey snakes till my dyin day
Checkin all the hen houses out along the way
Wastin time and drikin wine
Life is short and I ain't lyin
Livin all I Can thru every day
You can call me Lucifer
If you think you should
Now I know I'm good
Everynight I'm barrelhousin till the moon is low
Shoutin blues and payin dues & throwin way my dough
Ramblin, Gamblin, Lovin, Shovin probably won't end up with nothin
But at least I'll reap the seeds I sow
You can call me Lucifer
If you think you should
Now I know I'm good
Funky water farmers daughter gonna make the law
Lucy Blue Chicago Green I'll love em till they thaw
Courtin all the lovely foxes, brunette, redheads, goldi locks
Talkin time to grind my crosscut saw
You can call me Lucifer
If you think you should
Now I know I'm good
