Cherish what is dear to you while it's near to you
Don’t wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what's dear to you while it’s near to you
Don't wait till it's gone

When I was a baby, mama rocked me in her arms whenever I cried
She picked me up when life knocked me
She was always there by my side
She said one, one day there'll be a man in your life
To take the place of a mother
Now he, he'll give you joy, a happy life
But swear by this advice:

Cherish what is dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what’s dear to you while it’s near to you
Don't wait till it’s gone

I strayed away from mama's advice
And lost the only man in my life
I never gave enough of myself
So he found love with somebody else
Now my lover is gone
'Cause I drove him to the arms of another love
I lost a love, was warm and tender, 'cause I failed to remember:

Cherish (what is) what’s dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what's dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone

(Instrumental break)

Cherish what is dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what's dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what's dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
Cherish (what is) what's dear to you while it's near to you
Don't wait till it's gone
