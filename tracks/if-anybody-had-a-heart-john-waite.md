In this world of right and wrong
The hardest part is beginning
By the time you find where you belong
You're either losing or winning 
Well I don't know how
But people seem to know
When you want somebody bad enough
Well I want you now
And wherever you go
I'm gonna love ya till you've had enough cause 
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine 
People treat you like
the clothes you wear
They only see what you show them
Let them talk baby I don't care
They don't know where we're goin' 
I love you so much
And I have for so long
How could anybody doubt it
Oh just one little touch
This love is so strong
Baby how can we live without it 
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine 
When you love somebody
You may stumble you may fall
But if you love somebody hard enough
Maybe you can get it all 
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine
Anybody in the world 
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine 
If anybody had a heart 
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine 
If anybody had a heart 
If everyone had a heart...
