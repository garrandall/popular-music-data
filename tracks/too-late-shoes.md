Every time I see you
I wish I could believe you
Do you ever mean a thing you say

You lied, I tried to overlook your careless way of love
And when you call I never turned you down

Too late, too late
Too late to see
Too late to let you run away

You're never serious
Although you're so impossible
I never understand the games you play

Break

Was it me that changed you, then
Or was it someone older
Are you ever lonely now and then

Every time I see you
I wish I didn't need you
Can you love or don't you even care

Too late, too late
Too late to see
Too late to let you run away

Too late, too late
Too late to see
Too late to let you run away

Oh, I should have known you'd slip away
