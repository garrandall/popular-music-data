When I first saw you
You were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows

Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home

You're a real fine lady
I know you know it too
You wanna be with me
And I wanna be with you

So why don't we get together
'Cause who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
And I ain't fooling you

Give me a chance
And I'll show you, baby
One little chance
Just to hold you

Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home

We'll have a good time, lady
Just you wait and see
I'm gonna fall for you
I hope you're gonna fall for me

And after a night together
I know you will agree
I know you will stay
For eternity

Yeah, you were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows

Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home

(My house would be your home)
You'd never have to roam
(You'd never have to roam)
Yeah, yeah

Give me a chance
And I'll show you
One little chance
Just to hold you

Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
(Come with me)
You'll never have to roam
Sad eyes, sad eyes, we're going home

You were a smile
That made rainbows
When I first saw you
Right then I knew

Sad eyes, oh, sad eyes
Sad eyes, take you home
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Sad eyes, you'll never have to roam
Sad eyes
