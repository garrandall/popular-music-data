A church house gin house
A school house outhouse
On Highway Number Nineteen
The people keep the city clean
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits

Twentyfive was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go t'the store on Friday
You go to church on Sunday
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits

You go t'the fields on week days
And have a picnic on Labor Day
You go to town on Saturday
But go to church ev'ry Sunday
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits

No whiskey for sale
You can't cop no bail
Saltpork and molasses
Is all you get in jail
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits

Little old town in Tennessee
That's called a quiet little old community
A one-horse town
You have to watch
What you're puttin' down in old Nutbush
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits
