Church-house gin-house 
School-house out-house 
On highway number nineteen 
The people keep the city clean 

They call it Nutbush 
Oh Nutbush 
Call it Nutbush City limits 

Twenty-five was the speed limit 
A motorcycle not allowed in it 
You go to school on fridays 
To go to church on sundays 

They call it Nutbush 
Oh Nutbush 
Call it Nutbush City limits 

You're gonna feel on weekdays 
And have a picnic on labour day 
You go to town on saturdays 
But go to church every sunday 

They call it Nutbush 
Oh Nutbush 
Call it Nutbush City limits 

There's no whiskey for sale 
You get caught no bail 
Soft port and molasses 
Is all you get in jail 

They call it Nutbush 
Oh Nutbush yeah Nutbush City limits
