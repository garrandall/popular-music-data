Left, right, in the middle of the night
We stay out late till we can't see straight
One, two, looking out for you
We'll be rocking up and down when the floor begins to shake

You, me, I need some company
Ask another girl if she'd like to take a chance
Yes, no, maybe she won't go
Do you wanna dance this dance with me?

Don't take that record it's lost its groove
Takes more than that to make me move
If you won't dance with me tonight
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can do it right.

Hot, cold, I'll never grow old
I've got fun on the brain
I've got life in my veins
Stop, go, what do you wanna know
I'm high as a kite I'm gonna dance all night

Up, down, I think I'm gonna drown
I've found the missing link when I've had a bit to drink
Quiet, loud, moving through the crowd
Do you wanna dance this dance with me?

Don't play record it's lost its groove
Takes more than that to make me move
If you won't dance with me tonight
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can do it right

Don't play that record it's lost its groove
Takes more than that to make me move
If you won't dance with me tonight
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can do it right

Hey, you, whatcha gonna do
You've got me down on my bended knees
You, me, I need some company
So do you wanna dance this dance with me?

Don't play that record it's lost its groove
Takes more than that to make me move
If you won't dance with me tonight
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can do it right

Don't play that record it's lost its groove
Takes more than that to make me move
If you won't dance with me tonight
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can,
I'll find another who can do it right
