Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah

I'm gonna start with the walls
Take the pictures off the walls
And burn 'em
Move the chairs around
Take the window curtains down
And burn 'em
Everything I see
Reminds me you were here
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah

The candlelabra set
You gave me on the night
Of my birthday
The records that you bought
The hi-fi we loved to play
The decorating man
Will come and rearrange them
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah

Take the carpet off the floor
Throw it out the door
It's filled with tears
Everything I find
That brings you to my mind
Must disappear
Every night I dream
I'll dream of someone new
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah, Mmm
Oh! Yeah, Mmm...
