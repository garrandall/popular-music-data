Thinking in square rooms, a human without illusions
Sad strains on a sad face, is that what we've come to?
Is the world bold this love old, moving nowhere and it's gonna cold
The wind stops, the clouds go, we're all alone


Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know, I can see those
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know, I can see those
I can feel those
I can see those


Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair


Walks long and long clears the vision
Of one with one and you still move me
You undo me like you've always done
But I realize now we've not made you out of words now
Just you and me, just you and me until the end of time


Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know, I can see those
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know, I can see those
I can feel those
I can see those


Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen, they don't care
If a man is in despair
