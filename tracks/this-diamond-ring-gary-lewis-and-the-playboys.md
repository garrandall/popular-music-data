Who wants to buy
This diamond ring?
She took it off her finger now
It doesn't mean a thing

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you've got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This stone is genuine
Like love should be
And if your baby's truer than
My baby was to me

This diamond ring can be something beautiful
And this diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
And then your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there's love behind it

This diamond ring can mean something beautiful
And this diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
And then your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there's love behind it

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you've got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
