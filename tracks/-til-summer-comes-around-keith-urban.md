Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'Til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'til you just might come back

But then I close my eyes and one more time,
We're spinning around and you're holdin' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth,
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
'Til summer comes around

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a ferris wheel rockin' with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And "Baby I'll be back again" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'Til summer comes around
