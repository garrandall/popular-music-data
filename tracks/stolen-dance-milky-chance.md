I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us


And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it


Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again


And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
