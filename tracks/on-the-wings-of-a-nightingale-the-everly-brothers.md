When I love,
I get a feeling like I'm travelling through the sky.
On the wings of a nightingale.

As I ride,
My head is reeling but I don't even wonder why
On the wings of a nightingale I'll fly

High above land and sea
I'll be thinking of you and me.
Couldn't ask for a better place to be
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening to me

So hold my hand,
I got a feeling that the journey has just begun.
On the wings of a nightingale.

And if you like,
we'll fly together to the land of eternal sun
On the wings of a nightingale of love

High above land and sea
I'll be thinking of you and me.
Couldn't ask for a better place to be
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening to me

When I love,
I get a feeling like I'm travelling through the sky,
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale fly
On the wings of a nightingale
