Ay, ay...
It's the King representin once more, ya understand?
When people see me on Bankhead..
Man the folks start pointin, screamin, and wavin, and yellin and...
I'm talkin' bout man, ay look mayne y'know I'm sayin..
I don't wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls, you dig what I'm sayin?
Y'all jump back up, let a pimp pass through, you dig?
Hahahahah!


Beamers, Bentley’s, double R’s, Ferrari’s
Every time I see you, shawty where ya headin tonight?
(Hey, where ya headin shawty?)
Sellin out arenas, chicks wit asses like Serena
Man, shawty live a hell of a life (I'm tryna tell ya shawty)
It's a hell of a liiiiiiiife man, shawty live a hell of a liiiiiife...
(That's how it is, real talk, true story)
I ain't tellin no liiiiie man, shawty live a hell of a liiiiife...
(That's how it is, real talk, true story)


Y'know, shawty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card? What you thank this cash for? (What?!)
Hit the dealership and give 'em every dime he ask for
Just so I can see two-hundred sixty on the dashboard
If shinin 'gainst the law, somebody better get the task force
For me, hoes love me, lemme fuck 'em 'til their ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money, go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for a hundred milli runnin
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin
I'm filthy rich and hungry, feel the grumblin in my stomach
I'm still stuntin off the chain, chasin nothin but some money
Put a couple pair of queens like I'm playin gin rummy
No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore Audemars, lookin' like I caught a star
Put it in her wristwatch, ballin like a big shot

Swag on fully, no semi, ho, hand me
Bankrolls, no pennies, drop Rolls (roles), no Emmy's
Street cred, no blemish, credit card, no limit
You went to Bankhead, spot a drop head, I'm in it!
And bendin, a couple corners, hoppin on 20
Wit three or four women givin love like tennis
My boxers where her chin is, giving me the business
While I'm ridin through the city, gag, swallow, no spittin
Livin life, like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
If yo' chick is in my sight, then that chick is gettin right
Ay, I know niggas now with bitches think I'm hittin it and they right
They keep my name up out dey mouth and mind dey business, dey aight
Hey aight, if you hear me say aight, okay, aight?
Cause you know I got dem goons with me and I pay aight
And they would like to see me broke or back to prison see me go
But instead they see me ballin, stuntin, everywhere we go - GO!

Money won't fold, pockets all swoll
Rubberband keep poppin off my bankroll
(I ain't tellin no liiiiie man, shawty live a hell of a liiiiife...)
(That's how it is, real talk, true story)
Brand new car fill my brand new chicks
A hunred bands right quick let's see ya man do this
(I ain't tellin no liiiiie man, shawty live a hell of a liiiiife...)
(That's how it is, real talk, true story)
