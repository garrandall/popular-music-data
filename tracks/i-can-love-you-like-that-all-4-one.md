They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way you felt when Romeo
Kissed Juliet
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more


I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that


I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Forever's what I mean
Well I'm no Cassanova
But I swear this much is true
I'll be holding nothing back
When it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes


I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that


If you want tenderness
I got tenderness
And I see through
To the heart of you
If you want a man
Who will understand
You don't have to look very far
I can love you
Girl, I can love you


I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that


I can, I can love you
Always kiss and hug you
Baby be mine
My one and only girl
My heart
My world
You're everything to me
I can, I can love you
If you let me love you
My one girl
