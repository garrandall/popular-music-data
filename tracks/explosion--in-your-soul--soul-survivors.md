A kiss from your lips
On a night like this
Like an explosion in my soul
Sweet love words
Something good to be heard
Like an explosion, can't control

And when I kiss
(Um hm)
I kiss you, baby
You know it's right
(Uh huh)
Drives me crazy

When the fuse is lit
And I know this is it
'Cause my soul starts burning
And my heart starts yearning

Like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, can't control
Just like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, way outta control

Your arms around me
Puts me in ecstasy
Like an explosion in my soul
If this feeling should end
Let's do it again
Like an explosion, can't control

And when I kiss
(Uh huh)
Kiss you, baby
You know it's right
(Yeah, heh)
Drives me crazy

When the fuse is lit
And I know this is it
'Cause my soul starts burning
And my heart starts yearning

Like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, I can't control
Just like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion way outta control

Like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, can't control
Just like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, way outta control

Like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, can't control
Just like an explosion in my soul
Like an explosion, way outta control
