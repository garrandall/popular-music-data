Midnight, that old clock keeps ticking,
The kids are all asleep and I'm walking the floor.
Darlin' I can see that you're dreaming,
And I don't wanna wake you up
When I close the door.

This old house of ours is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know what that means.
There's a garden outside she works in every day
And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Lately, I've been thinking 'bout daddy,
And how he always made things work, when the chips were down,
And I know I've got something inside me
There's always a light there to guide me
To what can't be found.

This old house of ours is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know what that means.
There's a swing outside the kids play on every day
And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.

Remember how we first came here together?
Standing on an empty lot, holding hands.
Later, we came back in the moonlight
And made love right where the kitchen is,
Then we made our plans.

This old house of ours is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know what that means.
There's a garden outside she works in every day
And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
