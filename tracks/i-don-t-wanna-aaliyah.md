Yeah
Mmm
Whoa
Oh yeah


I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone


When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like all we do is fight
Every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again
Do it over, can we straighten it out
Can we work it out, cuz...


I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone


Do you realize
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you
I can't even breathe without you...
I can't feel with out you, deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down...
Don't wanna go out cuz I can't ride without you
Feelin like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you


I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone


How can this be (that it's not workin out)
That it's not workin out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me that we don't talk no more
It's not supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes, but gotta carry on


I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone


Don't wanna live, no... No...
