So what are you doing back?

Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

I really mean that much to you?

Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
Your soft, silky hand ... long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's, oh, so true
Together we are one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality that I admire
To put it plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohI love you
Yes, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohlove you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions start up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice which rings in my ears
And stimulates my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotions, love, liking and joy
There's no need to blush, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you wear I don't care, how you dressed before
The reason that I like you, girl, is for what you are
If I sit and think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohlove you
Yes, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohlove you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love
Girl, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohlove you
Yes, you know it's true
Oh, oh oohlove you
