Wind tearin' through the backstreet, I hear the rhythm of my heart beat,
Rain blowin' to my face, I'm tired of being in the wrong place.

Blues knockin' on my back door, I can't jump from the second floor,
Turn up the radio higher and higher, rock and roll music set my ears on fire.

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.

Laid off work and I can't be free, I need some rock 'n' roll therapy.
Put on a 45 and let the needle ride, jukebox jumps and I'll be satisfied.

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.

Oh, let me ride on your mystery train, ride through the night in the pourin' rain.
Rock and roll in my soul, got me losin' control, let it roll!

Stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through,
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.



Rock and roll in my soul, got me losin' control,
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll!

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
(Stone blue) Walkin' on a backstreet,
(Stone blue) I hear the rhythm of my heartbeat.
(Stone blue) Pick up the beat 'n' start to run,
(Stone blue) I'll be home before the mornin' sun.
(Stone blue) Rain blowin' to my face,
(Stone blue) I'm tired of bein' in the wrong place.



When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
Turn up my radio, turn it up, yeah, higher and higher,
Turn it up, turn it up, whoo, yeah, higher and higher.



You gotta help me through - you gotta help me through,
You gotta help me through - you gotta help me through,
You gotta help me through - you gotta help me through,
You gotta help me through - you gotta help me through.
When I was stone blue, when I was stone blue,
Gotta help me through, help me through...
