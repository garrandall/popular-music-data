There comes a time in a man's life
When he's tired of the games messing
Around
He needs a good woman to settle down
And I'm at that time in my life
And I found what I needed in you

I swear I'll always be true
After searching and searching and
Searching
What treasure I found in you
So baby I'm ready say you'll be my lady
And I'll give my all to you

Chorus
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you I love you
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself

Chorus

I want us to have a family
A girl for you a boy for me
A great big old house
Baby just wait and see
I know you're wondering if I'm serious

Oh girl it's for real this feeling I feel
Do me a favor girl give me your trust
I've had time to think it over
And if you think that I'm letting you go
Baby you must be crazy I'm gonna let you
Know

Repeat Chorus two times

I ain't trying to find nobody
To take the place of you
'Cause there is no other girl
In the whole wide world
Who can do the things that you do

Oh baby I'll run around tellin all my
Friends
That I'll never find another like you again
I just can't help myself
And I don't wanna help myself

Repeat chorus two times
