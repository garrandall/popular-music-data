Last night we had an argument
Oh, oh, yes we did
Although baby, the things I said
I never meant

Girl, I'm so sorry
That I broke
Your tender heart
For we've come too far to end it now

You say you're satisfied
And we can leave things just like this
Oh, oh, baby, but what you don't realize is
Without your love I can't exist

So, please, oh, please
Have mercy on me
Can't you see
We've come much too far to end it now

We've come much too far to end it now
Ohh, baby now, I know, I know
There's much too there in store
Oh, yes it is oh, yes it is oh, yes it is

To ever think about ending this
Would be so very wrong
Oh, yes it is
Oh yes it is

We've had arguments before
But there's one thing you must know
That I think
We've come much too far to end it

Baby, don't ya know
I could never let you go
Baby, love you so gotta let ya know
We've come much too far to

Baby, come to me
Gotta make you see
We can make it last
Just like in the past
We've come much too far to end it
