Look for the light if you're lost in the night
I'll write your name on my door
If you ever need warmth and comfort
Darlin', I'll be here to hold you near

I heard your name
'Cause you'll be my security

Love is a house, you got the key
(Oh, to take me where I wanna be)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh), baby
(Just look and you'll see)
(Love is a house and you got the key)
Open up and let me into your heart, baby

Look in my eyes, there'll be no surprise
You'll find the window to love
And I'll do anything in my power
To welcome you and please you too

But deep in my heart (Deep in my heart)
I know you're the one for me

Love is a house, you got the key
(Oh, to take me where I wanna be)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh, yeah), baby
(Just look and you'll see)
(Love is a house, you got the key)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh, oh), baby

Love's a house, love's a home, I don't wanna be alone (No)
In your arms (Oh), I'm happy to be
Open up, let me in (Let me in), I'm hungry for your love again
You got the key (Oh), give it to me (Yeah)

When the night meets the morning

I'll hear you calling my name (TC)
And baby, you know if I answer
Things will never be the same (Never be the same)

But deep in my heart
I know that you're the number one for me

Love is a house, you got the key
(Woo, baby, take me where I wanna be)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh), baby
(Just look and you'll see)
(That you got the key)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh)

Love is a house, you got the key
(Love is a house, love's a home, I don't wanna be alone)
Open up and let me (Oh) into your heart (Open up), baby
(Open up, let me in, I'm hungry for your love again)
Open up and let me into your heart (Oh, darlin')

Love is a house, you got the key (Oh...oh...oohohoh)
You got the key (Oh, oh...)
Love is a house, you got the key (Oh...)
You got the key (To take me where I wanna be)

Love is a house, love's a home (Oh...), I don't wanna be alone
In your arms, I'm happy to be (Oh, yeah)
Open up (Open up, baby), let me in, I'm hungry for your love again (Oh)
You got the key (Hey, hey), give it to me

Love is a house (Your love is a house)
Love is a house (Your love is a house)
Love is a house (Love is a house)
You got the key (And you got the key)
You got the key (Just come on home)
