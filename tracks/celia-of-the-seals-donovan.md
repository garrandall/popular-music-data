Should you wander this land to the North,
And few seldom do,
Should you follow the song of the gull
To enchanted western isles,
Coax a fisherman to take you out
Where the silky seals are seen,
Hear the stories that they tell about
The maiden who is their queen,
The maiden who is their queen.
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals.
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
Seal hunters are not brave and bold,
They murder her poor wee seals
And cut off their skins to be sold,
Cursed be he who deals.
There's no reason for this slaughtering,
They're left on the rocks to bleed
He's not a man who does this thing,
It's a cruel and a heartless deed,
A cruel and a-heartless deed.
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals.
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
