What's he doin' in my world what's he doin' holdin' my world
If he's not more than just a friend why were you kissin' him
And what's he doin' in my world

What's he doin' in my world did you tell him that you're my girl
If your love is really true tell him my world's made for two
What's he doin' in my world

Oh, don't let me keep on wonderin' just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love loves somebody new

What's he doin' in my world we don't need him here in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend explain those kisses you gave him
And what's he doin' in my world
