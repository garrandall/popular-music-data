Posted with that pump (I'm posted, pump)
Relay with that pump (Uh, race, race-race)
Posted with that pump (Uh, yuh, ayy, ayy)
Relay with that pump (Uh, okay, race, race-race)
Revenge on my body, mhm (Uh, revenge, we are very much in this motherfucker)
She want meet my shawty, mhm (Uh, my back)
Revenge on my body, mhm (Uh)
Oh my god, Ronny (Bitch, woo, yuh)


Dick gon' hurt her stomach (Dick-dick, yeah), she gon' need a Tums (Ooh)
Plummeted from the solar (Yuh, ooh), put me on your gums (Oh, oh, okay)
Still got jacked like cactus (Oh, oh, okay), there's quarter stars on my necklace (Oh, oh, okay)
I be on my South Park shit, smokin' the cat piss (Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke)
Rest in peace, X, that's vro, and we don't forget shit (Ayy, ayy)


That mean I shoot backwards, backwards (Ayy, bitch)
That mean I shoot backwards (Yuh, chills)


Motherfucker I be blackin' out, be matchin' out
The color of my whips so beat, be blackin' out
A bundle to my money ain't really perpetual
These niggas got no spine (Spine), we call 'em a vegetable (Yah)
Your bitch call me tic-tac-toe, she get the X and O's (Woo)
Hugs and kisses for when I tow my little boat (Yeah)
Look at the top of my head, horns grown, goat
Bill Nye the Science Guy, Fendi white lab coat (Hahaha)

I'm a nicotine soldier, say, "Drink cyanide" (What? What?)
Finger fuckin' my luck, fuck a four-leaf clover (What? What?)
Bent the world over, I'm ready to die tonight (What? What?)
Bad chicks at the ice on my shoulder (What? What? What? Ayy)

Carbonated water
Nigga been poppin' like a cherry Coke soda that is shook in October
Wonder what told you to make you bend under pressure like the fucker was a folder


That mean I shoot backwards (Huh?), backwards (Huh?)
That mean I shoot backwards (Okay)


Slit wrist on a bitch, had to slaughter *******
Pussy makin' sounds like a otter tail in water
Why you try to hit me? Like I was a driver
Lucky things on me, nigga, like I play Frogger
Yes I try to lick her, I'ma egg nog her
Try to kick it with her, Messi, no soccer
Spongebob pet, Gary, I'm a slimy motherfucker
Lookin' for a Fairly Odd mother, like my name Crocker
Green Goblin, no, the Grinch, stealin' out the stockings
How to dance, the chick from Grease, the pot's stole, made from Crocker
Oh, the teeny bop, pull-up like a diaper on a toddler (Huh, huh)
Hit strong like a linebacker, Brian Urlacher (Okay)
Witches, Harry Potter (Huh)
I'm very conspicuous (Yuh, yuh), maybe it's 'cause I'm the type to be a martyr (Yeah)
Death before dishonor (Huh), keep the blade on me
I'm the type to give the heebie-jeebies to the Holy Father (Huh)
Like Davey Jones locker (Yeah), wrist wetter than a fuckin' flounder
Can you pretty please pass me the tartar?
Where's authenticity, need to have order (Need to have it)
Niggas finessin' the swag, bag, yeah, you bought it (Aye, yuh)


That mean I shoot backwards (Huh? What), backwards (Okay)
That mean I shoot backwards (Water)


I'm a nicotine soldier, say, "Drink cyanide"
Finger fuckin' my luck, fuck a four-leaf clover
Bent the world over, I'm ready to die tonight
Bad chicks at the ice on my shoulder

Carbonated water
Nigga been poppin' like a cherry Coke soda that is shook in October
Wonder what told you to make you bend under pressure like the fucker was a folder
Money my odor, sunsets, manifest
Must be something in the fucking Florida water


That mean I shoot backwards, backwards
That mean I shoot backwards
Race, race-race
