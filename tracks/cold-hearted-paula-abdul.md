He's a cold-hearted snake (girl)
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool now

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off and runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?

He's a cold-hearted snake (girl)
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool now

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check
That you were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl
With him there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake (girl)
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool now

You could find somebody better, girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better, girl
He's c-cold as ice

He's cold as ice
He's cold as ice

Stay away from him, girl

Cold-hearted
Cold-hearted snake
Cold-hearted
Cold-hearted snake

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool

Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Girl, don't play the fool

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
