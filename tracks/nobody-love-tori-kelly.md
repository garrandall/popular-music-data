(Okay, okay)
(Why, why)
(Okay, okay)


Everybody's looking for that something (Okay, okay)
No one ever wants to pay the price (Okay, okay)
Everyone is scared of going nowhere (Okay, okay)
But we ain't going anywhere tonight (Okay, okay)


I should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
(To feel this good when I'm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say "I hate you", but I always stay
Woah, oh, oh, cause


Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do


Everybody's talking bout the next thing
Feel like what they got ain't good enough (oh, oh yeah)
But all I wanna do is release the tension (all right, all right)
Bring the conversation back to us (oh yeah)


I should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
(To feel this good when I'm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say "I hate you", but I always stay
Woah, oh, oh, cause


Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do


Can we stop all the yelling baby, hear me out
I want you here and now
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Hey, hey, hey-ey! Oh yeah!
Yeah, all right, everybody’s looking for that new thang
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody love

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do

Ain't nobody love, ain’t nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain’t nobody love like you do
