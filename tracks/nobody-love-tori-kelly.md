(Why, why)

Everybodyâs looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ainât going anywhere tonight

I should be more cynical and tell myself itâs not okay
(To feel this good when Iâm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Woah, woah, woah cause

 
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do

Everybodyâs talking âbout the next thing
Feel like what they got ainât good enough
But all I wanna do is release the tension
Bring the conversation back to us

I should be more cynical and tell myself itâs not okay
(To feel this good when Iâm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Woah, woah, woah cause

 
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do

Can we stop all the yelling baby hear me out
I want you here and now
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Hey, hey, heyâ¦
Yeah, alright, everybodyâs looking for that new thing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ainât nobody, nobody, nobody love
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you do
Ainât nobody love, ainât nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
