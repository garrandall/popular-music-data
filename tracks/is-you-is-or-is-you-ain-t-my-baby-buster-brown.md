We come that gangsta shit, nigga! {"WHOOO! WHOOO!}
Ca$hville's in the "Philldid".
We at the way! Nigga I'm on my way!
G-UNIT! G-UNIT! G-UNIT! {G-UNIT RADIO...}Â¸
POW! Fuck if... {...KING OF NEW YORK!}
This is the nigga's act like, they want beef; I guess what muthafuckas!


Somebody came to die y'all (yeah!)
If I was you, I'd hit that nigga from beside y'all. 
Hey yo, I'm drunk 'bouts ta get his head bust
Shit we came in this club to get put out nigga what. WHO DA FUCK!?
WHO DA FUCK!? Bitch I can get it crunk - make a gangsta
Take ya outside pop tha trunk; (BOO!) hit ya up.
Dirrty South representin wit' these screamz these niggaz
Bouncin' wit' these Valet ridaz
Yakno'whatImean? Nigga I keep it hood,
Khakis in black hoodz. (A'ight!)
Two Glockz on my waist boy I wish a nigga would, let me get 'em first! 
Shits gettin' worst (OH!)
I aint come here to spit a verse. (OH!)
I'm here it tha put in work! I'm here it to put in merk! (BLAT!)
Follow me thru these war grounds,
Look around see my pockets gettin' torn down; FUCK IT NOW!
I'ma pop 'til I get popped cook 'til it turned rock
Kill me a nigga and {NONE!} go smoke {NONE!} a blunt wit' Pac. - I'MA GANGSTA! {NONE STOP!}


Home boyz all we see is Southbound
wit' a AK to hold a hundred roundz. 
You know how I get down! 
G-Unit in this bitch is home now
Lemme see ya stomp a hata to the ground (PO!)
You know how I get down! (PO!)

Home boyz all we see is south bound
Wit' a AK to hold a hundred roundz  {CAN WE GET...}
You know how I get down!
G-Unit in this bitch is home now {?? !}
Lemme see ya stomp a hata to the ground.
You know how I get down...


Take me to tha bounce (wha'?) - I just popped it off (HUH?)
This rap shit ain't quick enough wen these wordz come out. (A'ight!)
We call 'em crack houses - that's were we count them stacks
New York call 'em spotz ATL got a couple printz. {SHADYVILLE!!}
We drive big trucks! (C'MON!) We sit on big grillz! (C'MON!)
What I'm sayin' is? I was good if I don't get a deal. (NIGGA WHAT?)
Back to these hatin niggaz actin' like they want drama
I do like Jigga did and fuck you niggaz baby mama. 
Ridin' clean shit spinnin' on that Mazarati (whoo!!)
Smokin' that California bangin' that ladie-dadie! (YEAH! HUH!)
And nigga 50 told me: "Get what you done came for!"
I handle the rest. - Whatchu think my name for? {Whoooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiid!}
Actin' like that shit ain't never happen tull them bullets comin' at 'em, 
Bitch smack on 'em - G-Unit ain't only rappin'! (GUH!)
So come on down - to tha price is right
And you can get it in Brown nigga green or white. - YOUNG BUCK!


Home boyz all we see is Southbound
wit' a AK to hold a hundred roundz.  {DAMN!}
You know how I get down! 
G-Unit in this bitch is home now
Lemme see ya stomp a hata to the ground {"SHADYVILLE.BIZ"!}
You know how I get down!

Home boyz all we see is south bound
Wit' a AK to hold a hundred roundz
