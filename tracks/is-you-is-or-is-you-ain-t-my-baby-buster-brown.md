Woo!
Woo!

I've got a gal who's always late
Ev'rytime we got a date
But I love her
Yes, I love her

Well now, I'm gonna walk
Right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
Ev'rytime I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Well now, but is you is or is you ain't my baby?

And the way you actin' lately
Makes me doubt
Well, are but you, still my baby, baby?

Well, now it seems my flame
In your heart is done gone out

Now, a woman who is a creature
Who that has always been strange
Now when you're sure the one you'll find
Girl, has made a change of mind

Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby?

Well, for maybe baby
You'll find somebody new
Or but is my baby
Still my baby, true?
Am I?

Woo
Wa-oh!

Woo!

Woo!

Woo!

FADES-

Baby, will have a brand new start
