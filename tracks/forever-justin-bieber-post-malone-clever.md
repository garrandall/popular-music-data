Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushing a Monte Carlo
Bet the money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh no
See them heat waves in the desert look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me
Keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missing
Been missing the way you give me envision, babe

Never thought I'd settle down
Reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusing on being by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothing left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together?
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother?

Girl, you're killing me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally
But I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest
Your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Counting the stars with our last name on the license plate
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feeling aside
Let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around

Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
