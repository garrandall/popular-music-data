Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home giving crowds what they wantin
Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin
Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said: "Yo we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five, is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously, within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music running through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listening start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelphi
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short "I want it made" like Ed, nuff said
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuing to


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
