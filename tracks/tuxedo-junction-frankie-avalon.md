Way down south in Birmingham
I mean south in Alabam
There's an old place where people
Go to dance the night away

They all drive or walk for miles
To get blues, that southern style
Slow blues that makes you want
To dance away the day

It's a junction
Where the town folks meet
At each function
In their best, they greet you

Come on down
Forget your cares
Come on down
You'll find me there
So long town
I'm heading for
Tuxedo Junction now

X2

I'm heading for
Tuxedo Junction now

Come on down
Come on down
Come on down
Come on down
