Alright, I'm ready now, ready now
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna fall back down now
Alright, I'll take it on, take it on me
Take it on me, hm, baby

All I ever ask, ever ask
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my lover
Tonight, and take it with, take it with me
Take it with me

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

Alright, I'm ready now
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna stop right now, no
Alright, I'll take it on, take it on me
Take it one me, ohbaby

All I ever ask, ever ask is
Do you wanna, do you wanna see my fire
Tonight, and take it with, take it with me
Take it with me, hm baby?

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind, nevermind
