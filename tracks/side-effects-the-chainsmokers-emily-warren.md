It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

That oh the side effect to my loneliness is you

Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

But, oh if late night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Oh I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line

Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
I, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Oh you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah
