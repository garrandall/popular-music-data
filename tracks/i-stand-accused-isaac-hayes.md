I stand accused
Of lovin' you too much
And I hope, I hope it's not a crime
'Cause if it is, I'm guilty
Of lovin' you, you, you

I, I hope to God
That I never have, oh, to testify
'Cause if I do
Everyone is gonna, they're gonna cry
They're gonna say
 is guilty
Of lovin' a sweet girl like you

I know, I know
You belong to another
I, I may not stand a ghost of a chance
I'll stand on top of Mount Everest
And proudly tell the world that I love ya
Oh yes, I will

Because I, I just can't
I can't help myself
I'm a victim of circumstance

And just one
Ooh, one touch of your hand
I don't know how it happened
But just look at me
I find myself chillin'
On the witness stand

And I'm shoutin' out
All over, all over the land

I'm guilty of lovin', lovin' you

I'm guilty of lovin' you
I said, I'm guilty
But what can I do?
I wanna hold ya
I wanna squeeze ya tight
But my mind said
She belong to another
And that ain't right
