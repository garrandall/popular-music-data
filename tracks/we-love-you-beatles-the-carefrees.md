We love you, Beatles
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Beatles
And we'll be true

When you're not near to us
We're blue
Oh, Beatles, we love you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We love you, Ringo
Oh, yes, we do
No matter where you go
We'll follow you

When you're not near to us
We're blue
Oh, Ringo, we love you

We love you, John
Oh, yes, we do
We love the things you say
So wacky too

When you're near to us
We're Blue!
Oh, John, we love you

We love you, Beatles
Oh, yes, we do
We don't love anyone
As much as you

Your singing makes
Us say to you
Oh, Beatles, we love you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We love you, Paul
Oh, yes, we do
We love the way you smile
You send us too

When you're not near to us
We're blue
Oh, Paul, we love you

We love you, George,
Oh, yes, we do
You're always in our hearts
And we bless you

When you're not near to us
We're blue
Oh, George, we love you

We love you, Beatles
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Beatles
And we'll be true

When you're not near to us
We're blue
Oh, Beatles, we love you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
