Surfing every day down at Malibu
Neath the warm California sun
No more books, no more
Homework to do now
Cause summer means fun


Summer means fun (fun, fun)
(Summer means fun now)
Summer means fun (and the
Girls are two to one now)
The girls are two to one
(Lots of fun for everyone now)
Yeah, summer means fun
(Fun, fun, summer means fun now)

Drive-in movies every night
Staying out 'til half past one
Sleeping late and
Living right now
Cause summer means fun



Yeah, summer means fun (fun, fun)
(Summer means fun now)
Summer means fun (and the
Girls are two to one now)
Summer means fun
(Lots of fun for everyone now)

So everybody, grab
Your baggies and bikinis
Cause it's only just begun
We're gonna have a ball
Until the fall now
Cause summer means fun

Summer means fun (fun, fun)
(Summer means fun now)
Summer means fun (and the
Girls are two to one now)
The girls are two to one
(Lots of fun for everyone now)
Yeah, summer means fun

Yeah, summer means fun (fun, fun)
(Summer means fun now)
Summer means fun (and the
Girls are two to one now)
Summer means fun
(Lots of fun for everyone now)

Yeah, summer means fun (fun, fun)
(Summer means fun now)
Summer means fun (and the
Girls are two to one now)
Summer means fun
(Lots of fun for everyone now)...
