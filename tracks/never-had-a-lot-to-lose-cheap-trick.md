I don't need no money, honey
Fortune and fame
'Cause I got all the riches, baby
That one man can claim
So take off your coat and close the door
Forget about your pride
I'm not afraid of falling down
Or staying up all night
You're gonna see it my way now
Don't try to bring me down
My life's a circus, an insane chain of circumstances
I never had a lot to lose
I never let it slow me down
I never had a lot of love now, honey
Never had a lot to lose
I can't explain the time it takes
To make you understand
I know you'll get to like it 
If you only get the chance
I hope I get some time tonight
To see you comin' 'round
What can I give you in return
For one night on the town

But not till daylight, not till daylight, not to daylight
daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I tried to tell you
It's a pain you can't hide
My life's a circus
An isane chain of circumstances
I never had a lot of love
I never had too much money
I never let it slow me down now, honey
I never had a lot to lose
