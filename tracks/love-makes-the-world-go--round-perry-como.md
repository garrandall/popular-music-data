(Yea, Yea and a Yea, Yeah!) Yes! 

There's been a lot of talk about the game of love, 
It's what everybody, everywhere, is thinking of! 
The love bug's busy as he can be, 
And I gotta a funny feeling that he just bit me! 


âCause love makes the world go âround and around. 
Love makes the world go âround! 
Your pulse will beat and your heart will pound, 
âCause love makes the world go âround! 

I met a little guy about four feet small, 
Who fell in love with Annie who was eight feet tall! 
Every time I see âem comin' down the street, 
I know true love just can't be beat! 



A goose got loose at the county fair, 
They looked high and low but she wasn't there! 
Up jumped a gander who said leave her alone, 
When she misses old Dad, she'll come back home! 
âCause love makes the world go âround... (and âround and âround!) 

No matter what you do or where you go, 
You get kinda lonely when the lights are low! 
Everybody's gotta have a love that's true, 
And I just gotta have you, you, you! 

âCause love makes the world go âround and around. 
Love makes the world go âround! 
Your pulse will beat and your heart will pound, 
âCause love makes the world go... 
Love makes the world go... 
Love! Makes the world go round! 
Yea, Yea and a Yea, Yeah!
