There's been a lot of talk about the game of love
Its what everybody, everywhere, is thinking of!
The love bugs busy as he can be
And I gotta a funny feeling that he just bit me!


Cause love makes the world go round and around
Love makes the world go round!
Your pulse will beat and your heart will pound
Cause love makes the world go round!

I met a little guy about four feet small
Who fell in love with Annie who was eight feet tall!
Every time I see em comin' down the street
I know true love just can't be beat!


A goose got loose at the county fair
They looked high and low but she wasn't there!
Up jumped a gander who said leave her alone
When she misses old dad, shell come back home!
Cause love makes the world go round ( and round and round! )

No matter what you do or where you go
You get kinda lonely when the lights are low!
Everybody's gotta have a love that's true
And I just gotta have you, you, you!

Cause love makes the world go round and around
Love makes the world go round!
Your pulse will beat and your heart will pound
Cause love makes the world go
Love makes the world go
Love! makes the world go round!
Yea, yea and a yea, yeah!
