So I made 'em a anthem to make some dividends
Lil' mama try hit me with that shoulder lean
This cut co Crack and I control the team
Couple bricks stacked on that triple beam
My dirty bro sippin' that promethazine
That ganja green, that Cali weed
A nigga lose his life tryna roll on me
Now, yup yup, we get it, no if ands about it
And the rain keep fallin', even when it's droughted


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a hand full of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I'm in this bitch with the Terror

She gets it poppin' with no hands, I make it pour
I make it rain on 'em, I'm layin' game to 'em
I got some misses to tattoo my name on 'em
Gotta get that baby love, gotta get my paper up
Got a stay strapped asap case y'alls hate Crack and wanna rain on us
And you know what it is, yeah it's them powder kids
And we know how to bid, so we don't give a shit
