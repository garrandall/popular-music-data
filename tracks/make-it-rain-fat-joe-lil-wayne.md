Whoo! 
Roxanne, (Its Khals bitches! Owww!) You don't have to turn off your red light... 

 
Static! 
Let's make it rain on these niggaz (Remix!) 


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror (Remix)
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain (Remix)
I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes (Listennn)


I'd be drilling these chicks like Major Payne
When i make it rain
they'd be like, "Yo, do it again!"
from the club to the coupe inside my gates
up in my bedroom screaming each others name
They was perty perty (perty)
and I was flirty flirty (flirty)
Lil' Dro, Lil' Bub now they gettin durty durty (durty)
don't ask me what my name is 
stupid bitch I'm famous
You gon make me aim this
Leave yo ass brainless
I'm tryna stay R&B 
but these streets is a part of me
So don't get it twisted
You see order 1 bottle 
then I fuck with 1 model 
then I order more bottles
now I got more models
I'm from that city where them niggaz don't play man
I take a chick to my room like caveman
So ask ur girlfriend my name
I bet she go "Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, weatherman bout to make it rain


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror (Remix)
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain (Remix)
I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 


Blat Blat Blat Blat Hey Joey lemme get em
Its young money and we on like the television
The weather channel but I do not broadcast
I throw up more cash
and change the forecast
Your boyfriend is lame
I make it rain on ya
he never make it rain 
like Southern California
wheres ur umberella
now getcha raincoat
baby I make it flood now u gon need a boat

 
Fresh to death on 'em 
We throwin' money on 'em 
Stay fly, 25s when we ride on 'em 
Alligator suede, custom with the shades 
Make it snow in the club, bitches know we paid 
Stay shy rockin' Gucci in the Bentley (Super fly) 
White Rolls for my broad on them 23s 
Goin' to the club, nigga in a new fleet 
All red doors up, doin' it like a real G 


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror (Remix)
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain (Remix)
I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 

 
Come see me and Crack in the club flossin' 
40 cal in my jacket, 20 stacks in my jeans 
No real boss niggaz do real boss things 
We bout that shit, you just talkin' 
Young Sam Rothstein out with my goons 
In the 430 down the strip I zoom
in the drop of January but it feel like June
Big glock I carry make a real big BOOM 
Make moves like a young tycoon 
I come through like a young typhoon 
Category 3, don't be categoring me nigga
Like you can get a better salary than me ah
El Capitan, King, Numbero Uno 
I flood pussy clubs, ask any stripper you know

 
Ace mizzy get all the hoes 
Gotta teach them shit they want to know 
Like fuck that pussy ass 9 to 4 girl 
Make that bucket a pot of gold 
It ain't no money like hustle money 
It ain't no bitch like a hustle bunny 
Ain't no bitch gettin' none of my money 
That why the money gotta clip to protect it for me 
She gotta ride for the A, hop for the A 
Live for the minute or be out for the day 
Pop the metal while lookin hot in stilettos 
Gotta rock on the bezzle of the trigger finger 
Boss bitch of the ghetto, my Spanish Trina 
Talk shit to a nigga with the 'blama beamed up 
When I see her gotta handle my B
I gotta give her one of these in the back of the team truck


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror (Remix)
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain (Remix)
I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 

Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, Make it rain, 


I be reppin my city 
Blowin hundreds and fiftys 
If the head right, Ricky there every night 
Joey I was listenin' 
pullin up spinnin' rims 
Time to spend some dividends 
My money they swimmin' in 
Ross, I'm a boss (I'm a boss) I'm the mayor (I'm the mayor) 
Make it rain (Make it rain!), on these haters (on these haters!) 
Get your umbrella fella, cause we blowin' 
hella chedda, I'm the nigga that you scared of 
Cause no one can do it better 

 
Joe Crack girly 
80s crack baby's momma paid me 
Maybach, fly Mercedes 
Twerk that, drop it baby 
Them perty ladies, they drive me crazy 
Them skies is hazy, I'll pop like 80 
Somebody tell Mr. Bentley to bring his umbrella 
Katrina not, its just a one fella 
Who got dumb chedda, and need a brain surgeon 
Got me a designated thrower, cause my hand's hurtin' 
I make it rain, its coca bitch 
It's not a game, them Vatos Locos rich 
Ain't nothing wrong with wanting a little happy ending 
And we don't need a hotel, we parkin lot pimpin' 
Bitch! 


Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror (Remix)
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain (Remix)
I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes 
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
