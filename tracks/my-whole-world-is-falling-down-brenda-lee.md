My whole world is falling down, falling down, falling down
My whole world is falling down, I'm losing my baby

Told me that your love for me was true
Said you'd love me your whole life through
But now you're asking me to set you free
You've found some body you love more than me

My whole world is falling down, falling down, falling down
My whole world is falling down, I'm losing my baby

I miss your loving that was so fine
I need it, I need it all of the time
For I still love you in the same old way
Yet I'm losing you a little every day

My whole world is falling down, falling down, falling down
My whole world is falling down, I'm losing my baby

My whole world is falling down, falling down, falling down
My whole world is falling down, I'm losing my baby
