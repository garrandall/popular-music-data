Lonely Saturday night
No place to go
No friends in sight
The girl I wanted to see
Was much too busy for me
On a lonely Saturday night

Everybody I know
Has a date
Or some place to go
A movie on your own
Is just no fun alone
On a lonely Saturday night

Watching other guys
Having their dates
Living it up
Having a ball yeah
I bet that somewhere
There must be a girl
Just sitting at home hoping someone will call on a lonely Saturday night
No place to go
No friends in sight
The girl I wanted to see
Was much too busy for me
On a lonely Saturday night
