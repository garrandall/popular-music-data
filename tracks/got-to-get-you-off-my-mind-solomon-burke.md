Got to get you off of my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
You've found somebody new
And our romance is through
Yes it is

Gonna throw your picture away
You didn't want my love, any old way
You've found somebody new
And our romance is through
Yes it is

Some folks love is hard and strong
That's the kind of love that lingers on
Some folks love is swift and fast
That's the kind of love that'll never last

We had a love that was in between
And to me it was like a dream
If we had stayed together till June
Not a problem, bride and groom

That's why
Got to get you off of my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
You've found somebody new
And our romance is through
Listen to me

Got to get you off of my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
Got to get you off of my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
