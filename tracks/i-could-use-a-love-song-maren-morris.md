Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I'm just getting old
Used to work but now it don't

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don't know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That'll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now the magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't working
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah it's hurting but it ain't dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song
