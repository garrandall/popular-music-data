I don't sit and worry
Where  my man spends his time
I  close my ears to gossip
About that man of mine
Cleaned up woman
May  be a threat
But  I ain't met no woman
Who could take my place yet

If  you can beat me rocking
You can have my chair
If you can beat me rocking
Have my chair
I'll  be glad to get on up
If my love ain't good enough
If you can love him better
Then you belong together
Yeah yeah

He may be tipping
That they all may do
But I ain't worried
About losing him to you
I'm doing my job
Seven days a week
I don't fret no woman
Taking my seat

If you can beat me rocking
You can have my chair
If you can beat me rocking
Take my chair
I've been as close to him
As his brother
Giving him more tenderness
Than he got from his own mother

I believe I want to say it again
Now listen just
I'll be glad to get on up
If my love ain't good enough
If you can love him better
Then you belong together

If you can beat me rocking
You can have my chair
If you can beat me rocking
You gotta take my chair
If you think you rougher
I'm a little bit tougher
Beat me rocking
And take my chair
I'll move aside
And I'll let you by
I'll get on up
If you think you're good enough
