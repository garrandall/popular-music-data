Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track
Theres a girl down by the railroad tracks
Used to carry coal on her back
'til she met that gentleman Jack
That Lazy Elsie Molly
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track
Elsie Molly been a lookin' so fine
She won't go to work in the mine
She lays in bed till eight or nine
That Lazy Elsie Molly
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track
Dut Dut Dut..
A put the pack back on your back
Jack and Elsies been a struttin' around
He bought her a wig and a purple gown
Now shes the best dressed miner in town
That Lazy Elsie Molly
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track
 Ah huh huh
Girl a put that pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track

Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
A put the pack back on your back
Lazy Lazy Elsie Molly
Carry it on down to the railroad track...
