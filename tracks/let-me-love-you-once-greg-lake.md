When there's something I can't have
I only want it more
You know I sure found out the hard way
That it's true
'Cause there's a storm inside of me
From wantin' you
How I wish that I'd found you in time
'Cause now you're his and can't be mine

But you can start a fire raging
Just by touching me
Even though I know
We're not supposed to touch
Oh, I've never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first
Can't you see my heart's about to burst

So let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door
And open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you
Since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

And let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door
And open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you
Since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

And let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me
No one's ever gonna love you more than me
No one's ever gonna love you more than me
