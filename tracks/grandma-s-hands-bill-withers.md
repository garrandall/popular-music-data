Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played the tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say, âBilly don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grassâ
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands sooth the local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, âBaby Grandma understands
That you really loved that man
Put yourself in Jesus' handsâ
Grandma's Hands

Grandma's hands used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands, boy the really came in handy
She'd say, â Mattie don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple coreâ
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
Um,mm,mm
