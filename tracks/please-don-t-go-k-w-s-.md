Hey, I know we havent spoken much I just um, wanted to tell you that I wanted to see you and Im sorry that it didnt work out things just aint the same you know, well, let me explain


We used to talk alot
Now we hadley even speak
Harldey even kiss
Havent made love in weeks
My heart is getting weak
Girl it hurts me deep
Im thinkin should I stay
Or maybe should I leave


Youve been wondering how I feel
You dont know
Been wondering why im here
I dont know
Is this what we both feared
We dont know
Is the end to this near?
Our hearts say no


It used to be so right
We used to be a team
Talk long everynight
We used to share our dreams
I miss those little things
Its been so long it seems
But I know I shouldnt leave
Cause only you got what I need





I've packed up all my things girl and I really need to go now

Baby no I'll go crazy

I love you but I can't live like this can't take it no more now

Please listen to me

You've been actin' different always trippen it's out of control now

We're havin' a baby

Oh my god I'm sorry girl come and take my hand now I understand
