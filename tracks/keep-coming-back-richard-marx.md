You know just how to hurt me
And how to take all the pain away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise
There were times, I think you knew
When I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes

You know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else can see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby
I don't know why I keep coming back to you
To you baby

You say we shouldn't be lovers
And I say we can't just be friends
And all this talking just makes me want you more
You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby
Tell me why I keep coming back to you

I'm so in love, so in love with the games that you play
So in love, and nothing can keep me away

You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby
I don't know why I keep coming back to you
To you baby
