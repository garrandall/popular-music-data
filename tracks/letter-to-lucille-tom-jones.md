Somebody, please, if somebody will
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing her still
I think about her constantly

Somebody, please, if somebody can
Let them take a letter from this lonely man
All I ask is Lord, make her understand
I'll die if she don't wait for me

I heard a rumor from the guys in Cell A
You've served your time and you are leaving today
Well, there is something you can do
For me to help your old friend
Help me, please
'Cause I've got seven years in this old pen
Till I'm home again

Somebody, please, if somebody will
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing her still
I think about her constantly

Somebody, please, if somebody can
Let them take a letter from this lonely man
All I ask is, Lord, make her understand
I'll die if she don't wait for me

To hear you tell it, you're all innocent men
But I was guilty, and I'd do it all again
Just to hold her for a minute or two
I'd steal a king's crown, yes, I would
If I don't reach that girl some way, I know
There'll be another man around

Somebody, please, if somebody will
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing her still
Because I think about her constantly
Ugh, somebody, please, if somebody can
Let them take a letter from this lonely man
All I ask is, Lord, why don't you make her
Understand because
I'll die if she don't wait for me

Oh, somebody, please, if somebody will
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing her still
I think about her constantly...
