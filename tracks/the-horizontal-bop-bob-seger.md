Wally's getting' anxious thinkin' 'bout tonight
Bruce is all spiffy lookin' wicked lookin' right
Eddie's getting' spruced
And Donna's getting' loose
Theyre passin' round the bottle
And they're gettin' good and juiced
B.G.'s winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop

Someone bring the records
Someone get the brew
Someone get a house
Buddy we'll know what to do
Someone tell the ladies
Someone make a deal
If we can't find a house
Then someone better find a field

Grass is good as carpet
Anyplace is fine
Its time to get to rockin'
Babe it's time to make it shine
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'
Dancin' till we drop
It's time to get down and do the Horizontal Bop

Theyre fillin' up the corners
Theyre fillin' up the streets
You can feel the tension
You can almost feel the heat
The music's gettin' louder
The beat's gittin' fast
Summers finally made it
Yeah its finally here at last

The pony cars are cruisin' on Woodward Avenue
Go and try to pass'em
They'll smoke you if you do
The whole town's shakin' from the bottom to the top
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'
Dancin' till we drop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop
