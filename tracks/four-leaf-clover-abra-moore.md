He's got the best of me
It's such a price to pay
He's got the best of me


See, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got this four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Yeah
(He's got the best of me) uh huh
Yeah (such a price to pay)
(He's got the best of me) uh huh


So I let go of all of the big deals
I let go of the bitter dream
You see the girl in the pretty white picture
Well it's never what it really seems
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Uh huh


My mind is always racing
And my body's on overload
You've got my heart in the middle of a feeling
I've got no place to go
Yeah
Uh huh


See, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck


I'm running
But I got nowhere to be
But I'm all right

I'm running
It's got the best of me
But it's all right


'Cause see, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Oh yeah


Said, I've been thinking it over
(Yeah)
It's all just a little too much
(Yeah)
You see I got a four leaf clover
(Yeah)
It's gotta bring a little luck
(Yeah)
Uh huh


Said, I've been thinking it over
(Yeah)
It's all just a little too much
(Yeah)
Said I've got a four leaf clover
(Yeah)
It's gotta bring a little luck
