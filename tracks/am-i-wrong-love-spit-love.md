There's too much that I keep to myself
And I turn my back on my faith
It's like glass, when we break
I wish no one in my place

And I've seen you don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep

I can't stay in this place
I can't stand
When the room turns 'round on my fate
You give no guarantees
There's no promise I can keep
I can't stand
I can't see my way, I feel blind on my feet
I can't stay too long, am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

I'm so tired of my mood
And sleep comes with a knife, fork, and a spoon
You're so pale in your face
You let life get in your way

And I've seen you don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep, am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

Ohohooh
Ohohooh
