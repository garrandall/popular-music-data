I'd like to run away from you
But if you never found me I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me
But I know I never will
You stay away and all I do
Is wonder why the hell I wait for you
But when did common sense prevail
For lovers when we knew it never will
Impossible to live with you
But I know I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you


You never treat me like you should
So what's the good of loving as I do?
Although you always laugh at love
Nothing else would be good enough for you
Impossible to live with you
But I know I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you


You make me laugh, you make me cry
You make live, you make me die for you
You make me sing, you make me sad
You make me glad, you make me mad for you
I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I want you 'til the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I want you 'til the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you, love you
But I want you 'til the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone...
