Got to be there
Be there in the mornin'


Got to be there
Be there in the mornin'
When he says hello to the world
Got to be there
Be there bringin' good times
And show him that I'm his girl
Oh what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know he loves me


'Cause when I look in his eyes I realize
I need him sharin' the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there


Be there in the mornin'
And welcomin' him into the world
And show him that I'm his girl
When he says hello world - world
(The moment, the moment I know he loves me)
He loves me


'Cause when I look in his eyes I realize
I need him sharin' the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there

Be there when the love begins
And that's everywhere he goes
I've got to be there so he knows
That when he's with me he's home
He's home

Got to be there, to be there
