I would do anything
To hold on to you
That's just about anything
Until you pull through

I'll hold on to you
Till the stars no longer wink
I'll hold on to you
Till you figure out just what to think

'Cause, you're emotion in motion
My magical potion
You're emotion in motion to me

I would go anywhere
To meet up with you
That's just about anywhere
For one rendezvous

I'll hold on to you
Until the mountains crumble flat
I'll hold on to you
Until you figure out just where you're at

'Cause you're emotion in motion
My magical potion
You're emotion in motion to me

Yeah

I would do anything
To hold on to you
That's just about anything
That you want me to

I'll hold on to you
Until you take it all in stride
I'll hold on to you
Till you want to stay here by my side

'Cause, you're emotion in motion
My magical potion
You're emotion in motion to me

Oh, you're emotion in motion
My magical potion
You're emotion in motion to me
