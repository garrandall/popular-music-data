Once I had a lion's heart, I was wild and free (sha la la-la)
I swore no girl could tame me down and make a pet of me (sha la la-la)
"I'm rough and tough, I can't be caught" I used to say
Then along came Mary and look at me today

Now I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Now I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes

Other guys all envied me before Mary's time (sha la la-la)
Nobody dreamed that I'd end up a livin' nursery rhyme (sha la la-la)
"Bring on the girls" I used to say, "I'm not impressed"
Then along came Mary and you all know the rest

Now I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Now I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes

Yeah, I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Now I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes

Yeah, now I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Yeah, I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes

Yeah, I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Now I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes

Yeah, now I'm Mary's little lamb
She leads me by the nose
Yeah, I'm Mary's little lamb
Wherever she goes, I goes
