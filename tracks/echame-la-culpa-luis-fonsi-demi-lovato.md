Hey Fonsi?

Oh no
Â¿QuÃ© pasa Demi?
Hey, yeah


You tell me that you love me
You tell me that you need me
You knew it from the start, you're not my only one
Still you wouldn't leave me

Oh, no need to say you're sorry
You know you gotta leave me
But know you gotta know
That nothing good will come if you're with me


Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
Is better if we let it be
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
{So baby put the blame on me}
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
I only wanna set you free
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
{So baby put the blame on me}


Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah

I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be

So come on, put the blame on me


Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
Is better if we let it be
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
{So baby put the blame on me}
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
I only wanna set you free
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
{So baby put the blame on me}


Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometÃ­
(So baby put the blame on me)
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometÃ­
(So baby put the blame on me)


Okay, I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
So come on, put the blame on me, yeah

I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be

So come on, put the blame on me


No eres tÃº, no eres tÃº, no eres tÃº, soy yo (soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir, es mejor olvidar y dejarlo asÃ­ (asÃ­, asÃ­, asÃ­)
{So baby put the blame on me}
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
I only wanna set you free
Not on you, not on you, not on you my love (my love)
{So baby put the blame on me}


Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometÃ­
So baby put the blame on me
Solamente te falta un beso
Solamente te falta un beso
Ese beso que siempre te prometÃ­
Baby put the blame on me
