Themes From "the Wizard Of Oz"
Themes from "The Wizard of Oz"
Meco
(Meco Monardo)
(Wicked Witch laughs, Toto barks)
Cowardly Lion:
"Rrrruf! Rrrruf!! Rrrruf!!!
Put 'em up, put 'em up!"
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find that the man is a whiz of a Wiz
If ever a Wiz there was
If ever, if ever a Wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because, because, because
Of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Wicked Witch:
(Laughs) "I'll get you my pretty!
And your little dog, too!" (laughs)
From: "David Hayman"
