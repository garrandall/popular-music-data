Oh no I can't write my name
Oh - don't you know I'm so blasted
How this revelation it is hotter
Than a matchhead
And I'm ready to go

Ready to fly away with you

And I may lose everything
But I don't give a damn if I do

Because I've never been in love
Never been in love

Never been in love

Never been in love

I've never been in love like this before

Oh - what did I miss before

Well
This good luck
It's breaking out of bounds
And I just got to tell it
Tell it
Tell it

Oh scream and shout
Well you came like a hurricane
And sent me into the clouds
Oh and I haven't seen my feet for days
'Cause I'm miles above the ground

Because I've never been in love...

Well who says I need a doctor
'Cause I'm a second-hand crazed
I've been laughing so much

Oh they want to put me away
And I'm really gonna take these chains
Of off my life 'cause this lightening I know
I would never ever strike twice
