Sweat drippin' from my body
We both at this party
So come and show me your moves
I got some things I can teach you too
If you wanna see, oh
You say you a need a shot of the Henny
Then you're ready
Do what you need to do
Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy


It's really late
You're getting close and the lights are off
Your body's in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising while I whine on you


Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove
Let's dance like we're making lo-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Ma-a-king lo-o-o-o-ove

Let's dance like we're making love

If we're down just maybe
We dance like we're making babies
As soon as our song comes on
Cause boy we got all night long
So if you ready, I'm ready
To get it, come on
I see a little faded
You wanna get crazy out on this floor
I hope you sure this is what you want
Cause once I'm turned on
You can't turn me off





Let's dance like we're making love

Of the wall
Body to body you and I
All through the night baby
Closer than before
Dance like no one's watching you and I, and I
Be the time of your life baby
