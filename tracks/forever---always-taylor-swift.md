Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something,
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore,
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect and now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flash back to when he said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes; thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Heres to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going, thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flash back to when he said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so
Ohhh ohhhh

Oh back up, baby back up, did you forget everything
Back up, baby back up, did you forget everything

It rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone and he still hasn't called
And you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flash back to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, you said forever and always

Yeah
