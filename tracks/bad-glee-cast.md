Artie:
Ah, your butt is mine
Gonna take you right, ah
Just show your face
In broad daylight, ah
I'm telling you
On how I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamone, shamone
Get on me all right...

Sebastian (with Santana):
Ah, I'm giving you
On a count of three, ah
(To show your stuff)
(Or let it be)
Ah
I'm telling you
Just to watch your mouth, ah
(I know your game)
(What you're about)
Ah

Blaine:
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true, ah
But my friends, you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get though

Santana (New Directions and The Warblers):
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
Come on, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
You know it, ah
Uh, you know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
Come on, you know

Santana with New Directions and The Warblers:
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad

Sebastian:
Ah, ah, the word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long, ah

Artie with Blaine:
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna take you right (Artie: Ah)

Artie:
So listen up

Artie with Santana:
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man (Artie: Dah)
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands (Artie: Ah)

Blaine:
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true, ah
But my friends, you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Santana (New Directions and The Warblers):
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
Come on
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
You know it
Uh, you know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really, bad)
Come on, you know

Santana with New Directions and The Warblers:
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad

Artie:
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Blaine and Sebastian:
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

Santana:
Huuuuh

Artie and Santana:
Hwoah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah!

Blaine:
Ah, we can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place, dah
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

Santana (New Directions and The Warblers):
(with Blaine: Because I'm bad), I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
Come on, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
Come on, you know
Woo! Woo! Woo!

Santana with New Directions and The Warblers:
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again

You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, woo! Ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know it, you know, ah (Bad, bad, really, really bad)

Santana with New Directions and The Warblers:
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad?
