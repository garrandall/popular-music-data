In the moonlight
In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
On the highways
In the skyways
On the byways I'll search for you

And when I find you
Just like in my dreams
I'm gonna love you
Out in the moonbeams
And even if it takes
A month or a year
I'm gonna make you
All mine my dear

In the moonlight
In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
On the highways
In the skyways
On the byways I'll search for you

I'll travel to the east
I'll travel to the west
I don't care how long it takes
I'll never take a rest
I'm not coming back
Until you're in my arms
And I can see you night and day
With all of your charms

In the moonlight
In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
On the highways
In the skyways
On the byways I'll search for you

And when I find you
Wherever you may be
I'll pick you up in my arms
And take you home with me
I'll build you a cottage
Fitted with beams
And we'll be together
Just like in my dreams

In the moonlight
In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
On the highways
In the skyways
On the byways I'll search for you
