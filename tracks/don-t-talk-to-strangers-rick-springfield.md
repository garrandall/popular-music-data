When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool

Why don't'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
And every man's an actor; every girl is pretty
I don't like what's gettin' back to me

Now, who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only one's in love
Now, did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Fais l'amour avec moi)
What's he sayin', baby?
(Viens dormir, mon amour)
I asked you not to talk to him
(Je t'aime donne moi ton cÅur se soir)
I'm begging you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don't'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers...)
