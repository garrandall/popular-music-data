Young Chop on the beat
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's gonna get

My night runs into morning, all the time
And through my phone I'm scrolling, bang my line
Off the drink is hard to focus (focus)
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno

She don't allow herself to miss nobody else
I've had days where I was DOLO
But I never caught a bad case of FOMO
Don't talk to me about your previous
You know I'm that times two
Penthouse jumpin' from the front to back room
Girls goin' wild, showin' off new tattoos

My night runs into morning, all the time
And through my phone I'm scrolling, bang my line
Off the drink is hard to focus
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno


We get aggressive (we get aggressive)
You be undressin' (you be undressin')
Making a mess and (making a mess and)
Cleaning it up when we done
I got a serious question
Do you like sex? If you thinkin' yes, then I'm tryna test you
Say I'm Khalifa, the best, but I got money to get
I gotta hop on a jet (I gotta hop on a jet)
Probably don't call, I'ma text (probably don't call, I'ma text)
Hop in my car, it get wet
I'm getting all of my checks (getting all of my checks)
I'm winning all of my bets (winning all of my bets)
No, I ain't lettin' you down, baby, I'm giving a hundred percent


My night runs into morning, all the time
And through my phone I'm scrolling, bang my line
Off the drink it's hard to focus
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you mine numero uno


I can't keep my mind off you
I can't keep my mind off you
I can't keep my mind off you


My night runs into morning, all the time
And through my phone I'm scrolling, bang my line
Off the drink is hard to focus
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
