Me-Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Please-


Hands in the soap
Have the faucet's running
And I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately, I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on


Me-Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me-Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?


What is this a joke?
You know I get this money
So I guess you can't complain (mm)
You don't have to be alone
If you bring your ass home
You been running through my mind all day
I can't fuck it up
Baby, I just want you to let up (ohh)
Maybe I been a little selfish, I should do better (yeah)
Wish you would just focus on


Me-Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby-Me
Can you focus on me?


Baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes
