Me (Me, me, me)
Can you focus on me? (Me, me)
Baby, can you focus on me? (Focus on me)
Babe


Hands in the soap (Soap)
Have the faucets running
And I keep looking at you
(Looking at you, looking at you)
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue


But I don't wanna give up (Give up, give up)
Baby, I just want you to get up (Get up, get up)
Lately, I've been a little fed up (Fed up, fed up)
Wish you would just focus on


Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?


Lazy and broke? (Broke)
No, he get this money
So I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing


But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately, I've been a little fed up (A little fed up, yeah)
Wish you would just focus on


Me
Can you focus on me? (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?


Baby, baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes, ooh
