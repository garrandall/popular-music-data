I get up, and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real


Oh can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?


Might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead, jump (Jump!)
Go ahead, jump


Hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until we begin


Well can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?


Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead, jump
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead, Jump!
Jump!

Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead, jump
Get it and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead, jump


Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
