An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances
One too many dances down the narrow street of time
Remember how we faced the world like two tramps shining
Please don't let that magic ever end
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind

No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
Call on me like you used to do
I still can show you who you are

That day the long and dusty road had us both crying
We used up our last joke just to try and smile again
And only now I find I know what we were learning
Though it's dark and you have traveled far
Every long night gives you one bright shining star

No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
Call on me like you used to do
I still can show you who you are

Deep in the night you know that you'll find
Deep in the night you know that you'll find the way

No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
Call on me like you used to do
I still can show you who you are

No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
No night so long that you can't find the day
No day so wrong that you can't find your way
