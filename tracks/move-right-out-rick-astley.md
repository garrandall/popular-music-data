She comes home in the morning light
Tries to hide the secret of last night
Tells a tale of working late
Says the things she knows I hate

Why should I convince myself
That she loves me and no one else
Feels like time to break the chains
I won't be fooled again

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out yeah

When we kiss there's no flame
But I believe I'm not to blame
When we touch its by mistake
Tenderness she just can't fake

Who does she think I am
To let her love another man
I won't take another day
I just refuse to stay

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out yeah

Oh I love her I really care
The days so long when she's not there
But I believe it just ain't right
To see her with someone else tonight

Hear me now

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out yeah
