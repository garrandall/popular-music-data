Don't you come too close to me
You're dangerous, can't you see
You can make the darkness mean more
Then it ever did
Ever did before
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the face behind the mask
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
I don't know if I want you back
You're the cool nights of the desert
And the hot kisses of the sun
Why is it that I don't belive you
When you say I'm the only one
I know I'm the lonely one
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the shadows from your past
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask
There will never be a second chance for you
Oh No
Not for you
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the face behind the mask
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
And I recognize the shadows from your past
It's a devil's disguise
Angel in black
I don't know if I want you back
I don't know if I want you back
Don't you know it'll never last
The face behind the mask
