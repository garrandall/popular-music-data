This is the heartbreak hotel 
You said that you'd be here by nine
And said you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me



Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you play with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see that you been doing wrong
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me
How could you do it to me?



This is the heartbreak hotel 
Chorus and ad lib
I ain't going to take it no more 
 Everything you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
