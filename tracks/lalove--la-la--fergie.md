(La la la la la)


Uh, tell 'em where I'm from
Finger on the pump, make the six straight jump from SoCal
Hollywood to the slums
Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where you at?
Just got to New York like a net on a jet
To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em


Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
I'ma be there in a minute
I just booked a Paris ticket
Thinking Russia need a visit
I'ma run it to the limit
And be on my way to Venice


L.A. got the people saying (la la la la la)
Brooklyn saying (la la la la la)
Hacienda saying (la la la la la)
Vegas saying (la la la la la)
Rio saying (la la la la la)
Tokyo saying (la la la la la)
Down under saying (la la la la la)
Miami saying (la la la la la)
Jamaica


Every city, every state, every country you know
All around the globe
Every city, every state, every country you know
This is how it goes


Uh, tell 'em where I'm at
From the plaques to the (uh uh)
Everything fat
Got Mustard on a track
My girls all stack
When I roll down the window, let me know where you're
Atlanta, north-south cack a lack
Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back
To London, Jamaica, then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em


Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
I'ma be there in a minute
I just booked a Paris ticket
Thinking Russia need a visit
I'ma run it to the limit
And be on my way to Venice


Get in with the business
When I come from Kansas City
Hit Manila till it's Christmas
Out to India I'll visit
Puerto Rico is exquisite
Bring my people back to Venice


L.A. got the people saying (la la la la la)
Moscow saying (la la la la la)
Espa√±a (la la la la la)
Kingston saying (la la la la la)
San Diego saying (la la la la la)

W-E-S-T S-I-DE
Where you from? I'm from west side California baby
Brought her and fucked in our backyard, the minute it ain't hard
My mama be like "YG you so brazy"
Have you ever seen a gangsta nigga make a billion dollars?
Dre did it, he from L.A. so pop yo collar
The LAPD be all over me
Tryin' to ban me from my own bity
But for no reason the cops just kill me
Home of the Rodney King riots this shit been wild
I hit the club and party like I scored a touchdown
I pop a bottle and all the models wanna fuck now
We jammin' on Pico, bustin' hoes on Sunset
I could take you to Venice Beach and watch the sun set
Or I could take you to the Blippers game, court seat, floor side
Eatin' on Roscoe's chicken wings


L.A. got the people saying (la la la la la)
Amsterdam saying (la la la la la)
Frisco saying (la la la la la)
Switzerland saying (la la la la la)
Sao Paulo saying (la la la la la)
Jo'burg saying (la la la la la)
Mexico saying (la la la la la)
Stockholm saying (la la la la la)
Jamaica
(La la la la la)


You on that Cali shit
Puff it, feel whatever
You like to like it
We legalizing it
Yes, you can join us now
We like to love it
We like to love it
We like to love it
