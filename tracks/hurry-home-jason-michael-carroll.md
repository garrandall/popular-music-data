He's been sittin' by the phone since she left
But it's time for work and he just can't be late
So he grabs his old guitar and he plays a couple bars
On the machine
Then he softly sings


It doesn't matter what you've done
I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been
You can still come home
And honey if it's you
We've got a lot of makin' up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone
So hurry home


Well the message light was blinking when he got back
It was an old friend callin' cuz he just heard the news
He said man I hope you find her if I see her I'll remind her
That her daddy's worried and wantin her to know

Well the days dragged by without a word from her
And it looked like she might not be coming back
People said man don't you think it's time to take that old message off
He said no you never know when she might call
She was just outside a bar in New York City
Her so-called friends had left her all alone
She was scared he wouldn't want her
But she dialed up that old number and let it ring
And then she heard him say


It doesn't matter what you've done
I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been
You can still come home
And honey if it's you we got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone
So hurry home
He walked in just in time to hear her say
"Dad I'm on my way"
