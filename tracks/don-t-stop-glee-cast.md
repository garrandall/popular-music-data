Don't (don't) stop (stop)!
Don't (don't) stop (stop)!


If you wake up and don't want to smile


(If it takes just a little while)


Open your eyes, and look at the day


(You'll see things in a different way)


Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop;


It'll soon be here


(It'll soon be here)


It'll be better than before


Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone


Don't (don't) stop (stop)!
Don't (don't) stop (stop)!


Why not think about times to come


(And not about how on the things that you've done?)


If your life was bad to you


Just think what tomorrow will do


Don't (don't) stop (stop), thinking about tomorrow
Don't (don't) stop (stop); it'll soon be here ( It'll soon be here)
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone


Yesterday's gone


Oh!


Oh


Don't stop no!


Don't (don't) stop (stop)!


Thinking about tomorrow


Don't (don't) stop (stop)


Oh
No, no, no


Oh! (Finn: Oh no...)


All I want is to see you smile


If it takes just a little while


I know you don't believe that it's true


I never meant any harm to you
Oh


Don't (don't) stop (stop), thinking about tomorrow
Don't (don't) stop (stop);


It'll soon be here


It'll be, better than before


Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone


Don't (don't) stop (stop) thinking about tomorrow
Don't (don't) stop (stop);


It'll soon be here


It'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone



Oh, don't you look back


Don't you look back


Don't you look, don't you look, no


Don't you look back


Yeah, yeah, yeah


Don't you look back


Oh


Don't you look back


Don't you look back


Don't you look back
Don't you look back


Oh, don't you look back


Don't, don't, don't you look back


Don't (don't) stop (stop) thinking about tomorrow
