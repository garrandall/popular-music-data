I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love


Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go


Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love


Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I, I want to rest in your light
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey, na na na ohoh
Na na na hey


I am nothing without love
I’m just these thoughts without a pen
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love


Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Watch this, come on, come on, come on, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
'Cause I am, I am nothing without love
