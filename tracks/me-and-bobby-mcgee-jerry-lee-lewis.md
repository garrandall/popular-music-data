(One two one two three four)
Well busted flat in Baton Rouge a headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Ol' Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Lord took us all the way to New Orleans
Pulled my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
Blowed it low while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands with mine
We finally sang up ever song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Lord that was good enough for me yeah good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
She was standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Looking for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding her body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Lord that was good enough for me yeah good enough for me and Bobby McGee

Yeah (la la la la...)
