Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
Caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
We don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
Baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight ohhho

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no it's never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
Baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

Naw, now I don't wanna say goodnight
We be dancing in the moonlight
Dancing with the stars tonight
Let me get this right and tell you everything I'm feeling like
You the really sweet type, not the regular mike-n-ike
Not the regular sugar high
Nobody gonna be crushing tonight
I'll be waiting standing by your window with the rose like
Ya, a I'm romeo reverse bro
Even if it's just the first date I'm on the ninth hole
But who's counting I already found a soul mate
Thinking we should celebrate, maybe even commemorate
Maybe even set a date
What am I sayin' pump the brakes
Tell me what you wanna do, all I really want is a kiss or two

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
Baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight
Just a kiss goodnight
Just a kiss goodnight
