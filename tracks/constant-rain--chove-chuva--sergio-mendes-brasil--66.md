Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chuva
Endless is the pain

As I stand here and remember
That once our hearts were one
And every day was spring to me
Till you left and took off to the sun

Now the days are lonely
The song of love is still
They say that I'll forget you
But I say I never will

And it hurts with such a pain
To be alone and lonely in the rain
And it hurts with such a pain to be
Alone and lonely in the rain

Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain

As I stand here and remember
That once our hearts were one
And every day was spring to me
Till you left and took off to the sun

Now the days are lonely
The song of love is still
They say that I'll forget you
But I say I never will

And it hurts with such a pain
To be alone and lonely in the rain
And it hurts with such a pain to be
Alone and lonely in the rain

Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
