{Intro}

Goodbye, hard life
Don't cry, would you let it ride?
Goodbye, hard life
Don't cry, would you let it ride?

{hook}

You can see the mornin', but I can see the light
Try, try, try, let it ride
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

Seems my life is not complete, I never see you smile
Try, try, try, let it ride
Baby you want the forgivin' kind, and that's just not my style
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

{Bridge}

I've been doin' things worthwhile, and you've been bookin' time
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye, would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?

Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride

Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride

Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?

{Outro}
