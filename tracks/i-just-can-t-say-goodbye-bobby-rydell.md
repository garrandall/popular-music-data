I memorized the words
I'm gonna say to you
To tell you that
I just don't love you anymore

Although my lines
Have been rehearsed so well
They slip my mind
When you walk in the door

That's when I see your face
I realize no matter how
You make me blue, oh
I just can't say goodbye to you

When I'm alone
I say I can't go on this way
A fool could see
You really love another guy

Though when I hear you say
That it's me you love
My foolish heart believes
It's not a lie

'Cause when you're in my arms
My heart forgets
All the times you've been untrue
I just can't say goodbye to you

No, I can't, no, I can't say goodbye

I just can't say goodbye to you
I just, I just can't say goodbye to you
And I said, I said I just can't
Say goodbye, goodbye to you
