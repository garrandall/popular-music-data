You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
And I just can't take my eyes off you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
To warm a lonely night
I love you, baby
Trust in me, trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay

At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
Cause you're just too good to be true
And I just can't take my eyes off you
