What good am I some like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I?
What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky you tell me
What good am I?
What good am I if I say foolish things

And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where I have been
Where have I been
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest that don't try
What good am I?
What good am I
If I watch you cry
If I said a lady
Why you slowly die
You be somebody to try
Someone to
