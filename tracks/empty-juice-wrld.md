From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

Oh, yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real
Oh, yeah, life gets tough, shit is getting real
Yeah, I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Not my real feels

Uh, devil standing here tryna make a deal, uh
It ain't no deal, feel like I'm goin' crazy but still it took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in the house on the hills, hills, hills
I didn't have vanity then and I still don't have vanity still, still, still

Bein' me, I rock PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ these drugs
Actin' like mosh pits, squishin' me, oh my
Oh me, how they kill me slowly

Lonely, I've been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I have been looking for signs
But all I can find is the sign of the times

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

I ain't suicidal
Only thing that's suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to them racks on them niggas, whoa-whoa
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of living in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission

Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos
