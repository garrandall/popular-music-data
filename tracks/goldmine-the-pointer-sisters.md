Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine

Flowers arrive, who else whould think of that but my guy
He's all heart and all mine
Oh and I don't have to be Miss Perfect One
For him to love what he sees
And I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found is every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
And oh, what he does just keeps my heart in love, woah
My baby he's a goldmine
And oh, all he does just keeps me here in love
Keeps me right here in love

Five times a day
He calls me up to say
"How you doin' babe"
He's just that way

Leaves me little notes by my coffee cup
The sweetest poetry to me
Oh and every night he tells me with his touch
The way he moves just makes me want to scream

My baby he's a goldmine
And oh, what he does just keeps my heart in love
Oh woah my baby he's a goldmine
And oh, all he does just keeps me so in love
Keeps me right here in love, right here in love

His eyes were fire when my heart was cold
My arms were ready for new love to hold
He makes me feel something that I've never known
When you find someone like him, you don't let go

Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine
Gotta love that

Oh I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found is every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
And oh, what he does just keeps my here in love, oh
My baby he's a goldmine
And oh, what he does just keeps me here, keeps me here in love

My baby he's a goldmine
He treats me kind, rain or shine
My baby he's a goldmine
Oh yeah baby, baby, baby bay oh baby
My baby he's a goldmine
Your eyes, your hands, your lips, your nose
Baby your tongue so
