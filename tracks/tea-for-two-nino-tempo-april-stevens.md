Picture you upon my knee
Tea for two and two for tea
Me for you and you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and you'll awake
Start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for
All the world to see

We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be

We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be
