Just an old-fashioned love song
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go


You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone


(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)


To weave our dreams upon and listen
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings
That we've come to know


You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on and...
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone


(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)
(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)


(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)
(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)


To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song


Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song (Just an old-fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
(Just an old-fashioned love song) Just an old song, comin' down
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)
(Just an old-fashioned love song) Just an old song
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
(Just an old-fashioned love song) Just an old song, comin' down
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)
(Just an old-fashioned love song) Just an old song
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
