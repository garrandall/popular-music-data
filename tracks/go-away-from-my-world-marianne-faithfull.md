Go away from my world
Let me dream alone
And you see it never worked from the start
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart

Go away from my world
And let me dream alone
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair
And I'll pretend you're never there

Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly

Go away from my world
And let me walk all alone
All alone in my room
All alone and so sad

I can dream of how I wanted us to be
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be

Go away from my world
