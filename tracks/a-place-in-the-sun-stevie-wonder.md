Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on


'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun


Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on


'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun


You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember


Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
