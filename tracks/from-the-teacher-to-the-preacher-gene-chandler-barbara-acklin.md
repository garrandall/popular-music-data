With Barbara Acklin
I used to carry your books
And you gave me such a sweet look
Oh, the feeling inside
The feeling I could not hide
And we went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher
We went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher together
We tied hearts together
We tied hearts
Whenever we make a date
Sweetheart, I just couldn't wait
Oh, the happy misery
And you are gonna be with me
And we went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher
We went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher together
We tied hearts together
We tied hearts
Each day, I write you a note
Saying, darling, I love you so
Those were the happy days
And I love you the same old way
Cause we went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher
We went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher together
We tied hearts together
We tied hearts
We went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher
We went from the teacher
Straight to the preacher together
