Her arms are cold but still she holds me to that vow
What once was love is now a prison wall
(Prison wall)
And though I break away to meet you anyhow
I have to say, please remember when you call

If a woman answers, hang up the phone
Don't take a chance, please, don't ask for me
If a woman answers, hang up the phone
I love you but darlin' I'm not free

These chains that bind this heart of mine may never break
But they can't stop my heart from warning you
(Warning you)
I know that I should say don't call for both our sakes
But I can't, so remember when you do

If a woman answers, hang up the phone
Dont take a chance, please, don't ask for me
If a woman answers, hang up the phone
I love you but darlin' I'm not free
I love you but darlin' I'm not free
