Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been plannin', this night
Lookin' forward to it, for some time
Now honey I know you love gettin' dressed up
And you know I love showin' you off
But watchin' your baby blue eyes
Dancin' in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is gettin' you home

Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothin'
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home

I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawin' hearts on mine
That our night out of the house
Ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is gettin' me home

Walkin' through the front door
Seein' - your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothin'
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home

Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothin'
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about, all I can think about
All I can think about Is gettin' you home
