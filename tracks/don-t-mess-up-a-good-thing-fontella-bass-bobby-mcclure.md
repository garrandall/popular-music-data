Good thing
Good thing


You been cheating on me
You know my love is true
But ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna love you like I do


Don't you be no fool
Don't you be no fool
You're gonna keep on foolin' around now baby
You gonna mess up a good thing
You gonna mess up a good thing


Now I might have cheated just a little bit baby
Like all of us do
But when I get my paycheck baby
I rush right home to you


Don't you be no fool
Don't you be no fool
You're gonna keep on foolin' around now baby
You gonna mess up a good thing
You gonna mess up a good thing


(A good thing) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(A good thing) Yeah baby
(A good thing) Oh yeah
(A good thing) Come on baby




They tell me that you got a part-time lover
Living away across town
And it ain't gonna be but a little while baby
Before you're puttin' me down


Don't you be no fool
Don't you be no fool
You're gonna keep on foolin' around now baby
You gonna mess up a good thing
You gonna mess up a good thing


Now don't you come sneakin' across town baby
To catch me doing wrong
'Cause you know everybody's jealous baby
'Cause we got a thang goin' on


Don't you be no fool
Don't you be no fool
You're gonna keep on foolin' around now baby
You gonna mess up a good thing
You gonna mess up a good thing


(A good thing)
Yeah yeah yeah
(A good thing)
Yeah baby
(A good thing)
Oh yeah
(A good thing)
No no baby
(A good thing)
Yeah yeah yeah
