Operator, operator, I'm so glad that you rang my phone
Operator, operator, I'm so glad that you found me home

I can hear my long gone lover
I've waited such a long long time
So please, operator
Put him on the line, I want him on the line
I want him on the line
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine

Operator, operator, there is static in my line
Did he say that his love was true?
Did he say that his love was mine?
Did he say he was coming home?
Did he say where he has been?
I can't hear a word he's saying
If you keep buttin' in, you keep buttin' in
You keep buttin' in
I wanna know if he's comin' home again

It shouldn't take this much time
To clear my line, to ease my mind
Oh operator, please get straight
It's unfair to make me wait any longer
My curiosity is stronger
Don't you know that it's wrong, oh so wrong

Operator, operator, this is very strange
What is the holdup here? Doesn't he have the change?
Oh please operator, if he don't have another dime
Reverse the charge to me
Put him on the line, I want him on the line
I want him on the line
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine

I didn't expect him, please connect him right way
I beg of you to put him through without delay
