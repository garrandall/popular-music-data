Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam
Oh
Oh, oh, hey


We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creeping up and down now
It's time for me to let it go


If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wilding static
Sing it, oh


Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Oh, oh, hey
We've got it goin' on for years
Oh, baby, yeah
We've got it goin' on for years


Well, I'm creeping up on your left
Straight up funky when I get with you
Keep it ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want is what you gon' get
Backstreet's got the special effects, uh


If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wilding static
Sing it, oh


Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Oh, oh, hey
We've got it goin' on for years (We've got it goin' on)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We've got it goin' on for years


We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more (Just can't hold it back no more)
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go, time for me to let it go
Jam on, jam on
Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam, oh, oh
Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam, oh


Everybody groove to the music (Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it)
(Come on now, everybody)
Everybody jam (We've got it goin' on for years)
Oh, oh
Everybody groove to the music (Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it)
(Come on now, everybody)
Everybody jam (We've got it goin' on for years)
We've got it goin' on
