I was supposed to be the rock
That you could stand on
Stronger than an old oak tree
But all you ever wanted was the one thing
I never let you see
The tender side of me
I tried to be a mountain, solid and strong
All it took was your leaving to know I was wrong
A man ain't made of stone
A man ain't made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
In this world of mine there was no room for weakness
I covered every crack in the wall
But there ain't no way that I can keep this secret
'Cause when you go like Jericho I fall
You thought I wouldn't shatter
Would I even care?
But there's more to what I'm made of
Than this broken heart can bare
A man ain't made of stone
A man ain't made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
That's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
