I don't wanna wake up
I want you spread out on the sheets
Said pussy so good
And pussy so sweet, oh
I don't wanna wake up
I want it flowin' through my streams
Gettin' me hot
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up


Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' (Yeah)
Controllin' how you moving, lucid dreamin' (Dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood (It's lit!)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (Yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah!)
Bend her over for some piping (It's lit!)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightning (Pop it)
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep (Sleep)


I don't wanna wake up (Yeah)
Want you spread out on the sheets (It's lit!)
Say, pussy so good (Pop it)
Oh, pussy so sweet (Yeah)
When I wake up (Yeah, yeah)
Want a drop top on the beach (Straight up!)
Getting me hot, yeah (Yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up


You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh!
And if I OD, I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo
And the doors goin' up, suicide


I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets
(Want you spread out on the sheets)
'Cause that pussy so good (Pussy so good), yeah
Girl, that pussy so sweet (So sweet)
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want it flowing through my streams
(Want it flowing through my streams)
Ha, getting me hot (Getting me hot)
Oh, under my feet (My feet)
I don't wanna wake up (Yeah)
