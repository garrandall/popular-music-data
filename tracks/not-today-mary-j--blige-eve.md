This is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints for the ladies

Why won't u grow up & be a man someday
I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up w/ all this child's play
Now if your word is all you have
Then u ain't worth a damn thing


Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

You're the worst
I can't even depend on u
U say a lot of good things
But something else u always do
Be a man of your word
Try to love something other than u
But now u can be on your way
Cause I don't want you to stay


Promises bout our house
Bout the kids
Lifestyle we would live
Who the fuck you really is
In my face
All the time
Spittin' line after line
Broke down my wall and you got in my mind
You's a fake shoulda known
All the signs I was shown
Believed what I saw
And your cover was blown
Breakup, leave
Make up, please
You's a magician all them tricks up your sleeve
Had me for a minute
I was in it
U played good
But I'mma get you 
Gotta get it
I'mma make moves
And I'mma leave you where you at dog, chill
Go back to square one
Wait for something real
Selfish nigga
Could have helped you nigga
Usually know betta but I felt you nigga
I guess getting in my head was a part of the plan
Cause in reality the only thing you giving me is

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

Don't let him waste your time girl
He's only telling lies girl
And when he apologizes (and he will)
Don't be believing that man
Cause he gon' do it again

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today
