Life is bringing you so down
You don't think you can make it
Every night is a show down
Every day, it's just fake it
Let me show you a new place
If you follow directions
You'll be wearing a new face
Add it to your collection
Come on

Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
When Mr. Sun goes we'll be counting on you
Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
When Mr. Sun goes we'll be counting on you

Let me show you a new place
If you follow directions
You'll be wearing a new face
Add it to your collection

And if you are interested in
What I'm trying to say to you
Look at me
Your heart will start to gain on you

Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
When Mr. Sun goes we'll be counting on you

Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
When Mr. Sun goes we'll be counting on you
Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
When Mr. Sun goes we'll be counting on you
Mr. Sun, make it fine
Shine on down for this baby of mine
Mr. Moon, come on through
Oh, we're counting on you
