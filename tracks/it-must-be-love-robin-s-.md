Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love

Somethings got me upside down
And I never been like this before
Somethings got me goin' 'in and out
And I never moved like this before

Somethings glowin' 'round my eyes
And I never looked like this before (Oh, no, no, no, no, no)
Somethings brought this girl to life
And I never felt like this before
And Im sure that was something that happened to me

Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love (Oh, listen now)

Somethings caught me by surprise
And I never opened up before
Somethings got me mystified
And I never lost my cool before

Somethings racing my heart beat
And I never lost like this before (Never, never, never)
Somethings got a hold of me
And I never (Ah) touched like this before
And I know that was never is happening to me

Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love (Oh, oh oohee, baby)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love

Ah...whoa...whoa...ah...oh.. ah...ee...

Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...yeah)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love (Oh...oh..)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love

Must be love (Oh, oh oohbaby)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love (Must be, must be)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love

Must be love (Got me upside down)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love (Got me goin' 'in and out)
Must be love (Talking about love)
It must be love (Hey, Im talkin' 'bout love), talkin' 'bout love

Must be love (Oh...oh...oh.ohohoh.oh
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love (Yeah)
Must be love (Woo...oh...oh.)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love (Im talking bout love)

Must be love (Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah...)
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love (Oh...oh...oh.ohoh)
