I want someone
To hold me, hold me (Hold me)
I've got to have that
I want someone
To caress (To caress)
Someone to confess
That she loves me
I know, I know, I know


I know there must be someone
Someone that must feel the same
And we'll lay our blames
To this love of mine


I want someone
To love (Baby, baby, baby)
That's what I need (To love me)
I've got to have it
I want someone (I want someone)
To care for, for, 
I know, I know


I know there must be someone somewhere
Someone that's got to feel the same
And we'll lay our blames
To this love of mine


I've got to have her
You know I need a girl like that
Baby baby, baby baby
My love (Who's gonna be sweet, oh, miss me so much)
(I've got to have, I've got to have)
Baby baby, baby baby (I want someone)
My love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
...
