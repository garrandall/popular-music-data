(Social Club is the best)


Haaa, put em up! haaaa

Uhh, Social Club...
We're here to ruin your day...

Yeah, I feel like a vigilante
Surviving by His grace, never had a plan B
Better fix your schedules cause you never planned me
But I'm killing everything it runs in my family
Italiano roots, beard game vicious
Mom cooks everything homemade, it's delicious (love you mommy)
I got my boys over for the three-course
Maybe four if you add that cheese course
And rappers tear you down with no remorse
But I'm busy building sand castles on the sea shore
I'm probably the worst rapper ever
She said I wasn't nothing
So, I said we're not together
Whatever, it's probably for the better
I don't believe in accidents 'cause I'm that go-getter
Alright, I'm that go-getter
Say hello to the
Bad guy misfit gang forever


 I've never been the bad boy
 You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend
 Yes, yes, yes
 the bad fiancÃ©e, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk
 Okay, the point is made


They trying to set the tone like we all suckers
And keep you gassed up till it's all mustard
Me, I got bars like the iPhone's left corner
Fern from the club
I'm a always spit the best for ya'
So much George Constanza or George Zimmerman
Signs of the time I spit about what we living in
Record deal or not, we gon' keep pushing
And y'all gon' see us at the top
Y'all gon' keep looking
Household name, but the name that we lifting up
Is above all other names
Are you listenin' bruh?
You can either stay with us or y'all can stay sleeping
Social Club Misfit Gang Boys in the trench creeping
Say, we got here overnight
How we shook the game?
Ever since we broke the top 10 it don't look the same
I'm gonna stand firm
I don't look to change
Wrapped in His love
Call and book the game
Fernie



She says she doesn't like me. No
She said that?
 Yes
 She told you, "She doesn't like me."
 Yes
 What were her exact words?
 I don't like him


Rose, they love me they love me not
But I serve em' heat hotter than summer so call me Scott
They ask me, "Why you put the rose in your name?"
So, you can see the beauty of a rose on a grave
I'm feeling like Spidey rocking the symbiote
A sheep in wolves' clothes
But some of y'all still don't get me though
The heart of a lion, I got Him in me, yo
That's why them d-boys are crying asking forgiveness
The wages of sin is death and the flesh is trying to get me stoned
Trying to prevent me from going to where I need to go
I'm at the front of the line they trying to skip me though
And I've been waiting for mines but they ain't tip me though
But God brought 'em and got 'em it's not a problem
It's Heart Official, we mobbing y'all boys wonder like Robin
I be spitting that Rose go hard rapping with a stuffy nose
But regardless the flow's cold
Hey!
