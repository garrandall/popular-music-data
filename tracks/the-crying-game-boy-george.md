I know all there is to know about the crying game
I've had my share of the crying game
First there are kisses
Then there are sighs
And then, before you know where you are
You're sayin' goodbye


One day soon, I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game
And if he knows, maybe he'll explain
Why there are heartaches (Heartaches)
Why there are tears (So sad)
Then what to do to stop feeling blue
When love disappears


I know all there is to know about the crying game
I've had my share of the crying game
First there are kisses (Kisses)
Then there are sighs (So sad)
And then, before you know where you are
You're sayin' goodbye


Don't want no more of the crying game (Don't want no more)
Don't want no more of the crying game (Don't want no more)
Don't want no more of the crying game (Don't want no more)
Don't want no more of the crying game
