We can do an album,
Or we can do a viral,
Spread it like an STD you got back in high school,
I can run for president,
Or just run the block,
I could be a stoner,
Or shit I forgot,

I could be an athlete,
I could be a New York cabbie,
I could be your boyfriend in the back seat,
Pass me a beer or a bottle of gin,
Shit! I can be your best friend,

I ain't gonna take no shit from no one,
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one,
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on,
It's golden now,
Why would I slow down?

I can do anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?

I can be your dad
Actually I probably am
I could drive a Ferrari
Or be fixing the Trans-Am
I could write bad checks
I could smoke cigarettes
I could be valedictorian having no sex

I can smell the roses
Or watch as it decomposes,
I could be one of those models shoving coke up their noses,
I could live in the streets
Or I could rot in a mansion,
I could live off the beats
Or I could die from the dancin',

I ain't gonna take no shit from no one,
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one,
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on,
It's golden now,
Why would I slow down?

I can do anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?

(Slow Down) 
Cause I can do anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
We won't ever stop
We won't ever stop
Cause I can do anything, anything, I want,

I ain't gonna take no shit from no one,
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one,
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on,
It's golden now,
Why would I slow down?

I can do anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?

I ain't gonna take no shit from no one,
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one,
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on,
It's golden now,
Why would I slow down?

I can do anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
Anything, anything, anything I want,
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
