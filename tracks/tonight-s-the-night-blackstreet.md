You know baby
(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)
I know I've been promising you everything in the world
(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)
But tonight's the night
(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)
Me and you, me and you
(Tonight's the night)

Your understanding, is what brought us this far
Never demanding, although you gave your heart
You made it easy, baby, for me to reveal
All of the love I have inside, just how I really feel

So many lovers
And yeah, I've had big fun
But none of the others took my heart
My playing days are done
Because I'm ready baby, I never been this sure
You are the one I adore
I'm gonna love you more starting tonight

Let's make tonight the night
(We make up)
Let's make tonight the night
(Baby, let's fall in love again)
Let's make tonight the night
(Tonight's, gonna be the night)
Let's make tonight the night

I have decided the moment that we met
You was invited, baby
I could never let you get away, baby
I'm so glad you're staying
Giving me all the love I need
Making me feel the heat

Boy, it's been my dream
It's been my dream
For you to love only me, yeah
Everything I want, everything I need
Can't you see it's destiny?
Oh, let's make it tonight

Let's make tonight the night
(We'll make up)
Let's make tonight the night
(In the beginning)
Let's make tonight the night
(All the deeper love, yeah)

(Let's make tonight the night)
To every little thing that I wanted, baby, baby, yeah
(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)

(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)
You're everything I want, everything I need
(Tonight's the night, tonight's the night)

Can't you see it's destiny? Oh, oh yeah
(Let's make tonight the night)
Tonight's the night, baby, tonight's the night, baby
I wanna start all over, Jazz with you, yes I do
I need your love
Please, let's make a new beginning, yeah, tonight
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night, oh yeah

Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
