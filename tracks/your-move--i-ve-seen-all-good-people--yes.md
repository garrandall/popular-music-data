I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
So satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
So satisfied I'm on my way

Take a straight and stronger course
To the corner of your life
Make the white queen run so fast
She hasn't got time to make you a wife

'Cause its time is time in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use

Move me on to any black square
Use me any time you want
Just remember that the goal
Is for us all to capture all we want
(Move me on to any black square)
Ey, yea, yea, yea

Don't surround yourself with yourself
Move on back two squares
Send that Instant Karma to me
Initial it with loving care
(Don't surround yourself)

'Cause its time is time in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use

Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Don't surround yourself with yourself)

Don't surround yourself with yourself
(Don't surround yourself)
Move on back two squares
Send that Instant Karma to me
(Send that Instant Karma to me)
Initial it with loving care
(Don't surround yourself)

'Cause its time is time in time with your time
And its news is captured
For the queen to use

Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(All we are saying)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Is give peace a chance)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(All we are saying)
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Is give peace a chance)

'Cause its time is time in time with your time
And its news is captured



I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way (yeah, yeah)
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
