So donât you worry, about a thing / Itâs gone be all right tonight



Joy comes in the morning, believe that it does / Today will rise above what yesterday was / Knowing the best is yet to come, that sees me through the day / Cause the waves of emotion are deafened by your grace / Trials & tribulations, flesh expectations / So consumed I miss the point of my whole creation / Thereâs so much around the corner that I yet to see / And I know you ainât seen the best of me / So I arise to my feet & arrive to the beat / Proceed to illuminate what my eyes donât see / Step outside my shoes where the sun donât sleep / Belief is all I have & itâs all Iâll keep/ Adjust my state of mind so I can fit my dreams/ Could the world ainât prepared for what we came to bring / Seeking the next level in this game called life / Already told you in the chorus
it will be alright.





So let me grasp your attention for the left over time like you grasping my hand knowing that its alright / Have you placed under my arm inside the fire ignites so even if Iâm afar / Iâll be the 1st on site / Coz Iâm vibing on this energy know its alright take it to another level let our minds intertwine never knowing what our interestâs may proceed to find / But for now Iâll concentrate on being on the same line / So for tonight let us raise our sights we stepping 1 after another bright colours beat moving with lights / We conversated Iâm lucky to get a insight your personal zone I think I see my invite / Letâs slow it down aint no need to rush, Take your time coz you mean so much / Just want you to know to me you mean the world glad Iâve had this opportunity to chill with you girl





Lend me your ear for a minute now / put your soul at ease / leave your dramas at the door aint no need to beef / thereâs a place we can go, it aint gotta be hostile / maybe hard to believe, but it aint impossible / close your eyes, feel the beat in you chest step / side to side let your body do the rest yes / itsâ been 17 seconds recorded and set / we half way now 39 seconds left / keep stepping extend your arms now / click your fingers and put your palms out / If your eyes still closed you can open them now / we just arrived at the place I was talking about / I see the gleem in your eyes, can sense the excitement / the look on your face as your grip starts to tighten / Ive done what I came to do Iâve taken you there / Thank you for the minute, 19 seconds to spare /
