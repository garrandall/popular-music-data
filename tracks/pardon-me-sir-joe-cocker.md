Pardon me, friend
If what Iâm saying donât seem right
But that âs the only chance I get now for being man, yeah

Pardon me, sir
If whatâs Iâm saying frays you now
But thatâs the only way to show you that Iâm a clown, oho, yeah

Iâm quite sure you understand, my baby
Iâm quite sure you understand

Pardon me, friend
If what Iâm saying donât ring true
But thatâs the only way I know now to get through to you

Well, pardon me, sir
If what Iâm doing brings you down
But thatâs the only place I know, sir, itâs time for town

Yeah, Iâm quite sure you understand, my baby
Hope you do, hope you do, let me see it right now
Iâm quite sure you understand
Iâm quite sure you understand, my baby
Iâm quite sure you understand

Yeah, pardon me, friend
If what Iâm saying donât seem right
Oooh now, but that âs the only, yeah, yes thatâs the only way now

Oh, thatâs the only, thatâs the only way
Thatâs the only, oh, thatâs the only way I know
Thatâs the only, thatâs the only way
Thatâs the only, only thing I know
