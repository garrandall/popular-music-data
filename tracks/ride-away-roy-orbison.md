There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

I was born in Texas state 
and I moved to where my mother went

I was born in Texas state 
and I moved to where my mother went

and I found my love in a happy pink glow
and I found my love in a happy pink glow

There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

There's always something going on
and there's always something happening

Ride away to a heart that's true
Ride away to a heart that's true
Ride away like Roy Orbison would
Ride away to a heart that's true
Ride away like Roy Orbison would
