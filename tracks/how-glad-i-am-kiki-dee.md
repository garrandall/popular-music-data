My love has no beginning, my love has no end
No front no back, my love won't bend
I'm in the middle, I'm lost in a spin
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love won't drop
I'm in the middle, and I can't stop
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
I wish I was a poet, so that I could express
What I, what I like to say
I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today
My love has no walls on either side
That makes my love whiter than white
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
No you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am
