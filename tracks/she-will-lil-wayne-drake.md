All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up


What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, oh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around


Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace


You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout


According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better


So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna


(miss me a little when I’m gone)


Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out


Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself


The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs


I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her
