Liberty laughing and shaking your head
Can you carry the torch that'll bring home the dead?
To the land of their fathers whose lives you have led
To the station at the edge of the town
On the southbound train going down

Equality quietly facing the fist
Are you angry and tired that your point has been missed?
Will you go in the back-room and study the list
Of the gamblers using the phone?
On the southbound train going down

Fraternity failing to fight back the tears
Will it take an eternity breaking all the fears?
And what will the passenger do when he hears
That he's already paid for the crown?
On the southbound train going down
