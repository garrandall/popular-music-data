Spring's in the air
There's magic everywhere
When you're young and in love

Life seems to be, oh baby
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just
Like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky

Dreams can come true
Oh baby, baby
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love

All you gotta do is
Trust and you'll find, baby
There's no mountain
You can't climb
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops
Are sure to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're
Young and in love, baby
Mmm, yeah, yeah

When you're young and in love

When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops
Are sure to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're
Young and in love, baby
Oh, yeah

There ain't nothing
That you can't do, baby
When you're young and in love

(Hey, hey, hey)
Impossible dreams come true
Yes, they do, baby
When you're young and in love

But many teardrops
Are sure to fall
When you're young and in love

Remember true love
Can conquer all, yeah
When you're young and in love

There ain't no mountain
That you can't climb, baby
When you're young and in love

All you got to do is
Believe and you'll find, baby...
