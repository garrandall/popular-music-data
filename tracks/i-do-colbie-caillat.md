It's always been about me, myself, and I
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time
I never wanted to be anybody's other half
I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last
That was the only way I knew 'til I met you


You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Yeah, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I can live without it, I can let it go
Ooh what did I get myself into?
You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


Tell me is it only me
Do you feel the same?
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Baby, there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through


So can we say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I won't live without it, I won't let it go
What more can I get myself into?
You make me wanna say


Meet my family, how's your family?
Ooh, can we be a family?
And when I'm eighty years old and I'm sitting next to you


And we'll remember when we said
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
No, I won't live without it, I won't let us go
Just look at what we got ourselves into
You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Love you
