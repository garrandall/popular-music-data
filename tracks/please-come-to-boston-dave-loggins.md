Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe club I hope to be workin' soon

Please come to Boston, She said no
But you come home to me
And she said

Hey ramblin' boy now you can settle down
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee

Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains, so far where we can't be found
Through I love you' echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night til ther come back around

Please come to Denver, she said no
Boy, but you come home to me
And she said

Hey ramblin' boy now you can settle down
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee

Now this drifter's world goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need somebody I can cling to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to L.A., we'll live forever
Cause California life alone is just too hard to deal
We'll live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky, livin' up on the hill

Please come to L.A., she said no
But you come home to me
And she said

Hey ramblin' boy now you can settle down
L.A ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
