Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it
Say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it
We can achieve it

Come a little bit closer baby
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night
When two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free
It's the only way to be

Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out boy
Let's work it out boy
Once again if we endeavour
Love will bring us back together
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it

Are you as good as I remember baby
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night
When two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free
It's the only way to be

Be a little bit wiser baby
Put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night
When two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
