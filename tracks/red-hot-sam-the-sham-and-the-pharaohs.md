My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot

I gotta gal that's six feet four
Sleeps in the kitchen with her head at the door, but
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot

Well she walks all night, talks all day
She's the kinda woman has to have her way, but
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot

Ow!
Whoop it, whoop it, whoop it!
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

She's the kinda woman who'll lounge-around
Spread my business all over town, but
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot

She's a one man woman that's-a what I like
Not a wishy-washy woman change her mind every night, but
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot

Yeah!

My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
My gal is red hot - your gal ain't doodley squat
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot
Well she ain't got the money, but man she's got a lot
