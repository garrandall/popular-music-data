Now what it is, what it's gon' be, no, I can't call it
All I know is I had to step up, step up
Speed it up, cut the chase, go in for first base
Before them other cats try to get ya, get ya


You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
But this time around, I doubt it shawty


Hey, how you doin'?
Baby what you gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey girl how you doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you, like you
Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body, yeah, yeah
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)


Oh, what ya drink? What you sip?
I got the next round
Martini and Goose, now
Tell me what's up, what's up
Conversation my eyes
Is havin' with your thighs
Gon' get me outta line
They better shut up, shut up


You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
You're feelin' your boy now, so I doubt it, shawty


Hey, how you doin'?
Baby what you gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey girl how you doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)
I want your body, your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body


He snubbed, you think your love was with your love
Love to get to know you better
Let's go somewhere, anywhere
I don't care, long as we can ride together
One more sip, watch your lips, we can dip
I'll slip that, tip the valet
Doors up, full halogen, yep, yep, she modelin'
I just had to say hey, hey, hey


Hey, how you doin'?
Baby what you gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leaving without you
Hey girl how you doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no


(Hey)
Hey baby what's that in your cup?
You need to let me fill that up
You know I'm tryin' to see what's up with you
(I ain't leavin' without you)
(Hey girl how you doin'?)
And I ain't thinkin 'bout your man
He shoulda had you by the hand
Cause I'm your number one fan
(Girl I ain't leavin' without you)
Hey how you doin? Hey how you doin?
