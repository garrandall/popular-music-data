Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt u
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Love if u're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when u're around
But I'll surely die
If u're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull u through
But even if I wanted 2 I couldn't really truely 'cause my only friend is u

Come on

There are thieves in the temple tonight

Kicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and u could have been a work of art
Thieves in the temple

Baby don't u know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love please help me be
The better man

Better than the thieves in the temple
In the temple tonight

Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight
Hurt me

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Thieves in the temple

U said u loved me! (Thieves in the temple)
U said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple)
U were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick)
U lie! Love come (Lie!) in a hurry (Lie!)

Thieves in the temple tonight
