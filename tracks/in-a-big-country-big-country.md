Shock

Come up screaming
Come up screaming

Ha

I never seen you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through, another season passes by you

Shock
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside

Stay alive
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered

But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming

Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted

I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered

Shock, 1, 2
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
Ha
Shock
