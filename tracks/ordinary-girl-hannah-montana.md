Don't get me wrong
I love who I am
I don't wanna be ungrateful
It probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play
The songs I sing
But with all the fame
The things that seem so simple
Are suddenly so far out of reach
Wish that they could see the underneath
I'm just an ordinary girl!

Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me

"How are you?", "Hello", "Good-bye"
One day here, one day there
And again it's time to go
Miss popular always on the road
Put my best foot forward
Gotta get on with the show

Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine
Everywhere I arrive I get high-fives
They pay me larger than life
I'm just an ordinary girl!

Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl

So give it everything or nothin' at all
Get back on your feet when you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don't you worry 'bout what people say
Who knows where the wind may blow
For an ordinary girl

I'm just an ordinary girl

Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
For an ordinary girl
Like me, like you
