Left a good job in the city
Working for The Man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
