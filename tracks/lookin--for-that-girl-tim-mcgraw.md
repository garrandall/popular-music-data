That girl, she's a party all-nighter,
A little "Funky Cold Medina," little "Strawberry Wine"-er,
That girl, she's a love gunslinger, neon jÃ¤gerbomb country-okie singer
That girl, she's a walk on the wild slide,
She's a day glow radio slow ride, low ride good time
If you see her, tell her I'mâ¦

Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round, hitting the bars,
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl

That girl she's a sugar sweet drive-by
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans, oh my
Yellowhammer, south Georgia, Mississippi chick
Drink cherry wine, Louisiana lipstick
That girl likes to drink it up real loud
Blowin' smoke in a backroad gravel cloud
Drop it down, summer heat, I've got a sittin' up high Silverado seat

Waitin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round, hitting the bars,
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl

Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby where you been?

That girl, that girl, that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl

Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find, got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Sundown, heaven town, drivin' 'round, hitting the bars,
Shooting the stars, rollin' up on every party wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Drivin' me crazy, something says baby, yeah, maybe you're that girl
That girl, that girl, that girl

Yeah, maybe you're that girl,
That girl, that girl, that girl
I've been waitin' for that girl

Hair like a field of gold
Body like a honeycomb
Smile like a country song
Baby, climb on inâ¦
