Valerie, come with me
And together, we'll build a life
You and me and we'll
Make it right forever

Valerie, yeah, stand by me
And always hand in hand
We'll do everything
We can for each other

Valerie, do do do...

Valerie, can't you see
I'd be a lonely man without you
Here to understand my problems

Valerie, do do do...

Come see how good my love can be
Girl, I need you to need me

La da da

Valerie, yeah
Let me be, let me be
Just a happy man
Give me all of the love
I can stand forever

Valerie, Valerie
