I laughed at sweethearts
I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools

A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart
Stood still

My lips could move and talk
My feet could walk and walk
And yet my heart
Stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so, well, you knew

I never lived at all
Until the thrill of
That moment when my heart
Stood still
