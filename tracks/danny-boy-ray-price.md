Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,
From glen to glen and down the mountainside.
The summer's gone and all the flow'rs are dying,
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summmer's in the meadow,
And when the valley's hushed and white with snow.
'Tis I'll be there in sunlight or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, Oh Danny boy' I love you so.
And if you come when all the flowers are dying,
And I am dead, as dead I may well be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say and 'Ave' there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be.
If you only tell me that you love me,
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me.
