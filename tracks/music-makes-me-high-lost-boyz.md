Verse 1
But I'm sayin kid
It's only right to represent where I'm from
East Coast bottom line, But I represent
Wherever I go (what)
I'll be on the West Coast
We be gettin high with the fellas
Who puff on the lie
For me, Lou, Spigg, and Tah
Everyday you know how we do (woo)
Brothers tryin to wreck the crew
We be havin mad fun
Niggas known me from day one
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Violating, they were end up nameless

Verse 2
Yo ref, ring the alarm
I know Spigg's got my back
Freaky Tah spark the charm
Give a 1,2 for my man Pretty Lou
As I bless the rest of my New York City, boo
As we continue to bring you the flav
Representin' LB
From the cradle to the grave
Now hows that, one time for your mind
But when I write down the line
I give sight to the blind, I'm
Comin thru with my click
Whattcha gonna do when shit gets thick?
Is you gonna start your runnin and hidin
Is you gonna start your slippin and slidin
Man I thought you had this game in the smash
How do it feel with real niggas in your ass
Mr. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Freaky Tah
Pretty Pretty Lou, Spiggy Spigg Nice, say

Chorus-

1 for the money
2 for the Lie
3 for my peoples in the struggle gettin by
4 Lou, Spigg Nice, and Freaky Tah
Music makes me high
1 for the money
2 for the Lie
3 for my peoples in the struggle gettin by
4 my Fam Lou, Spigg Nice, and Freaky Tah
Music makes me high

Verse 3

Mr. Sexxx, hit me off
With this drug called a track
Plug me in give me a sign to react on
Whoever, comes in my path
Make'em feel the wrath (Yeah,Yeah)
Are there, any volunteers
Down to lose their careers
Yo we feels no fears
Legal drug thugs comin thru
That's the deal
Beyond 95 LB Fam keep it real
It's hard as cleats
Walkin on the fuckin streets
Po-nine walks beats
And beats my wife Cheeks
So I gots to tally up and get it on
Get it on, word is born
Shit is on, shit is on
I must represent for my fam
Real niggas get rich and Bitch niggas scram
Till the day that I die it's L.B
From the year 95 and true 'G's

Chorus (2x)

Verse 4

To all of my, all my niggas doin Bids
To all of my shorties on their own raisin Kids
To all of my peoples who can't see
That we made it
Niggas know the deal
On the real this is rated
Hit it to the left
Who's the first one to get it to your mind and
State of shock when I hit it
Run up on niggas who be frontin and scamming
Hey Yo that's word to mine
Get that Guy's for my Fam
Nobody wants in and nobody wants out
Smokin Trees, gettin 'G's
That's what we's all about
Try to put it on for the year 9 pound
I represent my town
Show'em how I gets down
L-O-S-T to the B-O-Y-Z
Style flows on thru four families
I'm gonna stay free till the day that I die
Go with Pretty Lou, Spigg Nice, and Freaky Tah (word up)

Chorus(2x)

Verse 5 (Over Female vocals)

Hey Yo, gettin high
New York is high
East Coast you get high
West Coast you get high
Now my man named Sexxx, he be high
Charles Suitt, he be high
To my man Big Tiz he be high
Niggas on the lockdown be high

(Freaky Tai)
With niggas like this
Sweatin up in the studio
So High, Mr. Mr. Cheeks is high
Four is high
L-O-S-T-B-O-Y-Z High
Niggas best even try
Gods Day, Die
