Think--about the good things
Think--about the bad things
Think--about the right things
Think--about the wrong things
But lady before you leave me, realize that I'm the one who loves you


Think about the sacrifices that I made for you
Think about the hard times that were meant for you
Think about the good things that I've done for you
Think about the bad things I tried not to do

Come on, children, yeah



How much of all your happiness can I really claim?
How many tears have you shed for which I was to blame?
Doll, I can't remember just what it brought
I tried so hard to please you , at least that's what I thought
