Intro (Teddy Riley Of Blackstreet):
R-U-G-R-A-T-S

Chorus: Mya and Blackstreet
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, Let's go there
Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there. Let's go there
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes

Verse One: Mya
Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you bring a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life, and dreams come true


Verse Two: Chauncey Of Blackstreet
Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
Cuz you know that everything will be alright
See the magic in your eyes
Cuz the love you know
To bring your dreams to life
Where we go, Nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
I don't ever want this dream to go away

(Chorus)
Rap One: Mase
Now Lil is the one with all the exposure
Phil is the one who drop in the stroller
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
And Phil cries to sleep
Til' his eyes get bleak
I'm identical to Chucky, Chucky to petro
Chucky get scared, Chucky says "Let's Go."
If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil
Rap Two: Blinky Blink
Got one wish, Blink grant you one trip
Where we going, it's an adventure, who you wanna come with
See you my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, But it gotta be done quick
See Chucky is scared and Tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mom and dad
So take the time of day
And we'll find the place
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe
Mya: Just Take me there!
