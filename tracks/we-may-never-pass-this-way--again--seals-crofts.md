Life, so they say, is but a game 
And they let it slip away
Love, like the autumn sun
Should be dyin', but it's only just begun

Like the twilight in the road up ahead
They don't see just where we're goin'
And all the secrets in the universe

Whisper in our ears
And all the years 
Will come and go
Take us up, always up

We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again

Dreams, so they say, are for the fools
And they let 'em drift away
Peace, like the silent dove
Should be flyin', but it's only just begun

Like Columbus in the olden days
We must gather all our courage
Sail our ships out on the open sea

Cast away our fears
And all the years will come and go
Take us up, always up

We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again

So, I wanna laugh while the laughin' is easy
I wanna cry if it makes it worthwhile
I may never pass this way again
That's why I want it with you

'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm more than a friend
Like I'm the journey 
And you're the journey's end
I may never pass this way again
That's why I want it with you, baby

We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again
We may never pass this way again
