I hope tomorrow will bring a better you, better me
I know that we'll show this world we got more we could be
So you should never give up on your hopes and your dreams
You gotta get up, get out, get into it, get it on, to be strong
If we try we can fly to a whole 'nother place
All we need is belief and a smile on our face
We can go anywhere we want, any road we decide to take
And we're never, never, never too far from tomorrow today


If tomorrow is light in a place where there's none
Then now is the time to have faith in us all
You know we're all in this world and we all can belong
We gotta get up, get out, get over it, get it on, to be strong
If we try we can fly to a place in the sun
All we need is precious dreams and a friend we can trust
We can go anywhere we want, any road that we can take
And we're never too far from tomorrow today


Everybody say tomorrow is just for us to share
And we're gonna send our message of love out everywhere
There's a promise of love, tomorrow has something special
And it's something we know will last and last
'Cause we're never far away, never, one thing I can always be sure of
Far away, oh never, the promise of today




If we try we can fly to a whole another place
All we need is belief and a smile on our face
We can go anywhere we want, any road we decide to take
And we're never, never, never too far from tomorrow today


Everybody say tomorrow is just for us to share
And we're gonna send our message of love out everywhere
There's a promise of love, tomorrow has something special
And it's something we know will last and last




Everybody say tomorrow is just for us to share
And we're gonna send our message of love out everywhere
There's a promise of love, tomorrow has something special
And it's something we know will last and last
'Cause we're never far away, never, one thing I can always be sure of
Far away, no never, the promise of today
