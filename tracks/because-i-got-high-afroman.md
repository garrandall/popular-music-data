It's like, I don't care about nothing man,
Roll another blunt
Oh, good
Let me sing this song

I was gonna clean my room
Until I got high
I was gonna get up and find the broom
But then I got high
My room is still messed up and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna go to class
Before I got high
(come on yall, check it out)
I coulda cheated and I coulda passed
But I got high
I am taking it next semester and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high
(go to next, go to next, go to next one)

I was gonna go to work
But then I got high
I just got a new promotion
But I got high
Now I'm selling dope and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna go to court
Before I got high
I was gonna pay my child support
(no you ain't)
But then I got high
They took my whole paycheck and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I wasn't gonna run from the cops
But I was high
(I'm serious man)
I was gonna pull right over and stop
But I was high
Now I am a paraplegic and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna pay my car note
Until I got high
(say what, say what)
I wasn't gonna gamble on the
Boat but then I got high
(come on)
Now the tow truck is pulling away and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna make love to you
But then I got high
(help me sing, I'm serious)
I was gonna eat yo pussy too
But then I got high
Now I'm jacking off and I know why
(tryna shoot off)
'Cause I got high
(keep going)
Because I got high
(I'd do that over)
Because I got high

I messed up my entire life
Because I got high
I lost my kids and wife
Because I got high
(say what, say what, say what, say what, say what)
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk and I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I'mma stop singing this song
Because I'm high
(present tense, baby)
I'm singing this whole thing wrong
Because I'm high
(bring it back, bring it back)
And if I don't sell one copy I know why
(why man?)
'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high

Are you really... man
He really is high, man
Get jiggy with it, skibbidy bee bop diddy do wah
Bring it back, bring it back
Say what, say what

'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high

(hey where the cluck at cuz

Well my name is Afroman
And I'm from East Palmdale
(East Palmdale)
And all the tolweed I be smoking
Is bomb as hell
(excellent delivery)
I don't believe in Hitler,
That's what I said, yes
(oh my goodness)
So all of you skins (skins?)
Please give me more head
Mo'fucker

Afro-mo'fucker-man
AEIOU, AEIOU and sometimes W
We gon' sell another of these motherfucking albums
Let's go back to marshal durbin and hang some more chicken
Fuck the corporate world, bitch
