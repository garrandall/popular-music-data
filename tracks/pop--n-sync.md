Dirty pop, yo
BT


Sick and tired of hearin'
All these people talk about
What's the deal with this pop life
And when is it gonna fade out?
The thing you got to realize
What we doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of melody
We gonna bring it 'til the end
C'mon now


It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive, what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear
And where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped
And we'll do it to you every time
C'mon now


Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop (you can't stop)
And the music's all you got
C'mon now, this must be pop


Dirty pop, baby you can't stop
I know you like this dirty pop, this must be


Now, why you wanna try to classify
The type of thing that we do?
Cause we're just fine doin' what we like
Can we say the same for you?
Tired of feelin' all around me animosity
Just worry about yours cause Imma get mine
Now people can't you see


It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters
That you recognize that it's just about respect, oh
It doesn't matter
About the clothes I wear
And where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped
And we'll do it to you every time
C'mon!


Do you ever wonder why (why)
This music gets you high? (gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
(When you're body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (you can't stop)
And the music's all you got
Baby c'mon, this must be...


Oh oh man I'm tired of singin'
Dirty, dirty, dirty pop
Dirty pop
Do you ever wonder-wonder-wonder?


Oh! Do you ever wonder why
(Ever wonder why)
This music gets you high? (gets you high)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop (baby, don't stop)
And the music's all you got
C'mon now, this must be...
Do you ever wonder why
(Do you ever wonder)
This music gets you high?
(How it gets you so high, baby?)
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby, you can't stop
And the music's all you got
This must be pop, p-p-p-p-op
