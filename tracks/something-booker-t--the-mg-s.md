May some good fortune come to you
May some good fortune come to you

She's always thinking up something when I'm feeling down
She knows just what to say to pull me through
Looking like Booker T and the MGs sound
There ain't nothing my girl can't do

Not to change the subject but have you seen my shoes?
I think I left them here the last time I played
Sometimes I feel like all I ever get to do is lose
Sometimes I feel like I've got it made

May some good fortune come to you
May some good fortune come to you

People say that life is precious
And you have make to make the most of it
But nobody's proven either thing
When you stand back and you look
At the long and the short of it
What else is there to do but sing?

But may some good fortune come to you
May some good fortune come to you

You think there's a kid in this entire town
Dreaming of growing up to be a bum
I didn't think you did but we both know how
That is exactly what some will become

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Okay, maybe that's enough but getting back to me
You know my all time favorite movie is

That one where those two cops who cannot stand each other
Later under pressure, learn to work together
Become great partners even better friends
And then that one says something funny and the movie ends

And may some good fortune come to you
