I haven't had a good nights sleep in weeks .. thanks to you
There goes to broken promises you made haunts every room
A hurtin' heart can't get no rest around here
I lie awake and wonder.. how your conscience can be clear

Chorus
How do you sleep at night?
Do you toss and turn to the morning light
Does the darkness help when you lie down with the truth?
How do you sleep at night?
Are you all alone or holding someone tight?
Do you see me when you close your eyes?
How do you sleep at night?

Now your side of the beds as cold as the lies that I believed
I'm at the point where I can't even trust you in my dreams
Did the way you left me leave you feelin proud?
Or does the loneliness come calling when the sun goes down?

Repeat chorus (x2)
