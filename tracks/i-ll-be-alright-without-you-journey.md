I've been thinking about the times
You walked out on me
There were moments I'd believe, you were there
Do I miss you, or am I lying to my self again


I do these things
(It's all because of you)
I keep holding on, but I'll try
(try not to think of you)
Love don't leave me lonely
I'll be alright without you


There'll be someone else...I keep telling myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh...love's an empty face, I can't replace
(you don't need it)


People wondering why we broke apart
The great pretender here I go again
These things I do
(It's all because of you)


I'll keep holding but I'll try
(try not to think of you)
All I wanted was to hold you
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else, I keep telling myself


I'll be alright without you
Love's an empty face...Oh I've got to replace
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else, I keep telling myself


I'll be alright without you
Oh...love's an empty place, I can still see your face
I'll be alright
