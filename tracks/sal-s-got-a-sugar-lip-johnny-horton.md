'Lasses in the cane and sirup in the corn
Sugar in the gorge and honey in the horn
Cake on a plate and a pie in my pan
Come here Sally and sweeten your man

Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
To sweeten her fellar with every day

Oh, how I love that pretty little gal
Nothing on earth as sweet as my Sal
Honey on her lips and honey on her toes
Honey all over her pretty little nose

Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
To sweeten her fellar with every day

Bees are buzzin' around her door
I know what they're buzzin' for
She's as sweet as 'lasses-cane
Man alive, that's Sally Jane!

Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
To sweeten her fellar with every day

Yeah, Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
To sweeten her fellar with every day

Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
Sal's got a sugarlip, so they say
To sweeten her fellar with every day
