In the silence, I think of you
I send a message, and I hope it get's through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
All of the valley's, could take a while

I miss the people
I miss the fun
Your my apparition
She's my only one

And I imagine you standing here
It's subliminal, so inspirational
Man of the world for all the good reasons
Take away the pain and drink the wine

I miss the people
I miss the fun
Your my apparition
She's my only one

In the silence, I think of you
I send a message and I hope it get's through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
All of the valleys, could take a while

I miss the people
I miss the fun
Your my apparition
She's my only one

I miss the people
You miss the fun
Your my apparition
She's my only one
