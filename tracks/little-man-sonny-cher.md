Little man
When you stand by my side
Then I know I don't have
To hide from anyone
And I pray that
We'll stay just that way
Till the day comes along
When we catch the sun


Little girl you're runnin'
Come catch my hand I'm near you
Little girl you're singin'
Come closer to me I hear you

You're growin' old
My mother's cold
Now you've learned
What it meant to be mature
There's no such place
As make believe
But when I look at your face
I'm not so sure



You and me is what I see
And that's the way
It's gonna stay
And it will always be
So little man, please understand
In this world with all its land
You're all I see
