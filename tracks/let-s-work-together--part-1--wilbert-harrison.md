Together we will stand
Divided we'll fall
Come on now people
And let's get on the ball

And work together
Come on come on let's work together
Now now people
Say now together we will stand
Every boy girl woman and man

Before when things go wrong
As they sometimes will
When the road you travel
Well seems all uphill

Let's work together
Come on come on let's work together
Now now people
Say now together we will stand
Every boy girl woman and man

Make someone happy
Make someone smile
Let's all work together
And make life worthwhile

Let's work together
Come on come on let's work together
Now now people
Say now together we will stand
Every boy girl woman and man

Two or three minutes
Two or three hours
What do they mean
Now now in this life of ours

Let's work together
Come on come on let's work together
Now now people
Say now together we will stand
Every boy girl woman and man
