A-so long a-to you
I hope I don't make you blue
But I think I'm gonna kill myself
I think I'm gonna kill myself

Apart we've grown
And I can't go on alone
So I think I'm gonna kill myself
I think I'm gonna kill myself

Now dig my grave with a silver spade
A golden chain lay me down and down
Send my remains to my best friend
Yeah, the rest to my hole in the ground
Rest to my hole in the ground

Well I bow my head
'Cause in the mornin' I'm a-gonna be dead
Yes, I think I'm gonna kill myself
I think I'm gonna kill myself

Now dig my grave with a silver spade
A golden chain lay me down and down
Send my remains to my best friend
Yeah, the rest to my hole in the ground
Rest to my hole in the ground
