Hula hoop, hula hoop
Anyone can play from three
To a hundred and ten

From L.A. to New York
From Georgia to Duluth
Everyone is playing with
The hula hoop

Red ones and green ones
Yellow, white, and blue
Young and old, rich or poor
Are spinning them too

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing
With the hula hoop

Look at them spin
Trying to win
Anyone can play from three
To a hundred and ten

Oh, what fun to see them rock
And to see them sway
Trying to keep the hula hoop
From slipping away

If you rock when
You should sway
It would fall to the ground
Then again, once again
Spin it round and round

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing
With the hula hoop

Look at them spin
Trying to win
Anyone can play from three
To a hundred and ten

Moon and stars
Have hula hoops
Way up in the sky
?
Sailing on by

Tots and teens
And in betweens
Grandma and Grandpa too
Family fun for everyone
Spinning the hoop

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing
With the hula hoop

Look at them spin
Trying to win
Anyone can play from three
To a hundred and ten

Hula hoop, Hula hoop
Why don't you go
And roll your hoop
