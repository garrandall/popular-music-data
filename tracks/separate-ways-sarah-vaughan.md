Once our dates were oh so thrilling
Once your lips were more than willing
Side by side we passed the days
Now we're walking separate ways

Once you danced in my arms only
Now I'm watching, sad and lonely
Yes, I'm walking in a daze
Since we're going separate ways

No kiss but your kiss
Sets my heart aglow
No arms like my arms
Know I miss you so

Don't bring down the final curtain
On a love I thought was certain
If you knew how my heart prays
We'd stop walking separate ways

Don't bring down the final curtain
On a love I thought was certain
If you knew how my heart prays
We'd stop walking separate ways
