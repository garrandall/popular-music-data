(Get down!)
Niggas and bitches (Get down!)
You are now listening to... (Get down!)
The real... (Get down!)
And that would be... (Get down!)
Clipse, the Neptunes... (Get down!)
And the new label... (Get down!)
Staaaarrr Traaaak...


Top down, chrome spinnin'
You see the boss grinnin', I'm lovin' these damn women
I let two get in (Uhh...)
She tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Naw love, that's forbidden" (Get down!) I ain't for squishing
That's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them twenty's real well
Now we coastin', me, two chicks and toastin'
I turn up the volume watch the bass get 'em open
Soft-spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin' bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cuttin',
 "I was already fuckin'..."
Cinderella these girls from nothin' to somethin'
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumpin'
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the VIP, I got new moves to make (Get down!)


When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
Only if you know you live
From the club, to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)


Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be, in the back tipsy
We gets in for free ea'eday wit' me
Two steppin', you see each crew reppin'
Slippin' on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweatin'
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm totin'
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras


When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
Only if you know you live
From the club, to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)


La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(Yo, you are now listening to the sounds)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(That are vibrating your speakers)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(Please do not be alarmed)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(It will not hurt you at all)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(For it is the real)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
(For all my real...)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la
(Niggas and bitches)


When they say, "Last call," that don't mean the night's ova
That means it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, ass pushin' a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, "No sir!"
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the "Whip Appeal", or my Babyface?


The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in
She know from the beginning
She added to list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinnin' and my head spinnin'
Mine from juice and gin-in, hers from neck and chinin'
I'm a winner, man


When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
Only if you know you live
From the club, to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)
