Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted

Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess outta me
It left me caught between
Like an angry dream I was stranded, I was stranded

And I'm steady but I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take


This is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now 
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

Don't you wanna go for a ride
Down to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine
You and I why you gotta make it so hard on me

And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
And I'm running but you're getting away



Yeah, this is how a heart breaks

You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was never cared too much
For all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want
Never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew back before the time
When I was only for you



Oh yeah 
This is how a heart breaks
I can't take it
(I can't take it)
I Can't take it
(I can't take it)
Can't take it nomore
This is how a heart breaks
I can't take it
(I can't take it)
I Can't take it
(I can't take it)
Can't take it nomore
This is how a heart breaks
(I can't take it)
can't take it nomore
(I can't take it)
Can't take it nomore
This is how a heart breaks
