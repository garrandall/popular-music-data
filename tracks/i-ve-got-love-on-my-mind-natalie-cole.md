I've got love on my mind

I've got love on my mind

I've got love on my mind

And there's nothing particularly wrong

It's a feeling I feel inside

When I woke up early this morning

It was staring me straight in my eyes

I've got love (love) on my mind (oh

I've got love (love) on my mind (oh

I've got love (love) on my mind (oh

When you touch me I can't resist

And you've touched me a thousand times

When I think of your tender kiss, ah

Then and there I start to unwind, oh in your arms

I like to be, yeah, caressing you gentle

And tenderly, oh, yeah, from sunrise to sunset

All through the day, I've been waiting for your return

And you know this is where I'll be

I can say to the world I've learned only you can satisfy me

Satisfy me, oh, you have made me so very happy

Oh Baby, Baby, (love) love, love, on my (on my mind), my, my, my mind

Love (love), love, on-- (on my mind) my mind

(Love) I've got love (on my mind) on my mind, yeah

(Love) It's a whole lot of love (on my mind), it's a whole lot of love, yes, it is

(Love) I can't hear ya, say it for me one more time

(Love) Oh, I like the way you say it, when you say it for me, yeah

(Love, love) Oh, you know, it's like paradise, say it twice

(Love, love) Got a whole lot of love, whole lot of love for you, Baby, yeah

(Love) You know this thing, I got love, yeah

I've got (Love) on my mind (on my mind)

Oh (love) love, love on my mind (on my mind)

I've got, (love) I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got

(On my mind) love, love, love

(Love) I've got love on

(On my mind) my mind, yeah

Oh (love) yeah, oh, love, (on my mind)

Love, love, love, la, la...yeah
