Half of these motherfucking rappers donât know shit
Aint seen a gansta aint seen a brick
And they wonder why when the OGâs come around Yelawolf I get the respect I get
Cause I never walk into another manâs house
And tell him what I think about the way he live
I done a little dirt on my own
And I wonât throw stones
So I get back what I give
Reach for the tool homeboy go ahead
If you wanna be dead homie be dead
Who am I to be thinkin that I wonât pop a trunk
If you feelin like a punk
From the he said she said
Lifeâs not a choice itâs a win or lose
So whatâs it gonna be, him or you?
Did he lie on your bed, did she lie to your head?
Well, it all depends on the truth
See Iâm realistic and everyday canât be terrific
I done see one of my boys get ticked off and put his hands on a dirty AK and lifted it
Up in the air, and then saw him carried him
Into the club, I know he wanted to bury âem
My crew is laughing, I was scared as fuck and they thought it was hilarious


In this game it seems
That Iâm lyrically, reaching a point where
Itâs no fair no more
Hit em wit that major pain as we shoot and destroy
Itâs like Iâm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems
That Iâm lyrically, reaching a point where
Itâs not fair no more
Hit em wit that Major Pain as we shoot and destroy
Itâs like Iâm bringing war to your front door


Look how I lyrically assassinate a verse then
I can get a hook shot like urban
You never bust, rapping just like you a virgin
I know your girl, then get in her belly like a surgeon
A hundred milli gotta get it, brrrr, Birdman?
Christina Milian she ainât got her man
And I donât have no dreams either, Iâm workinâ
Surfinâ the earth and tryna stay urban
You see the heater poking out I got the shirt in
All these rappers getting jerked without the jerkins
The similes and metaphor that I be servin
Goin right over their head, hah turbans
I gotta  she a Persian
And I gotta deal with Eminem but I ainât burninâ
Hot, got a lawyer, hes really a diversion
Im ridin dirtier the 30 days with no detergent
Ainât really with the beef with the tweets, I get at you
If I ever see you in the streets Iâma slap you
I donât mean Lebron with the Heat comin at you
Cover up with the duck like Young LA tattoo
All this cake, getting flipped like a spat-u-la
Not a act, like a chat Iâm a natural
Suits tried to take me out the game
What did that do?
Still here, like a name up in here at you 
Bread cheese, yeah funds really high
Walk in the strip club throw my lunch in the sky
Front til ya die
While I spend a month in Dubai
Iâm a God in the streets, da-la-hum-dil-lee-i
Test, and Iâma bet that gonna you flunk when you try
I donât even gotta to use my gun to reply
Youâll get punched in the eye
Punched in the eye
What is a tie?
OR you can blood finna fly!


The shit Iâve seen
Has changed me
What use to be strange to me
Just ainât strange to me no more (Yeah I done seen this shit before)
Itâs just another day outside my door, outside my door
The shit Iâve seen
Has changed me
What use to be strange to me
Just ainât strange to me no more

In this game it seems
That Iâm lyrically, reaching a point where
Itâs not fair no more
Hit em wit that major pain as we shoot and destroy
Itâs just another day outside my door, outside your door


Yeah, Iâma let you take a second to introduce you to pain
Where everybody going through it and going insane
The inner struggle but they focused on making they change
Anybody get it away and they making it rain
If it go to me Iâll probably be doing the same
If I ever could Iâll forever be repping the same game
Rapping on thinking I promise Iâll get the same thing
In the back of the maybach outside of somebody name
Getting brain like I was only here to learn something
Fucking with me I guarantee Iâma return some
Raise some drama then show up tryna burn some
I do my dirt and then I never pay it back
Iâm dealing with it and never taking it
You canât respect, the city been awake
Never get attacked, got it, I cant hear nobody taking that
Wanna hit the block and wanna thug? dreaming to get away
And to the love I got for the streets, the hood
Call up any nigga who come that and try to fit in I send them away
Yelawolf go get the whip I got this
I open the gate aint no way they could stop this
They want it with us, you can tell em about this
Looking for something pretty, you can em itâs not this




Pray on my God, I believe itâs too hard
dont reach for the dogs who believe the facades
donât reach too far to compete with the dog
because deep in the heart they wanna  this all
I wish I could be the one to say I warned ya
dont pay any attention
man I wanna ignore the haters
but I canât afford to leave them alone
they say yelawolf aint never been in the dark
and trailerparks and made their mark
I gotta make it hot cause I was given a pardon
I gotta play the role
serial killing rap, cause I had a serial code
in every city with a cereal bowl
when I rap, peer in my soul
Iâm in the light like a deer in the road
clear in control, my spirit is old
Iâm hearing the Gold Iâm hearing the foes, hoes
and it falls like a rock dont mean you hard like one
you want the credit for getting gutter forget it
you muthafuckers forgot the credit card and run
street credit wonât put bullets in ya gun
but it might put a stray bullet in your son
daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and nusiance
become tangled up when it comes undone
