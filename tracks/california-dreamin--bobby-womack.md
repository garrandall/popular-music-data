All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I went for a walk
On a winters day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin
On such a winters day

Went through the church, just me
I stopped along the way
When I got down on my bended knee
And I began to pray
You know the preacher digs a call
Cos he knows I'm gunna stay
Hes knows I'm gunna stay, I told him so
California dreamin

Oh, somebody hit me know
I wanna go so bad, yeah

Cos all the leaves are brown
And the skies are gray, yeah
I went for a walk
On a winter's day, oooohhhhhhh
Id be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin
On such a winter's day
Such a winter's day
On such a winter's day, yeah, yeah, woahhh

California dreamin
California dreamin
Gotta, gotta, gotta get some sunshine
Cant believe I blew my mind
Gotta get some sunshine
California dremaing
California dremaing
Ohhh, gotta get some
California dreamin, ohhhhhh
California dreamin
Gotta get to LA
Get some sunshine every day
California dreamin
Ohh...........
