Party, funky party
Party, funky party

Uh, ah, uh, ah
Uh, ah, uh, ah

There's this place I know
Way across town, yeah, yeah
Where everyone, everyone, yeah
Specialize in getting on down

And they call it
Something like this
Party, funky party
Party, funky party

There's always a smile
On everyone's face
And when you walk
Through that door
You know, you know
You got the right place

And you hear some sound like
Uh, ah, uh, ah
Uh, ah, uh, ah

Party, funky party, yeah
Party, funky party

Party, funky party
Party, funky party
Party, we had a funky party
Party, funky party
