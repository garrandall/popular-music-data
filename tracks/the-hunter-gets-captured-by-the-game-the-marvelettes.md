Every day things change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new place

Oh yeah, secretly I've been trailin' you
Like a fox that prays on the rabbit
I had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and your habits

Oh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up, and I was in your arms
And I knew I had been captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter...
Gets captured by the game

Oh yeah!

Oh yeah, I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
But love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss, and then I knew it

Oh, my plan didn't work out like I thought
I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter...
Gets captured by the game

Oh yeah, oh yeah!
