Counting every moment
Biding all my time
Standing out here on my own
Searching for that someone
To heal this heart of mine
And keep me from being alone
But when will it be
And how will I know
I don't want to wait here forever

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

I'm waiting for somebody
To dance across the floor
Sweeping me off of my feet
I'm looking for the right one
To open up that door
And offer me a tender retreat
It's like wanting to sing
But needing a song
When will I hear the music playing?

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Somebody love me, love me
Somebody love me

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Somebody love me, love me

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Somebody love me, love me
