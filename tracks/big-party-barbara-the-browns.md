Paroles de la chanson Big Party :
Big party, big party, big party

She invited me cause she
Knew you would bring me
She make it so plain to see
She's trying to take you from me

It's a big party
But a sad party for me

I can hear her laughter
And I know what she's after
Can I make you see
She's trying to take you from me

It's a big party
But a sad party for me

So if you want her
More than you want me
Tell me now, tell me now
So I can leave

Don't ever bother taking me home
I know the way there, all alone

Oh, it's a big party (big party)

Oh, yes it is (big party)

Oh, big party (big party)
Now she turned the lights down low
And the music they playing is slow
I see the way she look at you
I see the way you look at her too

(It's a big party) oh, yes it is

(Big party) I wish I was with him

(Big party) oh, it's a big party

(Big party) whoa, yes

(Big party) oh, yes

(Big party) it's a mighty
A mighty big party

(Big party) a mighty fine party

(Big party) whoa, oh, oh

(Big party) whoa, oh, oh

(Big party) some party

(Big party) I wish I wasn't

Here tonight (big party)
