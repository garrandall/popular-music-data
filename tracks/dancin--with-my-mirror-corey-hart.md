Oh, no, no, ah

Whoa, oh, oh

It's late at night
I can't fall asleep
Shadows on the lake are obsolete
So I just stay awake
Images running round my brain

Paint your picture
You're the king of the walk
Declare your space
And prepare to shock

There is no precedence
Alone in your room
Your first offence

So I turn surprised
Reflections from behind
And I gaze to the sublime
Said na na na na na na

Dancing with my mirror
Dancing, bring me nearer to you
Dancing with my mirror
Catch it when I can, oh, no

I hear Roxanne on the radio
The red light burns
Tell me where to go
I found my decadence
Obscure but approved experience

So the truth can't be denied
Though sometimes I have tried
Ooh, the blast from the looking glass
Say na na na na na na
Dancing with my mirror
Dancing, bring me nearer to you
Dancing with my mirror
Catch it when I can

I am dancing with my mirror
Dancing, bring me nearer to you
Dancing with my mirror
Catch it when I can
Oh, no, oh, no, no, no

So I turn surprised
Reflections from behind
And then I gaze to the sublime
Said na na na na na na...

Dancing with my mirror
Dancing, bring me nearer to you
Dancing with my mirror
Catch it when I can

I am dancing with my mirror
Dancing, bring me nearer to you
Dancing with my mirror
Catch it when I can
I am dancing with my mirror

Yeah, oh, no, no, no
Late at night
I can't fall asleep
Late at night
I can't fall asleep

It's late at night
I can't fall asleep
I said no, no, no
No, no, no

(Dancing with my mirror)
(Dancing with my mirror, oh, oh)
(Dancing with my mirror)

(Dancing with my mirror)
(Dancing with my mirror, oh, oh)
(Dancing with my mirror)

(Dancing with my mirror)
