Well, this is it
That day is here
The day I knew would come
When you would leave me dear

Well, here I sit
While teardrops fall
And wonder why I care
When you don't care at all

But I'm a fool that way
From a-way back when
A fool who'd take you back
If you'd come back again

But, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me

Well, this is it
That day is here
It's no surprise and yet
I can't hold back the tears

Well, here I sit
And try to guess
How such an empty room
So full of loneliness

Well, even the clock has stopped
Somehow I guess it knew
That time's run out of me
It's over it's all through

Yes, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me...
