I'm tired of being a fool
And my mind going from hot to cool
And trying to conform to others ideas
And someone else's rules

The life I'm living ain't mine
I'm supposed to feel that's fine
I didn't make the world I'm living in
And I ain't gonna toe the line

I'm tired of trying to be something I know ain't me
I'm tired of living up to what people expect me to be
You know some people are different
Now ain't that a crying shame
Now wouldn't be a real drag if we were all the same

And I'm not going to try to please
Eyes that just don't see
If I get myself together
You'll have the blues not me

I'm tired of trying to be something I know ain't me
I'm tired of living up to what people expect me to be
You know some people are different
Now ain't that a crying shame
Now wouldn't be a real drag if we were all the same

And I'm not going to try to please
Eyes that just don't see
If I get myself together
You'll have the blues not me

You'll have the blues not me
