Wind in your hair, sun on your skin
You're looking good, girl, all over again
Hey there, Miss Brown
I want you to know I love you

Brown as the sand, you're soft as the shore
You're leaving me hungry, I'm crying for more
Oh, we, baby, girl, you're such a score
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Oh...oh...hoo...oh.ohohoh.oh.oh...oh...oh
Oh...hoo...hoo...oh...hoo...oh.ohoh

Lips soft and tender, ready to speak
Her voice says, 'I love you' {I love you} and it's making me weak
Hey there, little girl, may I just say I love you
Tell 'em how you feel, Rick

Love is the brown skin girl in my eyes
Think it's time that I told you, don't you realize
You're such a queen, woman, you're such a prize
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
And I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I love you ebony eyes, oh, my
I need you, woman
I need you (Oh...)
Oh, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I really love you (Oh...oh..), woman, I love you (Love you)
Ebony eyes (Oh...), oh, my
I wanna say that I need you (Oh...oh...oh.ohoh), honey, I need you
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ebony eyes (Woo...woo...oh...woo...hoo...)
Ebony eyes, oh, my (Hoo...)
Ebony eyes (Hoo...hoo...hoo...)
Girl, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Love you (Love you, love you)
Ebony eyes
