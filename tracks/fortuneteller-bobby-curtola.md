Fortune teller, can you see
What my future's going to be
Can you see it all
In your crystal ball
Have you got a dream for me

Fortune teller, is she free
Has she waited just for me
You can see it all
In your crystal ball
Tell me that it's meant to be

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Will we meet on a busy corner
Will she know that I'm the one
Will I be like little Jack Horner
Get myself a sugar plum

Fortune teller, will she stay
Close beside me all the way
You have seen it
All in your crystal ball
She's the only love for me

Fortune teller, is she free
Has she waited just for me
You can see it all
In your crystal ball
Tell me that it's meant to be

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Will we meet on a busy corner
Will she know that I'm the one
Will I be like little Jack Horner
Get myself a sugar plum

Fortune teller, will she stay
Close beside me all the way
You have seen it all
In your crystal ball
Gotta find a dream, you see

Whoa, oh, oh
She's the only love for me
She's the only love for me
