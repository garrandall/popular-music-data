It's there in the eyes of the children
In the faces smiling in the windows
You can come on out, come on open the doors
Brush away the tears of freedom

Now we're here, there's no turning back
We have each other
We have one voice

Hand in hand we will lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

There'll be no more hiding in shadows of fear
There'll be no more chains to hold you
The future is yours - you hold the key
And there are no walls with freedom

Now we're here, we won't go back
We are one world
We have one voice

Side by side we are not afraid
Because the train is coming to carry you home

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

Do you see the sun - it's a brand new day
Oh, the world's in your hands, now use it
What's past is past, don't turn around
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom

Now we're here, there's no turning back
You have each other
You have one voice

Hand in hand you can lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light
