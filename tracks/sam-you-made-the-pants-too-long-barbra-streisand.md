Trousers drag on, slowly drag on through the street
Yes, I'm walking, but I'm walking without feet
I'm not finding foot at all
With what's too big and what's too small
But sam, sam, you promised me both ends would meet
You made the coat and vest fit the best
You made the linen nice and strong
But sam, you made the pants too long
You made the tip lapel look so oh swell
Who am I to say that you're wrong?

But sam, you made the pants too long
They got the belt, and they got suspenders
So what can they lose?
But what good are belts, what good suspenders
When the pants are hanging over the shoes?
You feel the winter breeze up and down the knees
The belt is where the tie belongs
'cause sam, sam, sam
You made the pants too long
You know what I mean, sam?
