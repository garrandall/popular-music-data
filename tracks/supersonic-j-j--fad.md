The first guest tonight is a good friend of the show. He ah â ah, screw it


I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire


C'mon man
(Justin Timberlake! History of Rap 3!)
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear


Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind? Umm, well, of course not


De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
When it comes to being De La
It's just me, myself and...


Supersonic! (sonic, sonic, sonic)
Always rappin', always clappin', everybody always say I'm happy
If you try to hang with me you should finally truly see
I'm always rockin', never stoppin', devastatin' rappin' lady
When I'm on the microphone it's ?
Ilama llama llama llama llama
Llama llama llama llama llama, see me
Llama llama llama llama llama
Yeah, yeah
That's it
That was it, that's it
That's it


Oh my God, Becky
Look at her butt
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
When the girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face you get...


This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
If you want it
Then you've got it
If you want it
Baby, you've got it
Just bust a move


I came to get down!
(No, I came to get down!)
Then get out your seat and jump around
Jump around
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jump around
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jump around
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jump up, jump up, and get down


Drunk as hell, but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager's just blowing up
I didn't have to even use my AK


 Woah, I'm sorry, wait, um
Did you just say you didn't have to use your AK?
 I didn't, I didn't, I didn't have to use it, did I? Not today
 You don't uh, you don't have an AK, do ya, Jimmy?
 Nah, no I don't
Gotta say it was a good day


Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise


Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two time)


Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage


I'm a hustla, baby
I just want you to know
It ain't where I been
But where I'm 'bout to go (top of the world)


I'm sorry Ms Jackson, ooh!
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter to cry
I apologized a trillion times


When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it hot
When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot


Harder, better, faster, stronger
Now that that don't don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer


Can't you hear that
Boom, badoom-boom
Boom, badoom, boom
Baby got that super bass
Boom, badoom-boom
Boom, badoom, boom
Baby, you got that super bass


(Bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass, move it out now)


I live and die for hip-hop
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop
So hip-hop hooray, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hip-hop hooray, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho


I'm the king of rock
