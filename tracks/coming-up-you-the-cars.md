How could they leave you standing
Holding on to the air
With never a hope of landing
Didn't they know you cared

And you're finding out
It's never quite like it seems
You're finding out
It's never quite like it dreams

Didn't you get connected
When things were still upside down
Feeling somewhat neglected
Turning the tide around

You're finding out
It's never quite like it seems
You're finding out
It's never quite like it dreams

It keeps coming up you again
Well, you're never to hard to find
It keeps coming up you again
They're taking up all your time

It keeps coming up you
Coming up you again
It keeps coming up you
Coming up you again

However you want to take it
With streamers of violet
If only you could forsake it
It stifles your etiquette

And you're finding out
It's never quite like it seems
Well, you're finding out
It's never quite like it dreams

It keeps coming up you again
Well, you're never to hard to find
It keeps coming up you again
They're taking up all your time

It keeps coming up you
Coming up you again
It keeps coming up you
Coming up you again

It keeps coming up you again
Coming up you
Coming up you again

It keeps coming up you again
Coming up you
Coming up you again

It's coming up you
