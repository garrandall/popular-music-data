I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden
And she lives for me
She says she lives for me
Ovation, what motivation

She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile, it's like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
And I come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play

She said I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life
Baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

The sky it was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm
And a bump for the drop and then I bumped up
I took the hit that I was given then I bumped again
And then I bumped again

I said how do I get back there to
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said?

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life
Baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry

When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright
Alright

When the plane came in she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city we tripped
On the urge to feel alive but now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test

Slide up around the belly
Face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we're broken
Still it's all that I want to do just a little

I feel myself with a head made of the ground
I'm scared but I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws just locked now in smile
But nothing is all right, all right

I want something else
To get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

The sky it was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the places he gets the stars

I want something else
