If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub


Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, aye, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with G and get some money

No limit, I'm a fucking soldier, aye
Always lit, yeah, I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rocks, she act like it's a boulder, aye
'Rari, shopping, let me, cop it
Always, poppin', hella, poppin'
She's a, bopper, homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping, album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to fuck around and call Kamaiyah
Hoe stirring up the pot, jambalaya
Young Gerald


If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub


Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money


I need tongue, I need face, give me brain, concentrate
Apple phone, Prada case, kill a weave, rock a lace
Fuck the Moe, buy the Ace, fuck the Ghost, drive the Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie, fuck the Rollie, Patek face
My career takin' off, these hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth, how these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs? Bitch, I ain't Jared
If you really want some smoke, you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on SazÃ³n, I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club 'til the end from the spot
You know me, Cardi B, pussy poppin' on the charts, ah, ah!


Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, aye, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with G and get some money


Lighters up, steam out the roof (roof, roof)
Pipe up, spittin' like grill need a tooth (tooth, tooth)
Turnt-Turnt up, yeah, I need Camila in the group (group, group)
Paper up, double pumpin', big with the loot (loot, loot)
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Million cash in a safe
French vanilla by the case
Fuck the cuffs are in my brace
Frenchy is the name, CB is the gang
Let's call the boys, call a couple planes
Ring on like a mason
Pussy wet, cash long, Kyrie with the mask on
Keep a hunned, come and get some hunneds
Fuck with me and get some money
We don't make it disappear, David Copperfield
Drop top on the Ville like a lobster tail
Talk best box free like Akinyele
Talk the best bitch for a happy meal


Yeah, ayy, yeah
Fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, in Miami partying with Puffy, ayy
She want to fuck, I told her bring her buddy, ayy
Yeah, suck a- suck a dick or something
Yeah, what's understood ain't gotta be explained, ayy
Strippers at 11 keep me entertained
Money dance, money dance, just to make it rain
Yeah, third album, nothing was the same
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
A-$-A-P
I come from the bay where the Cudi say "Yee"
Touchdown in the town, I'm as big as KD
See NBA money, plant a fucking money tree
Diamonds, crystal geyser
Big body that 488's wider
Pulling up like along came a spider
The fourth time I put a baby inside her


If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance, turn this shit into a nightclub


Slob on my knob, like corn on the cob
I break a bitch, like Chyna did Rob
Put a ho to work, like she went and got a job
Everybody hit man, welcome to the mob (Mafia!)
Pull up another whip or something, yeah a different one
Fuck up another VIP or something, I been killing 'em
Smoke another zip or something, Billy Kimbered up
Take another sip or some, I ain't lit enough
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
Got them guns in my wraith
Got them ones everywhere, she got them buns in my face
I got girls on the pole, like they tryna win a race
Free that nigga Tay K, I just got another case
We get drugged up, and tear the club up
You too boring for the bitch, get your buns up
It ain't safe, it ain't safe
All these diamonds in the face
Fuck around and turn that bitch to Stevie Wonder
Yeah ho!


Fuck with B and get some money (Belly)
Fuck with B and get some money (It's me)
Fuck with B and get some money
Uh, screaming "uhhh"

Master P
Baby that ass looking like a masterpiece
Used to open doors with a half a key
Fish scale by the whale, call it catch release
No limit to it, no limit
I'm still with the go-getters and the gorillas
Old paper got me dressed up like a dope dealer
Like a wholesale of money, smellin' like a co-seller
It ain't safe (no)
Check your bags on me, I don't give a thang
Shoe box for my for my very first bank (hello)
I might pull up on your court with the tank (no limit!)


If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance, turn this shit into a nightclub


Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, ayy, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with G and get some money
