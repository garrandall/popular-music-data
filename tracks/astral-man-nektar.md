Back in town with the biggest show around
Strike up with the band
It's time for Astral Man
Don't know where he'll be landing
From his tightrope in the sky
Don't know if he will make it.

Close your eyes
Watch him fly
Astral Man
Turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
Returning together down to earth
Oh oh oh yeh oh, oh oh yeh, oh oh oh yeh
Down to earth

Astral Man how gracefully he lands
Thrills all 'round
His antics know no bounds.
Don't know what he'll be doing
On his his tightrope in the sky
He thrills the little children

Close your eyes
Watch him fly
Astral Man
Turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
Returning together down to earth
Oh oh oh yeh oh, oh oh yeh, oh oh oh yeh
Down to earth

Astral Man acknowledges the band
People clap
They appreciate his his act.
He bows towards the people
And leaves the ring behind
Hoping he has given
Money's worth
Watch him fly
Astral Man
Turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
Returning together down to earth
Oh oh oh yeh oh, oh oh yeh, oh oh oh yeh
Down to earth

Thank you Astral man!
