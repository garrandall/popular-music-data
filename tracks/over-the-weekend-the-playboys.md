Think it over, over the weekend
Don't be so quick to say that we're through
Those rumours that you heard
Believe me, were absurd
There never was no one but you

While thinking over the weekend
Remember how we thrilled to each kiss
Go home and close your eyes
And you'll see through their lies
Then you'll never end it like this

Why you'd be so wrong
If you said so long
Without an investigation

I know that you care
And you'll judge me fair
And give my love it's due consideration

In the meanwhile over the weekend
I'll pray your verdict isn't goodbye
If you let jealousy take you away from me
Over the weekend, I'll die

Why you'd be so wrong
If you said so long
Without an investigation

I know that you care
And you'll judge me fair
And give my love it's due consideration

In the meanwhile over the weekend
I'll pray your verdict isn't goodbye
If you let jealousy take you away from me
Over the weekend, I'll die
Over the weekend, I'll die
