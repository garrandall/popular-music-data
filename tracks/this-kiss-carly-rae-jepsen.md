I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention (Your attention)
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)


And you...
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end


This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
(This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)


You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession (My confession)
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension? (Feel the tension)


And you...
I'm dancin' to where you are
And you're dancin' to where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end


This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss


But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
I shouldn't, I shouldn't
I don't wanna miss this kiss


This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental (Sentimental)
You make so detrimental (Detrimental)
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss


I wish it didn't feel like this
I don't wanna miss this kiss
