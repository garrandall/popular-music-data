Jam Up and Jelly Tight
My, my, my, my, baby, now you're outta sight
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You look a little naughty but you're so polite
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You won't say you will, but there's a chance that you might
I said; the first day I met you
Someday, I'm gonna pet you
Now you're here and baby I love it
So come on and give me some lovin'
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
My, my, my, my, baby, now you're outta sight
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You look a little naughty but you're so polite
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You won't say you will, but there's a chance that you might
You've got a sweet disposition
So come on and give me permission
For one kiss and maybe another
You'll see we were meant for each other
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
My, my, my, my, baby, now you're outta sight
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You look a little naughty but you're so polite
Jam Up and Jelly Tight, yeah
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
(Written by Tommy Roe & Freddy Weller)
(Reached #8 in the USA in late 1969 & early 1970
