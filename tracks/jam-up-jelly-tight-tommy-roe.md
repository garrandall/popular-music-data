Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite
Jam up and jelly tight
You won't say you will but
There's a chance that you might

I said the first day I met you
Someday I'm gonna pet you
Now you're here and baby I love it
So come on and give me some lovin'

Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite
Jam up and jelly tight
You won't say you will but
There's a chance that you might

You've got a sweet disposition
So come on and give me permission
For one kiss and maybe another
We'll see if we're meant for each other

Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite

Jam up and jelly tight
Jam up and jelly tight
Jam up and jelly tight
Jam up and jelly tight...
