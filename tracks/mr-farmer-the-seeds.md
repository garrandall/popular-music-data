See the farmer on the other side of town
He's always workin' hard 'til the sun goes down
He's up every mornin' right on five
A-wanting green seeds just to come alive

But he don't wear a-no farm clothes
He's always using a rake and hoe
But his seeds are starting to grow
Like a big stalk through the sky

He used to live in an apartment in a big old city
With thick and priestly windows built right in
But he decided to move to a little tiny town
He wanted to be a farmer all year 'round

And on a country road where you can't see a thing
He's got five acres filled with little green things
He said he's working so hard
All night and day

Mr. Farmer, let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me harvest your crops
I want to have a dream come true
I said farmer, farmer, farmer
I want to be just like you
Just like you

See the farmer a-walking downtown
Always draws a crowd when he's around
He's always wearin' a-seedy clothes
He shows them off wherever he goes

A-you can spot him anywhere
He got a bright pink thumb, but he don't care
I said, he looks like something from a very bad dream

Mr. Farmer, let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me harvest your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me save your crops

I said farmer, farmer
Farmer, farmer
