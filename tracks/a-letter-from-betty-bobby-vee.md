I got a letter from the mailman yesterday
It came from Betty and was postmarked far away
I felt so good until I looked inside
I read that letter and I cried

She said, dear, Bobby
Just a line to say hello
We've been such good friends
You should be the first to know

I fell in love
My dreams have all come true
And, Bobby, he's so much like you

He swept me off my feet
I'd never thought I'd meet
Someone else who'd be so good to me

I know someday you'll find
Someone to love you true
You'll fall in love and then
You'll feel just like I do

So long for now
Write me soon, goodbye
I read that letter and I cried

I love her so
But now she'll never know
My golden chance has passed me by

I waited much too long
Now he's come along
This letter from Betty means goodbye

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
This letter from Betty means goodbye
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
This letter from Betty means goodbye
