They come from the cities and they come from the smaller towns
Beat up cars with guitars and drummers going crack, boom, bam


R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., yeah, yeah
Rocking in the U.S.A


Well, they said goodbye to their families, said goodbye to their friends
With pipe dreams in their heads and very little money in their hands
Some are black and some are white
They ain't too proud to sleep on your floor tonight
With the blind faith of Jesus, you know that they just might
Rocking in the U.S.A
Hey


Voices from nowhere and voices from the larger town
Filled our head full of dreams and turned our world upside down
And there was Frankie Lymon, Bobby Fuller, Mitch Ryder
(They were rocking)
Jackie Wilson, Shangri-las, Young Rascals
(They were rocking)
Spotlight on Martha Reeves, let's don't forget James Brown


Rocking in the U.S.A
Hey
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
