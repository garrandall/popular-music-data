I walked away and I left you cold

Now I wanna come back to you
Oh, yes, I do, I know
I know I was wrong
But deep down in my soul
But now I wanna come back to you

Oh, oh, oh, coming
Oh, yes, I'm coming back to you
Oh, yes, I'm coming back to you
Darling, I'm coming
Oh, I wanna come back to you

Oh, oh, I want your forgiving
Oh, your forgiving arms of love
Cause darling, I wanna
Come back to you

You know sometimes
A love will go astray
(Sometimes a love will go astray)

But now I wanna
Come back to you, darling
(And now I'm coming back to you)

And although I've done you wrong
I believe I learned my lesson by now
(I learned my lesson) yes and I had to
Learn it the hardest way (hardest way)

And if you'll forgive me, darling
And give me one more chance
If I have to get down on my knees
And crawl back to you
I wanna come back home to to you now

Oh, oh, oh, coming
Oh, yes, I'm coming back to you
Oh, yes, I'm coming home to you
Darling, I'm coming
Oh, I coming back to you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, your arms for the love
Oh, darling, I wanna come back
I've got to come back to you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Coming back to you
Oh, yes, I'm coming back...
