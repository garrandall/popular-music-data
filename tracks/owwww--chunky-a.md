I've had many Girlies
In my life and time
Light
Dark
Short
Tall
Women of all kind
Sister named Velda
Snow named Gidget
I even got busy
With a cute little midget
Nothing made my heart sing
Nothing seemed to last
The future looked dim
Just like the past
But surprise from the sky
Came a dream called you
No one's ever rocked me
Like the way that you do
It hurts so good
When you do what you do
You're the end of the line
I wanna spend my life with you
Whitney Houston
Madonna
And even Brooke Shields
Don't come close to you
The real deal
You're erotic
Exotic
A chocolate ton of fun
Every woman I need
All wrapped up in one
More cushion for the pushin'
I hope I can hang
Let's spread cake on yo' body
And we'll do the wild thang
