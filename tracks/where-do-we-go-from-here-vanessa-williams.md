Life can be strange, somethings we forget
Or rearrange in time, lose the past
Tell me the truth, tell me how can I know
That this new love of ours, that it's gonna last

I need your strength and I feel your worth
With you I feel protected from all harm

Where do we go from here it's clear
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
Where do we go from here I know
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

What's in a name, his life just a game
We color then erase (we've been erased), when we lose face
How many lives, tell me how many tries
Before we get it right (before we get it right), the truth is inside

I need your strength and I feel your worth
With you I feel protected from all harm

Where do we go from here it's clear
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
Where do we go from here I know
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

When I never weak, so weak
To scared to speak
When I never low, so low
To tell me, you will never need

Where do we go from here it's clear
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
Where do we go from here I know
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

No matter what the road, your love will lead me home
