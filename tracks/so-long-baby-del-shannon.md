I see you're laughing and 
A-telling everyone in town
That you've made a fool of me
Well go ahead and talk some more
'cause, baby, I don't care no more
You don't bother me at all

'cause I got news for you:
I was untrue too
And I don't care what you say
So go and laugh some more
'cause baby I don't care no more
I got another lover of my own

Step by step you put me down
Always calling me a clown
If you ever go away
Promise that you'll stay
Far, far, far away from me

Now that we played our game
I guess we're both to blame
We tried to break each other's hearts
You had one jump on me
But I jumped twice, you see
It's over now, be on your way

So long, baby, be on your way
I had a ball, you thought I'd fall
You had one jump on me
But I jumped twice, you see
It's over now, be on your way

So long, baby, be on your way
So long, baby, be on your way
So long, baby, be on your way
