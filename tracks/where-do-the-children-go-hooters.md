Surrender into the night 
Silently take my hand 
Nobody knows what's inside us 
Nobody understands 
They handed us down a dream 
To live in this lonely town 
But nobody hears the music 
Only the echo of a hollow sound 

Where do the children go 
Between the bright night and the darkest day 
Where do the children go 
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away 

Together we make our way 
Passengers on a train 
Whisper a secret forever 
Promises in the rain 
We're leaving it all behind 
While castles are falling down 
We're going where no one can find us 
And if there's a heaven 
We'll find it somehow 

Where do the children go 
Between the bright night and the darkest day 
Where do the children go 
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away
