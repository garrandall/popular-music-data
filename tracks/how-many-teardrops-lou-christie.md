How many teardrops must I cry till you believe in me?
& how many teardrops must I dry to end this misery?

I wanna know: how many teardrops must I cry yi yi yi yi
Must I cry, have to fall
To say you're mine (you're mine) only mine (you're mine)
Mi yi yi yi yi yine

I wish I knew the reason why you've gone & made me blue
You didn't even tell me that you & I were through
I wanna know: how many teardrops must I cry
Must I cry, have to fall
To say you're mine (you're mine) only mine

It's all a part of a little game that you had cooked up for me
Tryin' to find out just how much you really mean to me
If that's the reason for leavin', there's no reason to explain
'Cause baby, I really need you like the roses need the rain

I wanna know: how many teardrops must I cry yi yi yi yi
Must I cry, have to fall
To say you're mine (how many teardops)
Oh must I cry (how many teardrops)
Oh must I cry (how many teardrops)
