So I got my boots on, got the right 'mount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
And I'm workin' my strut but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line 'tween the dark side
And the light side, baby, tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete

If I had you
Life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you
Y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA getting high rock 'n' rollin
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls, in stripper heels, boys, rollin' in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love

There's a thin line 'tween a wild time
And a flat line, baby, tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete

If I had you
Life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you (You)
Y-y-y-y-you
If I had

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I've got you stuck on my mind, yeah
The flashing on the stage
It might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete

If I had you
Life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
You, y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you
You, y-y-y-y-you

If I had you
That would be the only thing I ever need
Yeah, if I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete
(Never could compete with you)

If I had you
Life would be a party it'd be ecstasy (Be ecstasy with you)
Yeah, if I had you
You, y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you
You, y-y-y-y-you
If I had you
