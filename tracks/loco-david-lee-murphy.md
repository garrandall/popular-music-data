Little Hula girls on the shot glass.
All we need's a little salt and lime.
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend,
That we're livin' on Key West time.
I can run to the store and get some charcoal,
Buy a tikki torch and fire up the grill.
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up,
But you know I never will.

Yeah, I might be a little bit loco,
But it keeps me from losin' my mind.
Oh, but half insane, that's ok, babe,
A little bit crazy's all right.

There's nothin' wrong with a little excitement;
No, it makes me forget about work.
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool,
Just as long as nobody gets hurt.
Hey, I feel like I'm on vacation.
Honey, you say the word and we'll go.
'Cause you're getting to me in those cut off jeans,
And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joe's.

Yeah, I might be a little bit loco,
But it keeps me from losin' my mind.
Oh, but half insane, that's ok, babe,
A little bit crazy's all right.

Yeah, the deep end might be so close,
Oh, that I'm hangin' on for dear life.
Yeah, I might be a little bit loco, baby,
But a little bit crazy's all right.
That's right.

Yeah, I might be a little bit loco,
But it keeps me from losin' my mind.
Oh, but half insane, that's ok, babe,
A little bit crazy's all right.

Yeah, the deep end might be so close,
Oh, that I'm hangin' on for dear life.
Yeah, I might be a little bit loco, baby,
But a little bit crazy's all right.

Yeah, I might be a little bit loco,
But it keeps me from losin' my mind.
Well, I might be a little bit loco, baby,
But, a little bit crazy's all right.
You're crazy, baby.

Might be a little bit loco, baby,
But, a little bit crazy's all right.
