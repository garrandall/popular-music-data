You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down


Girl, you're like an elevator cuz you always pick me up
Girl, you're like a doctor, when I'm sick, you always stitch me up
You could be my DJ, I'm your record, come and mix me up
You can be my lollipop, let me, let me lick you up
On the Bottom, on the top, baby, let me flip you up
You could be my soda pop, Coca Cola, sip it up
Whipped cream, whip it up, strip, unzip it up
I could be your chip, you my dip, let me dip it up


You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down


Boy, you're like an elevator 'cause you always pick me up
Boy, you're like my doctor, when I'm sick, you always stitch me up
You could be my DJ, I'm your record, come and mix me up
Boy, just be my lollipop, let me, let me lick you up
Always on my membrane, I love you so I give it up
Let's visit all the places that's exquisite, let's go live it up
Walking down lover's lane, flying in aeroplane
Boy, you get me higher like your n-n-ame was Mary Jane


You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down


Fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You me pick up when I fall... down
When I'm down
You pick up, up off the ground
When I'm down, down, down, down, down
