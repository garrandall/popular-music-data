What your mother don't know 
She won't mind 
Her good advice was a waste of time 
You wanna live fast 
Cutting it fine 
Make hay while the sun shines 

No one there to say you're wrong or right 
You've waited a lifetime 
Burning all your bridges tonight 

This is the wild life 
It's the wild life 
Wild life 
This is the wild life 
No stone left unturned 
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned 
You might lose your way 
When you come out to play 
The wild life 

I may be too young 
But I've seen and done 
Everything that they say is fun 
I gotta find out for myself 
In the end there's no one else 

Every time I try to win I lose 
I'm tired of waiting 
Now I'm gonna make my own rules 

This is the wild life 
It's the wild life 
Wild life 
This is the wild life 
No stone left unturned 
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned 
You might lose your way 
When you come out to play 
The wild life 

No one there to say you're wrong or right 
You've waited a lifetime 
Burning all your bridges tonight 

This is the wild life 
It's the wild life 
Wild life 
This is the wild life 
No stone left unturned 
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned 
You might lose your way 
When you come out to play 
The wild life
