My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
But my love will not
My love is a rock
Headed out into uncharted waters
What you feel is your only guide
And each step that you take brings you closer
Just trust what you feel inside
Cause something's telling you to keep on going
Telling you that your aim is true
Could be the voice of reason, or just blind devotion
Whatever it is, it's calling out to you, singing...



Mixed messages shoot through a wire
Tender turmoil in your voice
Change is spreading through you like a fire
Bridges are burning, you made your choice
And as you're searching for peace in your world
You may find yourself spinning around, and around, and around
While the pain you've endured
Only serves to make you surer
Of the strength you have found, and then...



You may not be looking for love, but love may find you
You may choose to close your eyes and run
You may leave love far behind you
In your eyes I can see the future
In your heart I can always trust
In your mind I will live on forever
In your arms I will turn to dust
These are feelings like I have never known
The song of my very soul
I can no longer silently sing it
I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing...

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here
With any tick of the clock
Life can change it's course
Some things are here and then gone before you know
Some things disappear without a chance to grow
But my love will not
My love is a rock
