Sweet baby, our sex has meaning (Sex has meaning)
Know this time you'll stay 'til the morning (Stay 'til the morning)
Duvet days and vanilla ice cream (Vanilla ice cream)
More than just one night together exclusively (Exclusively)


Baby, let me be your man
So I can love you (I can love you)
And if you let me be your man
Then I'll take care of you, you


For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of ours


We're drinkin' the finest label (Finest label)
Dirty dancing on top of the table (Top of the table)
Long walks on the beach in April (Beach in April)
Yeah, I promise, darling, that I'll be faithful (Be faithful)


Baby, let me be your man (Let me be your man)
So I can love you (I can love you)
And if you let me be your man (Let me be your man)
Then I'll take care of you (I can love you)


For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of ours


Give me your body and let me love you like I do
Come a little closer and let me do those things to you
This feelin' will last forever, baby, that's the truth
Let me be your man so I can love you


Baby, let me be your man (Let me be your man)
So I can love you (I can love you)
And if you let me be your man (Let me be your man)
Then I'll take care of you (I can love you)


For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)
For the rest of yours (For the rest of yours)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)
For the rest of yours (For the rest of yours)
For the rest of ours (For the rest of ours)
