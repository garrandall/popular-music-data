You got your hair down
I got this top back
Kissing on my neck
Girl, you got to stop that
Do you want that fast lane?
Or do you want that back seat?
Girl, you got to pick one
You can't expect me
To keep my hands to myself


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses


She's got a wild side
Bet trouble's in her blood
Thinks I'm an outlaw
That's double trouble son
She likes to rock hard
She likes to kiss soft
Hot as a barrel on a 12-gauge sawed off
Ain't hard to please, long as you got speed


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah


Yeah, she's dancing with the devil
In the cold November Rain
When she's Knocking On Heaven's Door, son
You can bet God'll call her name


She ain't into wine and dining
She's shooting whiskey singing Sweet Child of Mine, man
Riding '95 sitting shot gun pretty
Turning this town into paradise city
Running wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yes My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yes
My baby's Guns N' Roses
