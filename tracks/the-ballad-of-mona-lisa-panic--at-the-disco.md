She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to
Assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a
Taste of what you paid for


Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe


Whoa, Mona Lisa, you're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa, I'd pay to see you frown


He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him


Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe


Whoa, Mona Lisa, you're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa, I'd pay to see you frown


Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out


Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe


Whoa, Mona Lisa, you're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa, I'd pay to see you frown


Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe


There's nothing wrong with just a
Taste of what you paid for...
