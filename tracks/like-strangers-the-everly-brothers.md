Like strangers
That's what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far?
Like strangers
How can it be?
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly

I love you, truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too

Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers, anymore

Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers, anymore
