Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

Wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on old Rocky Top
Half bear, the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as that soda pop
I still dream about that

Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

I've had years of cramped-up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again

Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That why all the folks that live on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
