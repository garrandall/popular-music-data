High on love

You say you'd never try it
'Cause it's, oh, so wrong
You say you can resist it
'Cause you're, oh, so strong

But once you've had that feeling
You'll be comin' back for more
'Cause you'll like the pleasure
Of bein' high on love

You think that lovin' someone's
Not the proper thing to do
But, girl, you've never had
The kind of love I'll give to you

So if I should kiss you
Oh girl, don't be ashamed
'Cause you'll like the pleasure of
Bein' high on love

Let me take you to a world
You've never known before
So much love is waitin' there
Just open up the door

Once you've been there, baby
You'll come runnin' back for more
'Cause you'll like the pleasure of
Bein' high on love

Once you've been there, baby
You will stay forever more
'Cause you'll like the pleasure of
Bein' high on love, on love, on love
On love, on love, on love
