Yeah, ha
Three years ago, I wrote a song "I Still Remember"
I don't know why y'all pretending
I guess everyone forgot
I put it on the table, was the only thing I ate
Them green beans changed my life and I ain't even use a pot
That was back when ain't nobody listen
But I told them every single thing I would do and now they acting shocked
Now the labels want to come and buy me
Try to sign me
Everybody want to check me out, but now I'm out of stock
Started chasing women they was gaining my attention
Only saw me as the color green
So I had to stop
Birds of a feather
Thot together if they ever talking negative about me
They was never in my flock
Made relationships with people who knew I was lethal
We were tightly bonded way before my dreads were ever locked
Got a small circle, that's a round to keep me grounded
Keep it honest with me even if I make it to the top
Phone on the charger
While I'm watching Law and Order
Got me thinking 'bout this current situation with the cops
Another trending topic of discussion
Real discussions sick of all these loopholes
Lord knows I hate Crocs
Big Dawg told me if I ever have a problem
Not to doubt him, just to let him know and he gon' hit the spot
If it all goes down then we have to make the swap
I understand if he gonna take the charge like a Static Shock
Don't fall for the panty lines
Flesh is never satisfied
Every wise thing I know I got it from my pops
If you make it to your dream
And you're making money clean
You either rap or play sports if your hair look like a mop
Strings get pulled
But at least your stomach full
If your last name Johnson
You better know how to rock
And if you don't know how to roll
Then rap about getting stoned
And if you over six feet
You can shoot it like a Glock like

Stop!
Think fast
Get cash
Don't react, just laugh
Pop, champagne and rubber bands
Don't complain and get mad
Just be smart, first class
Stunt in they face, mustache
Wait, and shake they hand
Smile, and do your lil' dance

Shut up and let's get this money
You always crying about something
Why is you bugging
I know this food is disgusting
But not out in public
You better act right at this luncheon
(No no don't say nothing)
Just pretend the jokes are funny
Like hahaha hahahaha hahaha

Coolin' Kaepernickin' with my knickerbockers
We ain't talking proper, we just kickin' it, and I ain't talking soccer
I don't believe in logic, 'cause balling ain't a problem
Know they dread to see me on the team, and now I'm on the roster
In the fourth quarter, I can guarantee a dollar even if it comes to pennies, ain't nobody Proud as Oscar
If everyone's against me, I'm gon act like Jameis Winston in the kitchen
That's no disrespect to Marcus Mariota
I'ma toss that thang, new whip, yeah I bought that thang
Skrrrt skrrrt, yeah, I cross that lane
I don't know what I'm wearing, but I'm as sharp as a fang
The stylist wasn't using slang when he said "Balmain"
Get money, yeah, I bought that chain, but am I free though?
Or am I just distracted by making all of these fritos?
One's a lonely number til' you start making zeroes
Am I another copy that's getting this paper like Kinkos?
Did I forget my message like texting, no we delete those
Did he just beat the women like Teken, oh, we don't see those
I know he raped that girl, but does he really need prison?
He's a really fine swimmer, in three months, he'll be free though
While others get locked up without a peephole
If it ain't about race, then why ain't jail time equal?
What does it have to do with Jesus? Man, I can't believe those
Who have the nerve to say that Obama should've been vetoed
I have a question, maybe I could ask the mayor
I just want an honest answer, doesn't even have to be fair
I know I shouldn't be scared, but why police officers have a higher shot percentage than some NBA players?
But then I say no problem just gon' stay in the house
Then I think about Chris Brown and how that thing played out
It's funny cause I thought that it was just in the South
I guess gettin rich don't make black go outta style like

Stop!
Think fast
Get cash
Don't react, just laugh
Pop, champagne and rubber bands
Don't complain and get mad
Just be smart, first class
Stunt in they face, mustache
Wait, and shake they hand
Smile, and do your lil' dance

Shut up and let's get this money
You always crying about something
Why is you bugging
I know this food is disgusting
But not out in public
You better act right at this luncheon
(No no don't say nothing)
Just pretend the jokes are funny
Like hahaha hahahaha hahaha

Shut up and let's get this money

Like hahaha hahahaha hahaha

I love the thing you do with your time
When you don't say nothing
(No no don't say nothing)

Shut up and let's get this money
You always crying about something
Why is you bugging
I know this food is disgusting
But not out in public
You better act right at this luncheon
