Hoo...hoo...

A sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
I call you cotton candy
You're my cotton candy

I've got a sweet tooth
That's hard to satisfy
When I'm short on sugar
You've got a full supply (Full supply)

Girl, don't be stingy
Gimme, gimme some
Girl, I can't live forever
On a diet of your love

(Cotton candy)
You are my (Cotton candy)
Sweeter than apple pie, oh(Cotton candy)
You came straight from Mother Nature's oven
Bringin' me that red hot lovin'

Shooby doo wop
Lyrics courtesy Top40db
Shooby doo wop
Shooby doo wop
Shooby doo wop shoo bop bop shoo bop

Girl, when I'm near you
I'm like a honey bee
You know I want your honey
But you keep on teasin' me (Don't you tease me, girl)

Girl, don't make me suffer
I'm starvin' for your love
You give me just a little
But woo, it's just not enough (Just not enough), oh

(Cotton candy)
I can't get enough, get enough of your (Cotton candy)
Woo, sweeter than apple pie, baby (Cotton candy)
All the recipes are good, I know
But next to yours they don't come close

I've tried apples, peaches, pumpkin pie
They're all right
But when I kiss my baby
I lick my fingers, smack my lips
Do you know her I call these things

'Cause she's a sweet
Oh, so sweet
I call you cotton candy
Baby, you're my cotton candy
Sweeter than apple pie, baby (Cotton candy)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough of your sugar (Cotton candy)
Sweeter than apple pie, woo, baby (Cotton candy)
I can't get enough (Cotton candy)
Of your sweet, sweet, sweet cotton candy
