Some of the old gang
We still keep in touch
Relive the memories
We cherish so much
Sit there and laugh
At all the things I did
When I was a kid

Seems only yesterday
The sixties were here
Hot Summer nights
With a six-pack of beer
When I burned up the road
In my Coup Deville
I was the king of the hill

I still love James Dean,
Elvis and rock 'n roll
Haven't out grown my wild ways
I'm a grown up kid
Feelin' just like I did
In my younger days

My friends, they tell me
I'm a picture of youth
While they're show me their age
In a moment of truth
Though my rock 'n' roll living
Seems crazy to some
The music's keeping me young

I still love James Dean,
Elvis and rock 'n roll
Haven't outgrown my wild ways
I'm a grown up kid
Feelin' just like I did
In my younger days

There's a child in my heart
That I'll never let go
Dreamin' of something
That I'll never outgrow

'Cause the music still move
And the memories we made
Are getting better with age

I still love James Dean,
Elvis and rock 'n roll
Haven't outgrown my wild ways
I'm a grown up kid
Doin' just what I did
In my younger days

I'm a grown up kid
Doin' just what I did
In my younger days
