I heard about it raining on a Georgia night
Never saw clearly in the morning light
I was walkin', just walkin' in the rain

She was a rainy day woman
She made me love her
Took my soul and I soon discovered
I was searchin', searchin' for rainbows

Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
One time or another
Stormy weather

Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart

So play me a song
Just for a feeling
Cause it's the only thing
That keeps you warm
When your memories get too cloudy to see

So rain me back home

Oh, I was walkin', just walkin' in the rain

She was a rainy day woman
She made me love her
Took my soul and I soon discovered
I was searchin', searchin' for rainbows

Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
One time or another
Stormy weather

Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart

Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
One time or another
Stormy weather

Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart
