Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday, I saw your smilin' face
Love walked through, my door
One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever


Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you


I felt the sun
Shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm
Through the darkest night
I found my brightest star
One magic moment
Made one magic night
I fell in love
With one look in your eyes baby
I never knew I could feel so loved
Darling, in your arms
I could feel forever


One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms babe
Where I found forever and ever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night (last night I cried)
Heaven shined a light (Heaven shined a light)
All my dreams came true
Cried my first tears of joy, last night (cried, tears, shined)
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
