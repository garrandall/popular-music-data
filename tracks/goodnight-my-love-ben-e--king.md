Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
There's just one thing
I'd like to know
Is your love still warm for me
Or has it grown cold

If you should awake
In the still of night
Please have no fear

For I'll be there
Oh, you know I care
Please give your love to me, dear

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight
My love (sleep tight)
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Close your eyes, my love
(Goodnight)
Sleep and dream of me
My love, my love, my love

My love, oh, my love
(Goodnight)
