One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was really meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, standing by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down

One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
...
