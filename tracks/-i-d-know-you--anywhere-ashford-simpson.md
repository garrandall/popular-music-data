There may be other hands
But they're just imitation
Cause they can't and never will
Make Me feel the same vibration
And there may be another voice
That may sound just as sweet
Could there be another pair of arms
To make Me feel so complete

I'd know You anywhere

Said I would know You
Anywhere You go
Said I would know You
Anywhere You go

Said I would know You, babe
Anywhere You go
I'd know You, baby, anywhere You go
You don't know how long it's been
You couldn't fool Me
No matter where or when I would know You

A thousand hands may touch Me with their eyes closed
Oh, baby, I'd know You by the tenderness
I would know You by the sweet, sweet tenderness
A thousand voices may call My name out loud in a crowd
But I'd know You by the melody that flows from You

Repeat Chorus

Change the world if You want to
I'd know You, baby, I'd know You

A thousand hands may touch Me with their eyes closed
Oh, baby, I'd know You by the tenderness
I would know You by the sweet, sweet tenderness
A thousand voices may call My name out loud in a crowd
But I'd know You by the melody that flows from You

Repeat Chorus
