Close!
As close as any lovers can be
When I feel your magic holding me
You make the love inside me flow
Baby (Baby) There's just something that I want you to know

That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be

Oh-oh it's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
A way you keep me coming back for more
When you making easy love to me

Touch!
Your touch can make me feel so high
With you the night just seems to fly
You take my every breath away
Oh-Oh-oh, Baby.(Baby)oh what more than is there to say
To say...

That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be

Oh-oh it's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
The way you keep me coming back for more
When you making easy love to me

That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be

That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be

Oh! Oh! It's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
The way you keep me coming back for more
When you make easy love to me
