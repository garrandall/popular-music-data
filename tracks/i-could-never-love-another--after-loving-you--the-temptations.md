Girl, I can't believe my ears.
Are you really telling my goodbye?
See, you've taken away my reason for livin'
And you won't even tell me why.
Before you walk out the door
There's something I want you to know.

That I could never, ever love another, after loving you.
Ooo-hoo
No other love will I share 'cause none could compare
After loving you.

It was only yesterday.
Your words are still fresh in my mind.
Baby, you said,
Long as rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more.
Now you wanna leave me behind.
Listen baby, I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay.
I just know I've got to find a way.

'Cause I could never, never, never ever love another, after loving you.
Ooo-hoo
No other love will I share 'cause none, none could compare
After loving you.

So baby, please stay beside me.
I need your sweet love to guide me.
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooo, after loving you.

(I could never love another, after loving you)

Baby, baby, baby
It was only, only, only, only yesterday.
Your words are still fresh in my mind.
I remember you said,
Long as rivers flow.
Each day you'd love me more.
Now you wanna leave, leave me behind.
Listen baby, I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay.
I just know I've got to find a way.

'Cause I could never...
Never, never, never, ever love another, after loving you.
Ooo-hoo
No other love will I share 'cause none, none could compare
After loving you.

Ooo, baby.
On my bended knees
I'm begging you to stay here with me.
Oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby

I could never, never, never, never love another, after loving you.
Ooo-hoo
No other love will I share 'cause none could compare
After loving you.
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
(Never love another, after loving you)
