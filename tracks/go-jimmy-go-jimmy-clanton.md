I told her when it comes to talking
I'm the sweetest sweet-talker in the world
She said you better start talking if you want me to be your girl


And she said, "Go, Jimmy, go." She said, "Go, Jimmy, go."
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, "Go, Jimmy, go."


I told when it comes to dancing
I'm the best young dancer in the land
Well, she looked at me with a twinkle in her eyes
And then she took my hand


And she said, "Go, Jimmy, go." She said, "Go, Jimmy, go."
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, "Go, Jimmy, go."
And she said, "Go, Jimmy, go." She said, "Go, Jimmy, go."
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, "Go, Jimmy, go."


I told her when it comes to kissing
I ain't nothing but a kissing fool
She started to giggle when I told her that I'd teach her
Things she'd never learn in school


And she said, "Go, Jimmy, go." She said, "Go, Jimmy, go."
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, "Go, Jimmy, go." "Go
Jimmy, go." "Go, Jimmy, go
