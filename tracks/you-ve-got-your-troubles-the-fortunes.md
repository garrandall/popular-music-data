I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place;
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away
Now just like you I sit and wonder why;
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago
That we were walking, and we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away
And so forgive me if I seem unkind
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
(Counter: And it must seem to you, my friend
That I ain't got no pity for you
Well, that ain't true
You see I lost my lost my lost my little girl too

I'd help another place, another time
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
