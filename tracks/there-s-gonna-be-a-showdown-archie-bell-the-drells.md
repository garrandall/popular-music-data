Say man, they tell me you think you're pretty good
Don't you know you're in my neighborhood
They tell me you're pretty fast on your feet
So I want you to meet me at the dance hall
On Market Street, you hear
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdownj, showdown, oh yeah

I've got ten notches on my shoes
When it comes to dancin
I just can't lose
They call me the top cat in this man's town
So I want you to meet me before the sun goes down
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah

All the girls are losin faith in me
Don't seem like top cat's great
As he used to be
I know I'm good
So you better be better
When you get out on the floor
You better have your steps together
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah

Now my reputation has been one of the fastest men alive
So I'm gonna see how good you are when I count to five
(One) oh man, you better stop
(Two) You can do better than that
(Three) Man will you move aside
(Four-Five) And let me get out here and do my jive
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah
