It's all in her eyes, you and me, words just disguise
All the things that you be
What is deep, it's deeper than sea
So only it knows, this kind of vibe gets stronger in time

Won't go on unnoticed, so concrete can't hold this
Hearts filled righteously
Whatever it is, I know that it's real
Long as you know, no complaints, you're all that I feel

(Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista
(Sista soul)
Hey sis, you must be my soul sista, soul sista
(Sista soul)
Hey sis, you must be my soul sista
(Sista soul)

You are so fine, like spaces that fall in my soul
See baby that has no rhyme
Do you like how it feels when I smoke you out head down to your toes?
Making you, making you scream and shout

You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you're my
(Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you're my
(Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you're my
(Sista soul)

You must be my soul sista, soul sista
(Sista soul)
(Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, sista, sista, sista soul
(Sista soul)

Sista soul, sista soul, sista soul
Can I love you in the right way? Please
Soul, hold, baby I want to love
You know baby I want to love in the right way
Hold 'cause you're my soul sista, baby you are my
All I wanna do is love you in the right way

Hold, on 'cause baby, you're my soul sista
So love you in the right way, you are my
You're my soul sista, you're my
Soul sista

You're my soul sista, soul, you're my soul sista, hey, yeah, yeah
I want to love you in the right way
Hold, don't you know what I say
Hold, baby don't you know, you're my soul sista, hey
