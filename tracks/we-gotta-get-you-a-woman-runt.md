DJ Khaled, we're the best, nigga we're the best man
Woo we nikka (listen)


Just got a hundred of that brown paper bag money
You niggas really wanna talk money?
Shit real that's all I could tell 'em
Just rap 'em up good so the dogs can't smell 'em c'mon

Brown paper bag (thank god for that)
Brown paper bag (yo Khaled I'm so focused homie I can see clearly now you all ready know what it is)

Thank god for those days, thank god for those nights
Though it might seem wrong thank god for that white
They use to call me the pirex kid, aka young arm and hammer
In the kitchen with the pots yeah work the glass
Hard on 'em pimp yeah I work the task
And when they came in we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unrapped 'em all
Just two words nigga duffelbags I just know it so well
I can't help but brag, old man got 10 mail man got 3
And just your luck the rap game got me hold up


Here we go again just spent a hundred of that brown paper
Bag money all on timbs, and that bad bitch is all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine I'm so far in I'm speaking with an accent
Just cartwin, can't even relax in my room,
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my niggas getting brown paper bag money
This for my strippers getting black plastic bag money
We're talking that bad money, that I.R.S can't tax money you dig me


Just made a hundred of that brown paper bag money
I thank god for the meal he prepared for me
Taking my fam and my little dog money
Thank god for that brown paper bag that

Brown paper bag (thank god for that)
Brown paper bag (c'mon)
Brown paper bag (thank god for that)
Brown paper bag (we the best)

Just pulled over in my 7-5
Big bottle on the dash, hope he let me slide
Got 20 in the trunk you can bet me 5
20 minutes in they dump I'm gonna let these slide
We're the best
Look at what we drive got picnic tables on my lap getting high
In the back of that maybac and it cost five hundred thou
When the nigga, spent then with a smile
Stacking numbers that alarm and race
White house still moving bricks alarm today
I'm that bin lading boy I'll bomb the state
I ain't come to stay I gotta post bond today
2 million in the bag, I ain't wanna brag
you don't know the feeling when the villain peeling in the jag
Just staring at the ceiling 10 women that you had
I was at the center now I see you feeling just a (fag?)


Just spent a 100 of that brown paper bag money
It feel good to be young money cash money
Rehab I'm addicted to fast money
I got stacks and rubber bands up in that

Brown paper bag (you're dig)
Brown paper bag (my name is weezy you all)
Brown paper bag (I'm here on behalf of young money cash money)
Brown paper bag (I represent 17 road of New Orleans let's go)

Practice makes perfect I'm relaxing at rehearsal
I'm gonna motherfucking professional like Hershal Walker,
the talk of the game is I, but I wonder if he'll still be talking after I die
But that's not important
Money's more important
And understand I been in that water like I was snorkeling
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami Khaled took me in like a orphan
Why did they start him?
Now they can't park him
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent
Lamborghini dark tint
Philly blunts cigar scent
I'm by myself and niggas run they mouths like auctions
To streets my brother
Fefe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
you heard what I said motherfucker did I studder
With my brown paper bag, here to represent the hustle I'm out


Coka baby man you know I already had money
Definition of that brown paper bag money
Try and front as if you in the jag money
For the cash I'll blast anybody that

Brown paper bag (that that that that)
Brown paper bag (thank god for that)
Brown paper bag (coka baby cribs mania)
Brown paper bag (we are simply the BEST the VERY BEST)

You all niggas want coka music
The costra nostra flow show you how to do this
Pen it so easy, a caveman can do it
Nigga we simply the best don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet but give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of rap rushmore
Etched in stone runt top puns war
Unsure anythings possible
4mil spent bought out the art possible, I'm Picasso in the Versace suit, don't worry my nigga
Khaled I got you, not just 'cause I want to 'cause I got to, put the squad on your back did the impossible
It's only logical I spit from the heart, brown paper bag who else for Joe 2 guard that

BROWN PAPER BAG
BROWN PAPER BAG
