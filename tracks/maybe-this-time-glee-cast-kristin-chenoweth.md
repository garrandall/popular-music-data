Maybe this time
I'll be lucky
Maybe this time
He'll stay
Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away

He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time
And the time before


Everybody loves a winner


So nobody loved me
Lady peaceful, lady happy
That's what I long to be
All of the odds are
They're in my favor


Something's bound to begin


It's gotta happen


Happen sometime


Maybe this time I'll win


Cuz
Everybody they love a winner


So nobody loved me


Lady peaceful, lady happy


That's what I long to be
All of the odds are
They're in my favor


Something's bound to begin


It's gotta happen


Happen sometime


Maybe this time I'll win
Maybe this time I'll win


Win!
