Yeah
Sex game had her ass blowing me up (brrr)
Sex game had her ass texting me up
Yeah (808 Mafia!)
Whoa


I got the moves
I got the moves
I'm making moves
You gotta move (you gotta move)
She make that back move (damn)
She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (like whoa)
I make the city move
I got the moves (I'm making-)
I got the moves (I got the moves)
I'm making moves (I'm making moves)
You gotta move (you gotta-)
She make that back move (damn)
She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (l do)
I make the city move (I do)


Look, give me the ball and I won't have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility, look
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away


I got the moves
I got the moves (whoa)
I'm making moves
You gotta move (you gotta move)
She make that back move (damn)
She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (like whoa)
I make the city move
I got the moves (I'm making-)
I got the moves (I got the moves)
I'm making moves (I'm making moves)
You gotta move (you gotta-)
She make that back move (damn)
She made her titties move (goddamn)
I make the city move (I do)
I make the city move (yeah I do)


Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)
I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my Mom
Me and my girl been through so much, that's my partner in crime  (808 Mafia!)
Touch any of the above, now you harder to find
Gone
