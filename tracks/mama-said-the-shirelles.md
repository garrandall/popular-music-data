Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)

I went walking the other day
Everything was going fine
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
And then I almost lost my mind

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this

There'll be days like this my mama said
My eyes are wide open, but all that I can see is
Chapel bells are callin' for everyone but a me
But I don't worry 'cause

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this

There'll be days like this my mama said
And then she said someone will look at me
Like I'm looking at you one day, then I might find
I don't want it any old way, so I don't worry 'cause

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this

There'll be days like this my mama said
Mama said, mama said
Hey, don't you worry
Mama said, mama said

Hey, don't you worry now
Mama said, mama said
Hey, hey
