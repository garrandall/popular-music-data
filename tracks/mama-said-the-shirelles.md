Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

I went walkin' the other day, yeah
Everything was goin' fine
And then I met a little boy named Billy-Joe
And then I almost lost my mind

Come on, mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Oh, mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

My eyes were wide open
All that I could see, yeah
The chapel bells were tollin' 
For everybody but me
But I don't worry 'cause

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

And then she said
Someone would look at me 
Like I'm lookin' at you
One day
Then I might find 
I don't want you any old way

So, don't worry, 'cause
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
Oh, yeah
(Mama said, mama said)
Don't worry, yeah, don't worry, now, yeah, eah, eah, eah
Don't worry, worry, now, now, now
Don't you worry
