Am I really hard to please ?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me
My friends all fall so easily

But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so ?
'Cause the feeling was so unexpected
I could hardly keep myself collected

I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
Never did believe in lovin' on sight
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
All I know is now it's gotta be right

In the midst of conversation he looked into my eyes
And all through the conversation
Much to my own surprise
Half the words he said to me were missin'
'Cause my mind was so intend on kissin'

I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
Never did believe in lovin' on sight
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
All I know is now it's gotta be right

Am I really hard to please ?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me
My friends all fall so easily
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so ?
And the feelin' was so deep inside me
I could feel it when he brushed beside me

I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
Never did believe in lovin' on sight
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
All I know is now it's gotta be right
