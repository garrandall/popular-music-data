Happy, make you happy, baby

I just wanna make you happy
Make you happy, baby

Ain't no mountain too cloudy skies
When trouble pressing depression should make you cry
I will show you a better side
Where there's a rainbow shining just for your eyes
Happy, gonna make you happy, baby

Don't be sad and blue, happy's come for you
I will take your frown, turn it up side down
Every, every little care I'll chug away some where
If a tear should fall down your pretty face
It will be from happy
Let me make you happy, baby

For your smile I'll be a clown
I'll go get my laugh bags and my funny shoes
Bring your heart and sit right down
There is nothing I won't do just to make you happy
I just wanna make you happy, baby

I'm so close I feel your sorrow too
When I'm see you cry, my eyes won't stay dry, oh...
Baby can't you see, I just wanna be
I wanna be your happy
I wanna make you happy, baby

I want, want you in my arms be your blanket keep you safe and warm
I want to be your guiding light
Let me lead you down the path of light

Happy baby, baby...
I won't let them take your smile away

Don't be sad and blue, happy's come for you
I will take your frown, turn it up side down
Every, every little care I'll chug away some where
If a tear should fall down your pretty face
I'm so close I feel your sorrow too
When I'm see you cry, my eyes won't stay dry, oh...
Baby can't you see, I just wanna be
I wanna be your happy...
