Feels good
What you gon' do? Do you wanna get down?
What you gon' do? Do you wanna get down?
Welcome to Fantasy Island


Music and sexin' go together like a hand in glove
Making love on the dance floor with my clothes on
I need to feel the rhythm of your body here next to mine
So baby can we break it down
If you think that you can take me down


Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough
Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough


You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
You need it, you're feenin
Every day and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
And you need to call Adina tonight


Don't think I'm trippin'
I just wanna have fun
I got my Vodka and my Henn
I'm 'bout to find me one
Scoping while I'm toking, feeling good tonight
Good and fired up 'cause I'm doing way too much


Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough
Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough


You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
You need it, you're feenin'
Every day and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
And you need to call Adina tonight
Oh, you're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
You need it, you're feenin'
Every day and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
And you need to call Adina tonight


What you gonna do?
Do you wanna go down?
What you gonna do?
Do you wanna go down?
What you gonna do?
Do you wanna go down?
What you gonna do?
Do wanna go down?


Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough
Do you wanna come party?
Do you wanna get up?
Just-a move your body
'Til you can't get enough


You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
You need it, you're feenin
Everyday and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
And you need to call Adina tonight
Oh, you're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
You need it, you're feenin'
Every day and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You wanted to show it
And you need to call Adina tonight


What you wanna do? Say you wanna get up
Do you wanna get down?
Down, down, down, di-di-di-down
Lady Love is here
Get your groove on, every day...
