I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
But all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want when it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth


I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you


You're the hope that moves me
To courage again, oh yeah
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far


I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you
Oh, yes I do, oh
I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms and it carries me through
I need you


Oh, yes I do
I need you
I need you, oh
I need you
