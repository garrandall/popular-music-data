The real me is a Southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
The real me used to laugh all night
Lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately, I've been jaded, life got so complicated


I start thinking about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels like
With you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Now that I'm with you


You speak and it's like a song
And just like that, all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me


'Cause I start thinking about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know when love feels like
'Cause with you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you, with you, with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh


Come and take me
Love you, save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you


I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now (Baby, as I do now)
Now that I'm with you (Now that I'm with you)
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy (Crazy)
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
