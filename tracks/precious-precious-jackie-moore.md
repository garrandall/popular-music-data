Precious, precious
Precious, precious
Precious baby, you're mine
Mmm... if you don't love me, I'm used to that

If you don't need me, baby, I can adjust to that
If you don't want me, honey, that's alright
If you ain't willin', baby, there sure won't be no fight
'Cause I'm still satisfied

In loving you
And I'll be waiting 'round when you get through
Oh, you're precious, honey
You're so precious

Precious baby, you're mine
You've been in and out of my life
And, ooh, baby that hurts
Baby, that hurts, yeah

You've been with every girl in this town
You've been dealin' in dirt
Just wallowin' in dirt, yes you have
But I look at love as a two-way street

You get the good with the bad
You take the bitter with the sweet
Oh, you're precious, honey
You're so precious, baby

Precious baby, you're mine
Oooh-oooh, na, na, na, na, yeah, baby
Oooh-oooh, na, na, na, na, yeah, baby
Mmm... what people say about ya

Sure ain't no fun
But what they don't know about ya
You're like two men wrapped up in one
We've got our life, so let's make it

It's our chance, so come on, baby, let's take it
Oh, you're precious, baby
You're so precious (precious)
Precious baby, you're mine

Yes, honey (precious)
You're precious, baby
Precious baby, you're mine
Ooh, you're precious, baby, yeah (precious)

You're so precious, yes, you are (precious)
Precious baby, you're mine
Oooh, you're precious, honey (precious)
Oooh, you're precious, baby (precious)

Precious baby, you're mine
