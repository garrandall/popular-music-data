I heard some talk around this town
Talk about you and me
How a fool fell out of love with you
Wanted to be free

Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
And left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say

I read your letter again
I'm sure you know the one
"Goodbye," you said like a coward
"It'll be better in the long run"

Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say

Go back to her again
Back to the way you were
She's a damn sight better for you
You're a damn sight better for her

Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
When you've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say
