Down and out and underneath the bottom
Of the bottom of the life I lead
Here and there and anywhere
With anyone, with someone who
Will give me everything I need

I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me

Sink or swim, I'm putting in
The middle of an ocean
Middle of the sea
This or that is where I'm at
And I've a notion come tomorrow
Yesterday is where I'll be

I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me

Time hangs heavy each day
Ticking away, going so slow
Why when love is a gas
Doesn't it last, where does it go

I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me

Down and out and underneath the bottom
Of the bottom of the life that I lead
Here and there and anywhere
With anyone, with someone who will give me
Someone who'll give everything I need

I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me
I'm into looking for someone to love me...
