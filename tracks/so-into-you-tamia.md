With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
Every time that I'm near you
I realize that you're heaven sent

I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy
There's no one like you around
Oh, baby

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you


It could be the way that you hold me
It could be the things that you say
Oh, I'm not too sure what it is boy
But I know I like feeling this way

I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy
There's no one like you around
Oh, baby

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you


Oh I really like
What I feel when I'm with you
You're a dream come true
Don't you ever leave my side
'Cause it feels so right

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
