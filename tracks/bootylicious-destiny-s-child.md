Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this


Better move, cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
Baddest chick, chick inside
DJ, jam tonight
Spotted me, a tender thang
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna dance with me?
Can you handle, handle me?


You gotta do much better
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff


I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe


Baby can you handle this?
Baby can you handle this?
Baby can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this


I'm about to break you off
H-town goin' hard, read my hips
Slap my thighs, swing my hair
Squint my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Over my shoulder I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?


I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe


Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground
I can't help but wonder why
My vibe's too vibealacious for you babe


I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz


Pa pa de do da-de
Pa pa de do da-de do
Pa de-de oh
Pa de-de oh
Pow pow pow pow


I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya jazz
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya baby
