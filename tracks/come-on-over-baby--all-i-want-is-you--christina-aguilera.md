Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby (here we go)
Come on over, come on over baby (that's right)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on over, come on over baby


Hey, boy, don't you know
I've got something going on (ah, yeah, come on, come on)
I've got an invitation, don't you keep me waiting all night long
I know, you know
So baby, don't
Pretend you won't, keep me guessing if you
You will or you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you baby
Listen to me...


All I want is you (come over here baby)
All I want is you (you know you make me go crazy)
All I want is you
Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
Cause all I want is you


Come on over (that's right), come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby


I'm not just talking about your sexuality (your sexuality)
But I can't help myself, when you put your hands on me
(When you put your hands on me)
Oh, oh
It's paradise (it's paradise), when you and I
Get close, get tight
One on one I wanna, go all, all night
I wanna play that game with you baby
Listen to me...


All I want is you (come over here baby)
All I want is you (you know you make me go crazy, so crazy)
All I want is you
Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
Cause all I want is you


Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over


Don't you wanna be the one tonight
We could do exactly what you like
Don't you wanna be just you and me?
We could do what comes so naturally
I got a thing for you
Got my mind made up (yeah)
And I'm serious, never been more, baby
I'm sure that it's real (so sure)
And it's right here, uh, come on


Come on, come on, come on, over
Come on, come on, come on, over
Come on, come on, come on, over
Come on, come on, come on, over
Come on, come on, come on, over
Come on, come on, come on, over


You give me...
What a girl feels, what a girl likes
What a girl needs, what a girl wants
All I, all I want is you
Oh baby


All I want is you (oh, you make me go crazy, oh, oh, woo)
All I want is you
Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
All I want is you


Ohh, oh, yeah
All I want is you, you make me go crazy, you
All I want is you
Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
