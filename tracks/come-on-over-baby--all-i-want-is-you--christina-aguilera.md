C'mon over, c'mon over, baby. 

Hey, boy, don't you know
I've got something going on (Yes, I do)
All my friends are gonna come gonna party all night long
I know, you know, I just want us to go
The fun we'll have fun you'll never be alone
So boy, won't you come?
We will party till the dawn. Listen to me...

All I want is you (Come over here baby)
All I want is you (You make me go crazy)
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy (You better cross the line)
I'm gonna love you right (All I want is you!)

C'mon over, c'mon over, baby. 

I want you to know you could be the one for me (Yes, you could)
You've got all I'm looking for
You've got personality
I know, you know, I'm gonna give more
But boy you know, I never felt this way before
So, boy won't you come? won't you come
And open the door? listen to me.

All I want is you (Come over here baby)
All I want is you (You make me go crazy)
All I want is you (now baby dont be shy)
you better cross the line 
im gunna love you right. (all I want is you!)

now baby dont be shy, you better cross the line,
im gunna love you right! oh baby

All I want is you (Come over here baby)
All I want is you (You make me go crazy)
All I want is you (now baby dont be shy)
you better cross the line
im gunna love you right 
coz all I want is you!
