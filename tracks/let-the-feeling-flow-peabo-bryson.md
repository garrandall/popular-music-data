Falling in love, it was easy at the start
I thought I had it in my hands
Something went wrong, somewhere we lost a part
It was more than we could stand, yeah

It was too late when I realized
That I couldn't see the forest or the trees
What was wrong with me?
There comes a time in every life
Love will come your way
And if it should stay you'd better hold on to it tight

And never let it go not love
It's a shining star that's here to guide you
Every lover knows
You've got to hold on to the good inside you
Let the feeling flow
And I'm sure love will grow

Falling in love, was so easy at the start
I thought I had it here in my hands, here in my hands
Something went wrong, somewhere I lost a part
More than I could stand, yeah

It was too late when I realized
That I couldn't see the forest or the trees
Something's wrong with me
There comes a time in every life
Love will come your way
And if it should stay you'd better hold on to it tight

And never let it go, not love
It's a shining star that's here to guide you
Every lover knows
You've got to hold on to the feeling inside you
Let the feeling flow
And I'm sure love will grow yeah, yeah

Let the feeling flow
Let it flow, let it flow
You've got, got to let let it flow
And surely love will grow, love will grow

Let the feeling flow
It's a shining star that's here to guide you
Every lover knows
You've got to hold on to the feeling inside you
