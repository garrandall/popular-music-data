From my heart I give thanks to you
For, stayin at my side was more than what I, sent you through
But havin faith in me, though I had none in myself
For givin all your love to me, instead of someone eles
Time after time you saved our love from destruction
Assuring me of, with your smile and affection
Now I feel the joy, the joy of every girl and boy
I said, you showed me how to be happy
You showed me how to be happy
I'd swallow all my pride, if I, were to say
I've been a perfect fool, a perfect fool in every way
I'll make it up to you, times I've hurt you so
The last thing I would do, honey, just to let you know
If I lose you now, I don't think I could make it
I don't see how my old heart would take it
To let my love miss out the happiness
That you're all about, I said that you
Showed me how to be happy, said you
Showed me how to be happy, baby
Once I was all alone and I did not
Have nobody for my own
You picked me up, did not let me down
And I'll love you for ever more
You make my day, seem brighter and brighter
You make my friends grow lighter and lighter
My life I would give for love, I'd gladly thank the Lord above
You, showed me how to be happy, baby
You showed me to how to be happy, baby
Every day of my life, I need somebody like you baby...
