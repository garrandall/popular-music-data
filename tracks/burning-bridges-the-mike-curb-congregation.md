Friends all tried to warn me
But I held my head up high
All the time they warned me
But I only passed them by
They all tried to tell me
But I guess I didn't care
I turned my back
And left them standing there


All the burning bridges
That have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings
And the burning memories
Everyone I left behind
Each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore


Joey tried to help me find a job
A while ago
When I finally got it
I didn't want to go
The party Mary gave for me
When I just walked away
Now there's nothing left for me to say


All the burning bridges
That have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings
And the burning memories
Everyone I left behind
Each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore


Years have passed and I keep thinking
What a fool I've been
I look back into the past and
Think of way back then
I know that I lost everything
I thought I that could win
I guess I should have listened to my friends


All the burning bridges
That have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings
And the burning memories
Everyone I left behind
Each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore


Burning bridges lost forevermore
