Dressed to kill and lookin' dynomite,
With her high-laced stockings and her sweater so tight.
I asked her her name, she said her name was "Maybe."

Well she walked up to me, and she asked me to chance
I said, "I am lookin' for some wild romance,"
She gave me a wink--she said I should think about it, maybe

She said, "What you got babe, is what I need.
Your kind of love got me on my knees."
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me, your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up, you got me so fired up

Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was comin' of age

If looks could kill, I'd be dead on the floor
You got me all tied up, honey, beggin' for more
Somebody call a doctor, I think I'm goin' crazy

(Because) What you got, babe, is what I need
Your kind of love got me on my knees
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me
Your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up
You got me so fired up

Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was come, come, comin' of....

Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was come, come, comin' of...
Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was come, come, comin' of age
She's come, come, comin' of age
Yeah she come, she come, she come
