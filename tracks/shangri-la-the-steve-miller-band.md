If you need some inspiration
Let's have a celebration
That's right
Cuz it's a real inspiration
When you're in communication
Celebrate
That's right
Do it right

Get your mind in the mood
Let your body feel the groove
Communicate with the one you really love

In your heart, in your soul
Take the time, let her know
Celebrate with the one you really love

Everywhere you are
You're in Shangri-La
Catch a shooting star
In Shangri-La

So don't you be hesitatin'
Don't you keep that girl a waitin'
Communicate with the one you really love

Cuz she's a real inspiration
When you're in communication
Celebrate with the one you really love

Let your fingers do the walking
Let your body do the talking
Communicate with the one you really love

Renew her faith in your love
Thank your lucky stars above
Celebrate with the one you really love

Everywhere you are
You're in Shangri-La
Catch a shooting star
In Shangri-La

Woooooooo
Yeaaaaaah
Woooooooo
Yeaaaaaah

In the evenin', late at night
Take your time, do it right
Communicate with the one you really love

Don't hesitate, let it show
Let your feelings really flow
Celebrate with the one you really love

Everywhere you are
You're in Shangri-La
Catch a shooting star
In Shangri-La

Everywhere you are
You're in Shangri-La
Catch a shooting star
In Shangri-La

Oohhhhhh
Oohhhhhh Shangri-La
Oohhhhhh
Oohhhhhh Shangri-La
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
