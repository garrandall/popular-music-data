Saw you 'round the other day
Shorty she was all the way
Looked like you were feeling me
So I had to come and see
Girl he wasn't tryin' to hate
But she had to demonstrate
That she was the queen to be
But she couldn't fight the chemistry
And I say...
I-I-I
I can't lose you, babe
I-I-I
Nooooo


She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor (Sugar)
She was oh so tight like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh


Girl it's just the sexy way
You back yourself into me
You're more then just a pretty face
You're better then a fantasy
Come on, baby
Don't ignore me
I know what you're feeling for me
You can't fight it
Cause you want me
Don't you miss this or you'll be sorry
So tell me what it's gonna take
You've got me all bent out of shape
Thinking 'bout you all day
And how you gonna make me wait
And I say..
I-I-I
I can't lose you
I-I-I
Woah


She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor
She was oh so tight like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor
She was oh so tight like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love


Ah, there's just something about you baby..
It's taking me over, I want you to know


Now it's on tonight
She took all control
Turned off all the lights
She said...don't you want to?
Na na na, na na na
Hey!
Na na na na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Na na na na na na
Oh, oh, oh
Tell a story
She was leaning on me
Getting horny
Maybe we'll get naughty
Tell a story
She was leaning on me
Getting horny
Maybe we'll get naughty



She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love
She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor
She moves across the floor
She was oh so tight like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was uh uh oh, uh uh oh
Blowin' me up with her love
Na na na, na na na, na na na na
She moves across the floor
Na na na na na na na na na na na na, no
Na na na na na na na na na na na na, no
O! she may! o! I can't get enough
Na na na na na na na na na na na na, no


She was disco lights on a Friday night
She moves across the floor
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
She was oh so tight like dynamite
Blowin' me up with her love
She was on the phone with me
All night long
I just can't get enough
She was ah ah oh, ah ah oh
Blowin' me up with her love
Ooo oo
