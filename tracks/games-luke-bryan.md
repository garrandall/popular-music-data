You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
But you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

This break-up, make-up,hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me, 
What am I supposed to do with you 

And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games
