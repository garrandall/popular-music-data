M-M-M-Murda

Workin' me, she workin' me (work)
Urgin' me, it be urgin' me
Chill it up the top of call the curtain please
I decided to go up like Major League
She just popped the perc and just like pokin' beans
She just popped the perc and say I hurt her knees
She hurtin' me, rich dawg Hercules

Two cups, Martel pour a neat (two)
Serve a fiend, fuck a bitch then go to sleep (serve, serve)
I need to get me a maid before we leave (give me)
No key pull up, remember me
Remember me, I'll remember me (hey)
Take 'em way back, Lil John energy (Lil John)
Pockets real fat, cash 'veal ten a key (yumba)
Fire a blunt, it done died off (whoop)
Ride off, bitches ride off, yeah (skrr)
Yo boss, he done died off, yeah (skrr)
I just cut the dirtiest stove and pot it off, yeah (hey)

Workin' me, she workin' me (work)
Urgin' me, it be urgin' me
Chill it up the top of call the curtain please
I decided to go up like Major League
She just popped the perc and just like pokin' beans
She just popped the perc and say I hurt her knees
She hurtin' me, rich dawg Hercules
She hurtin' me, rich dawg Hercules

I decided to go up like Major League
Call the plug, tell him bring the key (bring the key)
Then retire, where the fuck's JT (JT)
Bought a coupe and told a rapper, "race me" (skrr, skrr)
Remember when they used to curve me (swoop)
Now they want to represent my earnings (represent it)
If you want smoke, smoke be low on me (smoke smoke)
By yourself, no, bring your army
I'm having shit that going to extinct your whole family (extinct)
I put 'em out, I feel like he done broke the leaves
I put the work inside the wall behind the scene (work, work)
She attractin' all the dogs that work for me (grr)

Workin' me, she workin' me (work)
Urgin' me, it be urgin' me
Chill it up the top of call the curtain please
I decided to go up like Major League
She just popped the perc and just like pokin' beans
She just popped the perc and say I hurt her knees
She hurtin' me, rich dawg Hercules
She hurtin' me, rich dawg Hercules
