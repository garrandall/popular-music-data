I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out

Chicken Noodle Soup
Chicken Noodle Soup
Chicken Noodle Soup
Wit a soda on the side
Chicken Noodle Soup

Wit a soda on the side

From gwangju, han geosigiui Gang
Geumnam chungjang Street, geogin nae hallem
Nyureon ipdan, Bounce with ma Team
Chume ppeokga, wokeohollik, maeil
Sip daee bamsaeumyeo seongjanghan Case
Nae kineun chumeuro maegyeo I'm Ok
Keun bijeon geuryeoganeun Plan
Kkumeul kkeureoganeun ae
Rideum jireubamneun seutep

Popping, Rocking, Hopping, Tutting, Dougie, Flexing

Ajik maeil gachi hansibappi haji
Nal wihan il
Neul nareul chaejjik hae danggeuneun teuropie
Insaenge baeting hae chumeun naui Cash
Hope on the street ijen namanui gil
With Becky G on the side
Every day I lit

We always got love
For where we come from
So let em know what's up

No matta wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home (baby)
Now that you know that
Let me see you

Chicken noodle o pollo con espagetti
Ninguna de estas mujeres tiene el flow que tiene Becky
Latino americana soy de aquiii
Carita de santa pero freakyyy

Yeah
QuÃ© me va decir (huh)
Si ya to' lo vi (huh)
Donde yo nacÃ­
No pensaban que una mujer iba a sobresalir

What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do

Look back at it
Lights camera action
Definitivamente la mejor de la escena
Word on the street we got the people reactin'
La gente que critican simplemente me dan pena

We always got love
For where we come from
So let em know what's up

No matta wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home (baby)
Now that you know that
Let me see you

I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
