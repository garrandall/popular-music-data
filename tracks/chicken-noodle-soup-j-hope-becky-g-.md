From gwangju, han geosigiui Gang

Ajik maeil gachi hansibappi haji

Neul nareul chaejjik hae danggeuneun teuropie
Insaenge baeting hae chumeun naui Cash
Hope on the street ijen namanui gil
With Becky G on the side
Every day I lit

We always got love
For where we come from
So let em know what's up

No matta wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home (baby)
Now that you know that
Let me see you

Chicken noodle o pollo con espagetti
Ninguna de estas mujeres tiene el flow que tiene Becky
Latino americana soy de aquiii
Carita de santa pero freakyyy

Yeah
Qué me va decir (huh)
Si ya to' lo vi (huh)
Donde yo nací
No pensaban que una mujer iba a sobresalir

What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do what you gonna do

Look back at it
Lights camera action
Definitivamente la mejor de la escena
Word on the street we got the people reactin'
La gente que critican simplemente me dan pena

We always got love
For where we come from
So let em know what's up

No matta wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home (baby)
Now that you know that
Let me see you

I let it rain, I clear it out

And let's get it

From 광주, 한 거시기의 Gang
금남 충장 Street, 거긴 내 할렘
뉴런 입단, Bounce with ma Team
춤에 뻑가, 워커홀릭, 매일
십 대에 밤새우며 성장한 Case
내 키는 춤으로 매겨 I'm Ok
큰 비전 그려가는 Plan
꿈을 끌어가는 애
리듬 지르밟는 스텝

Popping, Rocking, Hopping, Tutting, Dougie, Flexing
Swaggin'
아직 매일 같이 한시바삐 하지
날 위한 일
늘 나를 채찍 해 당근은 트로피에
인생에 배팅 해 춤은 나의 Cash
Hope on the street 이젠 나만의 길
With Becky G on the side
Every day I lit

We always got love
For where we come from
So let em know what's up

No matta wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home (baby)
Now that you know that
