I feel like Superman
They gonna remember me
I think I know I can
Who says itâs hard to reach
Whoâs gonna stop me on the road to success
I donât know

They tried to break me down
But Iâm still on my feet
This cityâs full of life
So why is it hard to breathe
Oh why did God create this world so unfair
I donât know

Sometimes I feel like I canât run, I canât crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ainât nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But Iâm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms

I feel like moving back
Sometimes itâs hard to dream
The life I chose is past
Itâs moving without me
Who doesnât want a machine so they can go back in time
I donât know

My time went by too fast
Thereâs no one left but me
Iâve got a nine to five
And it gets the best of me
This is the life Iâm gonna live to the end
But Iâm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms

Sometimes I feel like I canât run, I canât crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ainât nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But Iâm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh 
When I lie down in your arms
