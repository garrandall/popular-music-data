I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
Where a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be

I will find my way, I can go the distance
I'll be there someday if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong



There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, as it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best



A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come shining through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Will come true

A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartache
'Cause whatever you wish for you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come shining through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
Oh, the dream that you wish will come true
Will come true
Ohh
