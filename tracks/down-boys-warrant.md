Certain things ya do really make me mad I must confess
The way the street light sihlouettes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets I think I've seen you but I really don't know
One million miles an hour headed out to where the down boys go

Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been
Ooo I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
I wanna go where the down boys go baby

You comb your hair put on your shades you look real cool
You're givin' me the runaround making me feel like a fool
Got a lot of nerve to call me cheap even though it's true
I don't care where go tonight take me along with you

Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been
Ooo I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
I wanna go where the down boys go baby

Certain things ya do really make me mad I must confess
The way the street light sihlouettes your thighs inside your dress

Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been
Ooo I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
I wanna go where the down boys go baby

Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
Where the down boys go?
Where they go?
