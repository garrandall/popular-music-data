Be carefull girls
For Mighty Joe
Be carefull!
He teaches you all that don't know.
He makes you cry
Before it's through

And I bet you like it too.
Did you hear about Mighty Joe?
Did you hear about Mighty Joe?
Beware
Beware when he is around.
Mighty Joe with the bass voice!

Mighty Joe was here last year
I tell you!
Just like you
I had no fear.
I fell for him
Baby

And then he made of me a woman.
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet thing.
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet thing.
I love you
Yes
I love you
I love you so bad.

He took my heart and in a sense

I swear he ain't got no sense.
When I said yeah
He's gone to town.
I warn you
He will let you down.
Did you hear about Mighty Joe?
Did you hear about Mighty Joe?
Beware
Beware when he is around.
Mighty Joe with the bass voice!
