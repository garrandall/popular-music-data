The kids are singing loud
Happy birthday, sweet sixteen
So I smile and hope that
My tears will not be seen

Because I'm much too old to cry
(Too old to cry)
But still too young to find out why
(To find out why)

Why I'm so lonely
It hurts to be sixteen

Don't think that you're grown up
When you become sixteen
Because like me, you'll see
You're only in between

They say that
You're too old for toys
(Too old for toys)
But still you're much
Too young for boys
(Too young for boys)

I hate to tell you
It hurts to be sixteen

I found a wonderful guy
(Wonderful guy)
I want to spend my life with him
(Spend my life with him)

They say we're too young to start
They're driving us apart
We're finished before we begin

I can't keep smiling through
Cause it hurts, sweet sixteen
This heart is over now
And you know what I mean

To all of you who have shown up
(Who have shown up)
Come back next year
When I've grown up
(When I've grown up)

But now please go
Because it hurts to be sixteen

(You know it hurts to be sixteen)
You know it hurts
(They say it hurts to be sixteen)
I said it hurts
(You know it hurts to be sixteen)
