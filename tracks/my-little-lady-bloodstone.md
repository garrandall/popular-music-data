She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me do right
When I'm doing wrong

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me feel better
When I'm feeling sad

I feel so good around her
Oh love, I'm glad I found her
She's been so good to me
I'll never set her free

Whenever we are alone
She knows how to turn me on
How could I help but love her
How could I help but love

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me do right
When I'm doing wrong

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me feel better
When I'm feeling sad

Sometimes when I'm not around
Other fellows try to shoot me down
She don't hear a word they say
She tells them to go away

Whenever we have a date
All she says is don't be late
How could I help but love her
How could I help but love

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me do right
When I'm doing wrong

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me feel better
When I'm feeling sad

She's my little lady

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me do right
When I'm doing wrong

She's my little lady
She keeps me together
Makes me feel better
When I'm feeling sad
