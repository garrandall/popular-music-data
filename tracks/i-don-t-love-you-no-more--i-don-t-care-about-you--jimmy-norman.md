Hello?
Hello girl!
Who's this?
This is me, and I just want to let you know

I don't love you no more
You and I are through
I don't love you no more
I'm gonna find someone new
Oh, I don't wanna be worried about Johnny and Jack
Don't wanna be? about keepin' track
Of all the things you do
'Cause I don't care about you

No, I don't love you no more
Done got you off my mind
Threw your picture out
Because I'm tired of your lies
Oh, I'm gonna start goin' out painting the town
When they ask about you, I'll say I put you down
Because I'm through
And I don't care about you

I tried going wrong
With all the things that you did
But still I didn't satisfy you
I cried and I pleaded and I begged baby
But still you went out and found someone new
Now your new love's grown old
And your luck is down
And you'll be looking for me woman
And I won't be found
Because I'm through
And I don't care about you
No, I don't love you no more baby
No, now I don't care about you
No, I don't care about you baby
No, I don't care about you
No, you did me wrong baby
No, I don't care about you
