I've been drivin' all night
My hand's wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head
That drives my heel
It's my baby callin'
Says: I need you here
And it's a half past four
And I'm shifting gear

When she is lonely
And the longing gets too much
She sends a cable
Coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar Love

The radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely
And I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort
Comin' in from above
Don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar Love

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort, coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a thing that's called
Radar Love
