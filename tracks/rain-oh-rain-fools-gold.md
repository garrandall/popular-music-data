I Heard some news this morning that the river is on the rise
If you don't know how to swim you better know how to fly
But I didn't listen got a mind of my own
So I crawled out on the edge of the limb
And waited for the ragin storm
Rain oh rain stop falling down on me
I'm losing my grip and I'm starting to slip
Rain oh rain please stop falling down
I can't swim and I can't fly
I'm afraid that I might drown
Saw a man in the mirror that I've never seen before
Looked and talked an awful lot like me
Said I tried to warn you
But you never heard a word I said
And now you're gonna have a price to pay
Your starting to fade away
Rain oh rain stop falling down on me
I'm losing my grip and I'm starting to slip away
Rain oh rain please stop falling down
I can't swim and I can't fly
I'm afraid that I might drown
Sometimes it's hard for a man torealize
That everything that you tried to doDon't always turn out right
Feeling kind of weak and mighty cold
Feels like I've been bought and I've been sold
Storm is raging deep inside my soul feeling alone
I Heard some news this morning that the river is on the rise
If you don't know how to swim you better know how to fly
But I didn't listen got a mind of my own
So I crawled out on the edge of the limb
And waited for the ragin storm
Rain oh rain stop falling down on me
I'm losing my grip and I'm starting to slip away
Rain oh rain please stop falling down
I can't swim and I can't fly I'm afraid that I might drown
