Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me
Your love should be this good

Baby, I gots to take this time to give you props
Cause you been making me scream so loud
That my neighbours call the cops
You're like a gangstress of love
So baby come and put your hit on me
Your shot is a bomb
And I'm always down for your love

Your love is a 187, takin' me to heaven
It's killin' me your love should be this good
Your love is a 187 takin' me to heaven
Your love is so good, your love

Baby, the things you do should be against the law
But there ain't no law that says that you can't
Break me off, baby
You can pump like a gauge
Or go faster than an automatic tank
That's why a 187 is the way I describe your sex

Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me
Your love should be this good
Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
Your love is so good
Your love

When you're humping and you're thumping
And you're making those sounds
Moanin' and groaning baby, yeah
Hope your tight
Cause we're moving all around
We're moving up and down

Well, I know you got the feeling
When you're calling my name
I can hear you call my name
Over and over and over again
Don't stop me there
Don't stop me there

I'm yearning for your 187
Drop the bomb on me
I'm yearning for your 187
Baby, drop the bomb on me
I'm yearning for your 187
Drop the bomb on me
I'm yearning for your 187
Baby, drop the bomb on me
