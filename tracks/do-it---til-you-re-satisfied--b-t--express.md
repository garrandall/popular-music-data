Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more
Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more

Thought I had enough
But I'm not tired
Oh no, I ain't satisfied

I thought I had enough
But I'm still ready to go
Oh, now I, now I, now I want some more

Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more
Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more

Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more
Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more

Ooh, well, I thought I had enough
But I'm still ready to go
Well, well, I thought I had enough
But now I want some more

Come on, come on
Gimme some more
I said come on
Gimme some more

I can't stop
'Cause I want some more
I can't stop
Ooh, I want some more

I can't stop
'Cause I want some more
I can't stop
Ooh, I want some more

Come on
Gimme some more
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more
Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more

Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more
Can't stop groovin' right now
Wanna do it some more

Ooh, well, I thought I had enough
But I'm still ready to go
Well, well, I thought I had enough
But now I want some more

Come on, come on down
Right now, I need it
Come on, come on down
It's all right

Come on, come on down
Gotta get it
Come on, come on down
Gotta get it, give it up

Give it up, come on, don't stop
Don't stop, give it up
Groovin', don't stop
Keep on movin'

I can't stop
'Cause I want some more
I can't stop
Ooh, I want some more

I can't stop
'Cause I want some more
I can't stop
Ooh, I want some more

Can't stop groovin' right now
I wanna do it some more
