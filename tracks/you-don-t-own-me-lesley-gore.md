You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys


And don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display 'cause


You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay


I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you


I'm young, and I love to be young
I'm free, and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please


And don't tell me what to do
Oh, don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display


I don't tell you what to say
Oh, don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you


I'm young, and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
