Ohh
Jay Sean (Jay Sean, Jay Sean)
2-0-1-2 (Nicki Minaj, Nicki Minaj), oh-yeah
It's alright, oh, it's alright


You know what they say
Life ain't always easy and every day
We're survivors
So forget the day
It's all about tonight; act a fool and start a riot, a-riot, be a rebel


Bottles poppin' til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' til 6AM
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up


We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world (Oh)
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like (Oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world


Yo, smiles, metaphors, and we pop pills
Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how the top feels
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
Lot of them try to do it, but it's not real
Wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
White curls in a hot pink Hot Wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives
You wink, it goes by
So we'll just get it with no edits
Anything goes, so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy
And let's just get right
Young money, cash money in the building
Let's go, the world ends tonight


Have a drink with me
And let's make tonight go down in history
In history, yeah
Lets make believe
It's the last 24 hours and this whole world is ours
Eternally, eternally


Hey, bottles poppin' til we can't stand (Can't stand)
We keep it rockin' til 6AM (6AM)
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up


We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world (Like it's the end of the world)
We gonna party like, like it's 2012 (like it's 2012)
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
I know, it ain't the end of the world (Oh)
We gotta live like it's the end of the world
We gotta party like (Oh)
So just, turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world


No, no, I'm not gonna follow
Anything that they say anymore
(Party like, like it's the end of the world)
It's never too late to start livin'
(Party like, like it's the end of the world)
So let's start it with here and right now


Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world (Oh)
We gonna live like it's the end of the world
We gotta party like (Oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world


The world
Because the world keeps spinnin'
The world keeps spinnin' around
