Emily's poems and I spend winters in my room
Words on the pages are set free
And as I rest my head upon the clouds
A cool breeze rushes over lifting me away
To a familiar place and your warm embrace


You're my dream lover I can find you in my mind
Won't you bring me to your castle in the sky
Dream Lover you can take me far away
Where blue skies and eternal love lie


Riding the carousel in circles lost in time
We're flying through the rainbow colors
Seems like we've met before I don't know where or when
Our laughter fills the air and you're always there


You're my dream lover I can find you in my mind
Won't you bring me to your castle in the sky
Dream Lover you can take me far away
Where blue skies and eternal love lie


No one else can understand
There is a part of me that only you can see


Dream lover I can find you in my mind
Won't you bring me to your castle in the sky
Dream Lover you can take me far away
Where blue skies and eternal love lie
