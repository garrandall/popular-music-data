When I find myself watching the time
I never think about
All the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now?

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when
I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but, oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
In the dark

Oh, the silence is broken
And no words are spoken but, oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
Oh baby, pulling me back
Back to love you

I know, I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little, I cry, I cry

I know, I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
In the dark

I can't let go, no, no, no, no, no
I can't let go, no, no
Can't let go, no, no, no, no
