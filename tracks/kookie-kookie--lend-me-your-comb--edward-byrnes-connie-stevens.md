KOOKIE, KOOKIE (LEND ME YOUR COMB)
Edward Byrnes & Connie Stevens

CONNIE: Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?
EDWARD: Well now, let's take it from the top & grab some wheels
& On the way we'll talk about some cuckoo deals.
C: But Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?

E: Now you're on the way, miss, & I'm readin' you just fine.
Don't cut out of here till we get on Cloud 9.
C: But Kookie?

E: I've got smog in my noggin ever since you made the scene
C: You're the utmost!
E: If you ever tool me out... dead, I'm the saddest, like a brain
C: The very utmost. Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?

E: Man, I got my bruise lighters in my flapsy-colored pen
You're gonna send me to that planet called... you know it, baby, the end!

(Sax solo)

C: Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?
E: If you ever cut out, you might be a stray cat
'Cause when I'm flyin' solo, nowhere's we're on that!
C: Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?

E: What's with this comb caper, baby? Why do you wanna latch up with my comb?
C: I just want you to stop combing your hair...& kiss me. You're the maximum utmost.
E: Well, I beans & I dreams goin', I'm movin' right now
'Cause that's the kind of scene that I dig... baby, you're the ginchiest!
