If you could feel
How I must feel
The winds of quiet change
If you could see
What I must see
Still hidden in the rain
But when the thunder rolls
It comes and covers up my soul
And you will take my hand
And be with me in wonderland
Chorus
I am an honest man
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too
If you could hear
What I must hear
Then nothing would replace
The fifty years of sweat and tears
That never left a trace
But when I look at you I see
You feel the same way too
And you will take my hand and be
With me in wonderland
Chorus
You still remember other days
When every head was high
I watched that pride be torn apart
Beneath a darker sky
With innocence within ourselves
We sing the same old song
And you will take my hand
And make believe it's wonderland
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too
Chorus
Wonderland (four times, fading out)
