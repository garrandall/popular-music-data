See that girl who's smiling so brightly
Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly
She's good looking and I ain't frightened
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly
My XKE is shining so brightly
The noose around us is slowly tightening
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly
My XKE is shining so brightly
The noose around us is slowly tightening
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning

You can't catch me, I'm as fast as can be
Call me lightning, I'm as fast as can be
No you can't catch me, no you can't catch me
