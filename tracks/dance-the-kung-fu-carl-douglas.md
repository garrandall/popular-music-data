Oho, dance the kung fu (I'll tell you what to do)
You just dance the kung fu, haha, y'all
Dance the kung fu (That's what to do)
You just dance the kung fu

You swing to your left
Then you swing to your right
This new dance, people
Is pure dynamite

Every step is poetry in motion
Let the rhythm take your devotion
So when you feel like you wanna fight
People listen to me, oh, don't get uptight
This is all, this is all you do

Oho, dance the kung fu (I'll tell you what to do)
Dance the kung fu, haha, y'all
Dance the kung fu (That's what to do)
You just dance the kung fu

You put your hand to the hand
Then you make a little stand
You jump and you dip
Your back up stiff

Moving with the grace of a butterfly
Take yourself away on a natural high
You feel like you wanna fight
Listen to me, people, don't get uptight
This is all, this is all you do

Oho, dance the kung fu (That's what you do)
Dance the kung fu, don't fight!
Dance the kung fu (Tell you what to do)
Dance the kung fu

Come on, move around
Never see what you're putting down
Step in line, come feel the groove
Doin' fine, you got nothing to lose

Dance the kung fu (This is all you do)
Dance the kung fu, don't fight, hey!
Dance the kung fu (Tell you what to do, y'all)
Dance the kung fu

Peace and love
Sweet as a flower
You can do this new dance
Hours and hours and hours
