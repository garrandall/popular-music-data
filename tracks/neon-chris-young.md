The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming 
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset, 
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow 
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all 
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer, 
But my favorite color is

Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel is Neon

The sun can do the job in the daytime,
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime for people like us
Just like a beachside beacon 
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted
That's why they invented

Neon, the light they always leave on
The weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel is always Neon

You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer,
But my favorite color is 

Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel is Neon
