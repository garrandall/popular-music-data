I had a talk
With my man last night
He reassured me everything
Was still all right

As the night grew light
My blues got bright
He made me know
I was the star of the show

He said he was mine
All to myself
I won't if he won't
Ever need nobody else

He took me in his arms
And turned on my alarm
Oh, yes, he did, yes, he did
Yes, he did, oh, yes
I had a talk with my man last night

I said I sat down and had
A talk with my man last night
He filled my heart with pure delight

He told me that he needed me
More than words could ever say
And then he went on to prove it
In such a sweet, sweet way

He said never again
Lonely will you be
And that's when he asked
To marry me

I began to cry
He kissed the tears
From my weeping eyes

Oh, yes, he did, yes, he did
Yes, he did, oh, yes
I had a talk with my man last night
