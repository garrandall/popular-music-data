White on white, lace on satin
Blue velvet ribbons on her bouquet
White on white, lace on satin
My little angel is getting married today

Here she comes in her wedding gown lookin' like a queen
She has been my only love since she was thirteen
I've been dreaming of this day and how proud I'd be
When she came walkin' down the aisle and held out her hand to me

White on white, lace on satin
Blue velvet ribbons on her bouquet
White on white, lace on satin
My little angel is getting married today

I'll be waiting to kiss the bride when her name is new
Standing oh, so close to her silently saying "I do"
I'll be holding back my tears till she's gone away
Cause she'll belong to someone else when the organ starts to play

White on white, lace on satin
Blue velvet ribbons on her bouquet
White on white, lace on satin
My little angel is ge-e-etting ma-a-rried today
