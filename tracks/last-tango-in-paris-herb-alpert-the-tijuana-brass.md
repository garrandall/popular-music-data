We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless
As yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your veinis as lifeless
As yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not
By choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We are shadows who dance
