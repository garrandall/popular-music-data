Coming to you live 
from the city of
HoustalantaVegas


I am on a 24 hour champagne diet
Spillin' while I'm sippin' I encourage you to try it
Im probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, Boy I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what I made it, I'm the muhfuckin man I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga, quit frontin' on me
Don't come around and try to gas me up, I like runnin on E
I I I I'm on my Disney shit, Goofy flow
On records I'm captain Hook and my new car is Rufio
Damn where my roof just go?
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin something cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go?
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl
I got em


They can't help it
And I can't blame em'
Since I got famous
Bitch I got money to blow
Gettin' it in, 
letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow


Richer than the Riches
We certified gettin' it
CM YM Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling
Fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci store and later get served
We smoked out, with no roof on it
Them people passin' so we smash on em'
Bindin out we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and them Bentleys on the v-set
Loui lense iced up with the black diamonds
Cardier, Ferarri the new Spyder
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights but my bitch in
Born hustlin', too big nigga to size me up
Kept stuntin', more money, burn it up


They can't help it
And I can't blame em'
Since I got famous
Bitch I got money to blow
Gettin' it in, 
letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow


Well I get paid every 24 hours, money and the power
Come to VIP and get a champagne shower
I don't have to worry cause everything ours
And I got a big bauecet of mary jane's flowers
That Kush, I promise thats my boo boo we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with two women make you take a second look
We poppin like champagne bottles but we never shook
And we gone be alright if we put Drake on every hook


They can't help it
And I can't blame em'
Since I got famous
Bitch I got money to blow
Gettin' it in, 
letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow
I got money to blooow ooow ooow oow ooow oow
