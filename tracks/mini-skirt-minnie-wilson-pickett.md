Mini-skirt Minnie, lord have mercy, you're the baddest thing around
Mini-skirt Minnie, huh, look what you're puttin' down, look here
Now when you walk that walk, yeah baby, you know you look so fine
When you talk that talk, oh child, you know you just drive men out of their minds
You got me slippin' around, chippin' 'round, sneakin' 'round, peeepin' 'round
Oh baby, ow! The taste of your love

Mini-skirt Minnie, you know you really come on strong, yeah
You got a hold on me chasin' after you, baby
You've got the women cryin' & carryin' on, oh yeah
You know you wear your dresses so high
You stop the traffic when you walk by
& the way you twist & carry on, you know what?
You're gonna break up a lot of happy homes
You got me slippin' around, chippin' 'round, sneakin' 'round, peeepin' 'round
Oh baby, ow! The taste of your love

Mini-skirt Minnie, yeah, you know I'm gonna pull your mini-skirt down, yeah
Mini-skirt Minnie, yeah yeah, I dig what you're puttin' down, gone with your fancy
A taste of your love, that's all I want; just a taste of your love, I've got to have it
A taste of your love, child
... & fade
