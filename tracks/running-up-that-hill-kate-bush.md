It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?

You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby
There's so much hate for the ones we love
Tell me we both matter, don't we?

You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me, won't be unhappy
(If I only could, be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh

C'mon, baby
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could
Be running up that hill
...
