You just crossed my mind
Like a border with no wall up
It made me smile
For a moment
The world that we've designed
It comes with the colour
But not the spite
This place is golden
I believe you when
You say that you love me
I know it's true
Because you own it
I don't need to make
Any changes you want me
Oh you want me

Girl I lived my life wrong
For much much too long
But I think I forgot that when we started
And I will swear to you

Girl I'll be there for you
But I don't think you understand

I will hold you
Like I'm supposed to and kiss you

Like it's the last time, I need you
This has to go right
Any mountain I'll climb
'Cause you're, the love of my life

It's been on my mind
But every time that I'm caught up
It never dies, it's too important
You're always on my side
Even when I'm left cornered
It feels amazing
I will not forget, never will regret
All of these moments
When I lose my breath, that is not a threat

'Cause you will have caught it
Even after death, all the love we've set
Out in the past
Won't get left in the dark
Oh-oh, oh-no

Girl I lived my life wrong
For much much too long
But I think I forgot that when we started
And I will swear to you
Girl I'll be there for you

But I don't think you understand

I will hold you
Like I'm supposed to and kiss you
Like it's the last time, I need you
This has to go right
Any mountain I'll climb
'Cause you're, the love of my life

I will hold you
Like I'm supposed to and kiss you
Like it's the last time, I need you
This has to go right
Any mountain I'll climb
'Cause you're, the love of my life
