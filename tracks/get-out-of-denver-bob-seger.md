I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'
Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further
All our fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
Had my girl beside me brother.
Brother she was burnin' burnin'

Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
The cops came bustin' in and then we lit out in our pickup truck go

Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member better
Better Get out of Denver
Better Get out of Denver

Well red lights were flashin' and the sirens were a-screamin'
We had to pinch each other just to see if we was dreamin'
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower

The rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber
We kept on drivin' till we ran into some fog cover
We couldn't see a thing somehow we just kept on goin'
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'fog.
It finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
We're starin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat

And go Get out of Denver he said go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member
Better get out of Denver
Better get out of Denver better go

Oh better better better go
Hey go
Ah better better go go go go
Cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member better
Get out of Denver better go!
