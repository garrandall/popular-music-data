Come here
I don't know what happened

Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore oh girl
I need to know
Is it me, and did I lose control?
(oh babe slow it down)

Lonely overseas
Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no fights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason what this happened for
(But I can't help but feel like)

Lonely overseas
Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

Bounce

Lonely overseas
Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
