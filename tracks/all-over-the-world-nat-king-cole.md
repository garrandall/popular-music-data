All over the world
All over the world

Love is the thing
It's the one thing, you'll see
All that it takes
Is a he and a she

All over the world
All over the world

Love was and love is
And always will be
All over the world

(Whether you're in
Maine or California
Doesn't matter, I know
You can be in Tennessee or
You can be in old Mexico)

(It can happen
Summer, spring or fall or
When the winter winds blow
Love is a wonderful thing)

Lovers can be found
In foggy London town
In Rome or Peru

Even in Damascus
Lovers never ask us
What they should do

You don't have to park
In Paris after dark
To know that it's true
Love is a wonderful thing

All over the world
All over the world

Love was and love is
And always will be
All over the world
All over the world
