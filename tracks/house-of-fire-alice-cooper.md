House of fire
House of fire
Yeah!

Let's build a house of fire, baby
Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on in and make it your home
Don't need a window to watch you, baby
Don't need no roof overhead
Don't need no key to unlock ya, baby
I'll use my lovin' instead
I won't tire
Take me higher

Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are buildin' a house of fire every time we touch

House of fire
House of fire

We ain't gotta pay rent now, baby
No landlord to throw us out
I want to play in your garden, baby
When you want it give me a shout
I won't tire
Take me higher

Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are buildin' a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down
Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
