The world of bright lights,
Of fortune and fame,
Where everybody struggles,
Tryin' to make themselves a name.

Oh,
It's a world full of promises,
That sometimes don't ever come true.
It's an old, old business,
Such a cold, cold business.
It's like no business I know.

There ain't no business like show, show business.
It's like no, no business I know.

There's a world of big dreams,
Of laughter and tears,
Where sometimes your fame,
Is just a? on a?

Oh, oh,
It's a world of promises,
That sometimes don't ever come true, now.
And it's a rough, rough business.
Such a tough, tough business.
But it's my business, it's my life.

Your business,
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Show business,
That's what I'm talkin' about.

Today you're nobody,
Tomorrow a star.
The day after that,
Nobody knows who you are.

There's an in-betweenin',
And behind-the-scene'in', and
They hardly leave you cent.

And there's them good days,
And there's some bad, bady days,
Where you hardly pay your rent.

Woah oh.
But it's a world of music,
That somehow gets under your skin.
Oh yeah,
There ain't no, no business,
Like show, show business.
It's like no business,
That I know.

There ain't no business,
Like show, show business.
I tell there ain't no business like it, I know.

Talkin' 'bout show business!
Talkin' 'bout...
