Melt Antarctica, savinâ Africa
I failed algebra and I miss you sometimes
Weâre at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you canât smoke inside

You said, âTake me home, I canât stand this place
âCause thereâs too many hipsters and I just canât relate.â
Youâre my neon gypsy, my desert rain
Youâre my âHelter Skelterâ, oh how can I explain that

Youâre the best I ever had
And Iâm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I've read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On a bathroom wall where I saw your name
Youâre the best I ever had
I wonât be the same

Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
Iâm looking at the crowd and theyâre staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (oh, God!)
And maybe once a year I think to clean my car

Caught my reflection, dropped the call
Iâve been medicating with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I canât see straight
I got obligations though Iâm usually late but

Youâre the best I ever had
And Iâm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
Youâre the best I ever had
I wonât be the same

Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota
I think I love you, but donât even know you
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota
I think I love you, but donât even know you
Hey Carolina, Hey Oklahoma
I think I love you, but donât even know you
Hey Alabama, Hey California
I think I love you, but donât even know you

Youâre the best I ever had (youâre the best I ever had)
And Iâm trying not to get stuck in my head (not to get stuck in my head)
But I passed a lonely sign on the interstate
Saying, âFind someone 'fore it gets too late!â
Youâre the best I ever had (youâre the best I ever had)
I wonât be the same

Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota (Oh why, oh why)
I think I love you, but donât even know you (I wonât be the same)
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota (youâre the best I ever had)
I think I love you, but donât even know you (I wonât be the same)

Yeah, I wonât be the same
