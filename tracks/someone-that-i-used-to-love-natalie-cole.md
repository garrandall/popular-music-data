When I wake up each morning trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure, I always remind myself
Though you're someone in this world that I'll always choose to love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love

As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care if I have to lose your love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love

Wish it was enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried, I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, you won't find me being the one to get lost again
Once I had so much to give but you just refused my love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love

I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried, I really tried

When I wake up each morning trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure, I always remind myself
Though you're someone in this world that I'll always choose to love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love

Though you're someone in this world that I'll always choose to love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love
From now on you're only someone that I used to love
