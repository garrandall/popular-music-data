I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'
Every little river, runnin' through your mind
You give and you take
You come and you go
You leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know
How much you care or how much you don't
Whatever you need, whatever you want


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine


I guess that all I'm tryin' to tell ya
Is a minute with you is better than two without
Oh, I won't be a fool but I can't play it cool
So I'm playin' it safe and I'm breakin' the rules
I'm wishin' I had what I know that you got
So if you're comin' my way then please don't stop


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine


If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Or somebody's mistake
Somebody's first time, or their last time
Baby, be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak)
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's mistake)
Oh, I'll take my chances
If you're gonna be someone's heartbreak
If you're gonna be someone's mistake
Somebody's first time, somebody's last time
Be mine
Oh, be mine
Be mine
Baby, baby, baby, be mine, all mine
If you're gonna break someone's heart, yeah
Might as well, might as well be mine
