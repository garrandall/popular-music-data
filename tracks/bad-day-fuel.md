Had a bad day again
She said I would not understand
She left a note and it said - "I'm sorry I had a bad day again"
She spilled her coffee, broke her shoelace
Smeared the lipstick on her face
Slammed the door and said - "I'm sorry I had a bad day again"


And she swears there's nothing wrong
I hear her playing that same old song
She puts me off and puts me on
And had a bad day again


She said I would not understand
Left a note and it said - "I'm sorry I had a bad day again"
Nahahah


And she swears there's nothing wrong
I hear her playing that same old song
She puts me off and puts me on
Oh and had a bad day again


She said I would not understand
She left a note and it said -"I'm sorry I had a bad day again"
She left a note and it said, - "I'm sorry I had a bad day"
