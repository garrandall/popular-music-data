My uncle used to love but she died 
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried 
Keep on the sunny side 
My uncle used to love me but she died 

Who'll bid me quarter, thirty cents for a ring of keys 
Three sixty-five for a dollar bill of groceries 
I'll have me a car of my own someday but 'til then I need a ride (thanks Steve) 
My uncle used to love me but she died 

My uncle used to love but she died 
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried 
Keep on the sunny side 
My uncle used to live me but she died 

Hamburger cup of coffee lettuce and tomato 
Two times a dime to see a man kiss the alligater 
One more time around free on the ferris wheel ride 
My uncle used to love me but she died 

My uncle used to love but she died 
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried 
Keep on the sunny side 
My uncle used to live me but she died 

Apples are for eatin and snakes are for hissin 
I've heard about a'huggin and I've heard about kissin 
I read about it free in a fifty cent illustrated guide 
My uncle used to love me but she died 

My uncle used to love but she died 
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried 
Keep on the sunny side 
My uncle used to live me but she died 

Well my uncle used to love but she died 
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried 
Keep on the sunny side 
My uncle used to live me but she died
