Lonely lady living down the hall
Don't you have any friends at all
I never hear a knocking at your door
Could it be you just don't try anymore?
You've been hurt so seriously
You act so cold but it's so easy to see
You're a waste of real good love
But you can't hide or run fast enough

Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
Hidden inside of you
Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine

I know exactly how a heartache feels
It's gonna take a little time to heal
Why must you hide away inside yourself
You could mean so much to someone else
Every night while you're sittin' at home
You may be lonely but you're not alone
There's a whole world full of people out there
Waiting on someone like you to care

Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
Hidden inside of you
Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine

Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
Hidden inside of you
Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine
