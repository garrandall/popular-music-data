Get out, damn it
Close the door, don't slam it
Let me be alone a while
To give my nerves a rest

Whatever you do I love you
No matter what you do I love you
And I want to run out after you
But I don't know what's best

If you will take good care of me
I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

You will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

Hours later
I hear the key in the front door
We look each other in the eye
A timid sorry pair

There's a little more conversation
A little more conversation
A battle's lost and a war is won
I think we've cleared the air

You will take good care of me
I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

If you will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

You will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

You will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker
