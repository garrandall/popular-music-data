I miss those blue eyes
How you kiss me at night
I miss the way we sleep
Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe


But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in


And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe it, I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you


I see your blue eyes
Every time I close mine
You make it hard to see
Where I belong to
When I'm not around you
It's like I'm not with me


But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in


And now I miss everything about you (Still you're gone)
I can't believe it, I still want you (Having loving you, I never should've walked away)
After all the things we've been through (I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you, whoa
(Oh, no)


But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in


And now I miss everything about you (Still you're gone)
I can't believe it, I still want you (Having loving you, I never should've walked away)
After all the things we've been through (I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you, whoa


Oh no, no
Mmm, no
Mmmm
