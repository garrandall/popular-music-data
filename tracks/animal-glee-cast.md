Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na


Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied


Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide


I do it every time
You're killin' me now


And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Woah, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'

Here we go again (Oh oh)
Here we go again (Oh oh)
Here we go again (Oh oh)
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
