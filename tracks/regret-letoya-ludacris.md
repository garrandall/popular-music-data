You must regret the day that you loved me
(ohh yeah)
You must regret the day that you left me.


I made you cool
You wasnt that dude
Until I started with you
Gave you swagg, and a duffel bag
You left the best you had
now you gotta act like that
I got you right
I changed your life
Suicide doors I cosigned
Gucci bags, louis travel bags
You left the best you had, baby dont look so mad


You must regret the day that you left me
You must regret the day that you left me
You still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (Get back with me oh)
Still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (back with me oh)


VIP was all on me
Now youre at the bar with 1 or 2 drinks
Poppin game, you look so lame
Without me your pimpin aint the same
First class flights
Dip in nite
I had your neck and wrist oh so bright
Poppin tags, is a thing of the past
You lost the things you had chasin those scallywags


You must regret the day that you left me
You must regret the day that you left me
You still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (Get back with me oh)
Still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (back with me oh)


Hey sexy, tell em that its over
Tell em you my baby and my Coupe is your stroller
Tell em this Louis Vuitton scarf is ya bib
Or that you call me daddy and my house is ya crib
And if he cries I know how to control that
Give him some bottle of this Conjua Conyan
Just to Shut him up
she said you wasnt half the man I am so I guess she had to double up
He still tryin to get back like the soldiers
Dreamin and its time to wake him up like Folgers
I told her you used to put a load of shit up on her braid but you lame now it over
I keep her by my side like a holster
I plan to make a full house and I aint talkin bout poker
But I might Poke her and just stroke her
Cuz im about to treat her like a real man suppose to
LUDA!!


You must regret the day that you left me
You must regret the day that you left me
You still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (Get back with me oh)
Still tryin to get back (get back)
Still tryin to get back (back with me oh)
