I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way


Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you


You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)


People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through


In the long run
Oh, I want to tell you
It's a long run


You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you


Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?


Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)


Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'


In the long run
Oh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run


Gonna find out, oh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Oh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long
