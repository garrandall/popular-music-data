Lover you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories
Here's your friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your love letters
I can't read 'em anymore

Lover you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear
(Come and get 'em)
That you won for me at the state fair
Here's some old Valentine cards
(Come and get 'em)
Give them to your new sweetheart

Lover you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come and get
Come and get
Come and get

Here's our old favourite record
(Come and get 'em)
I can't stand to hear it anymore
Here's some old lingering love
(Come and get 'em)
That's in my heart and it's tearing it apart

Because of these memorize
I never think of anybody but you
So come on and get 'em
Cause I've found me somebody new

Come and get these memories so my heart
(Come and get 'em)
And my mind can be at ease
(Come and get 'em)
Since you're gone out of my life
Give them to your new love
Give them to your new love
So come and get these memories.
