Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read them any more

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear
That you won from me at the state fair
Here's some old valentine cards
Give it to your new sweetheart

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's our old favorite record
Can't stand to hear it anymore
It's just an old lingering love song
It's in my heart and it's tearing it apart, tearing it apart

Because of these memories
I never think of anybody, never think of anybody but you

So, come on and get'em, come on and get'em baby
Come on and get'em and let me found somebody new

Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
My mind and heart can be at ease
Since you've gone out of my life

Give them to your new love
Give them to your new love
So come on and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Since you've gone out of my life
Since you've gone out of my life
