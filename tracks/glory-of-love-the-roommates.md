Win a little, lose a little
And maybe sing the blues a little.
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love.

Give a little, take a little,
And let your poor heart break a little.
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love.

Long as there's the two of us,
We'll have the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us,
We'll have each other's arms.

Win a little, lose a little
And maybe sing the blues a little.
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love.
