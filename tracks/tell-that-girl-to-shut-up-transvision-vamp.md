Well you got that girl and she lives with you
And she does just want you want her to
And when I call you on the phone, she says you're not there
But I know you're home-

You better tell that girl to shut up
You better tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl

Well we used to be the best of friends
Now all that's gonna have to end
But there's just one thing that I can't see
How she's got got you hanging up on me

You better tell that girl to shut up
You better tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl

Well I guess you're like that all of the time
But it takes more than that for me to loose my mind
Don't you know that I don't care?
Maybe if I hit her, maybe if I pulled her hair
Oh oh hey yey yeah

Well, she likes to seem intellectual
And to be a musician she goes to school
And the way she acts is so uncool
I just can't stand her

You better tell that girl to shut up
You better tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl

Ohyou better tell, yeah you better tell, oh
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl

Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

You better tell that girl to shut up
You better tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl to shut up!
