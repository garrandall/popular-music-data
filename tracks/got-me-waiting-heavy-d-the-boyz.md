Just when I thought I found me someone I can go with just
When I thought I found me someone I can go with that's
When my girl friend came to me, said she told me that nigga
Ain't nothing I seen him in the club, acting like he won't, no
Where around that's when I found out that you was nothing
For me and all the love that you said that you had
It turned out to be funny and I done gave you the best part
I don't know what else I can do to turn you around no
You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I am telling you everything you
Need to hear like baby, come, now you
Got me waiting but I can't keep waiting
On you acting like whatever I will always
Be around 'cause you think that you
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me, ohh baby, now you got me waiting
But I can't keep waiting on you, ohh
Look at me and tell me now if I can be the last one that that
You think about thinking you, can keep running out my life
My life my life why is it's so hard for you to pick up the phone
And call me put a little time in for me to show that you really care for
Me remember how you used to say
That nothing comes before me
You now it was a lie because you put your
Boys before me promises, promises
Made and broken still I keep
Holding on thinking you would that notice that
You got me waiting you got me waiting
When I telling you everything you need
To hear like baby, come, now you got me
Waiting but I can't keeping waiting on you
Acting like whatever I will always be
Around 'cause you think that you're something
Like a pimp and you can hang in these streets
And it will be all right with me but baby, you
Got me waiting and I can't keep waiting on you
There comes a time in every man's life
Where he has to do everything his girl
Likes because if he don't choose to
Play by the rules I am sure there's
Somebody else out there who just would love
Too do me hold me go the extra mile
Like you did when you was trying to
Get to no me do me hold me treat me
Nice and show me all the things you
Forgot to show me 'cause
You got me waiting got me waiting
When I am telling you everything
You need to hear like baby, come
Now you got me waiting but I can't
Keep waiting on you acting like
Whatever 'cause I will always be
Around 'cause you think that you're
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me you got me waiting but I can't keep waiting on you
