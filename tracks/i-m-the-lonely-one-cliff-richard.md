Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry
Well, you don't know how much I miss you so
But now it's done, now I'm the lonely one

You heard me say upon that rainy day
"Please set me free 'cos I don't want to know!"
Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry

Well you don't know how much you mean to me
I love you so, baby, come on home
I hope and pray that you'll come back someday
I'll have my fun, now I'm the lonely one
Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry
Well, you don't know how much I miss you so
But now it's done, now I'm the lonely one

You heard me say upon that rainy day
"Please set me free 'cos I don't want to know!"
Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry

Well you don't know how much you mean to me
I love you so, baby, come on home
I hope and pray that you'll come back someday
I'll have my fun, now I'm the lonely one

I'll have my fun, now I'm the lonely one
