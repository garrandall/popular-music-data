Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one with a ribbon on it

And all of a sudden you went left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me
Do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love-swept
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug

The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me
Do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

'Cause now I feel like, oh
You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed, using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease


Now ladies give me that

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Now give me that

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 


Now ladies give me that

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Now give me that

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
