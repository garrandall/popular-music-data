It's time to jam...

Ta... ta... ta... ta... take it while it's hot
So won't you come inside

Take it while it's hot
Take it while it's hot, give it all you got
Take it while it's hot

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've always dreamed this was the way that it could be
Just like a fantasy, your hear along with me
So now it seems we've slipped into reality
And it's plain to see this is our destiny
Feelings I try to hold just seem to take control
I lie awake, my body shakes with just one thought of you
The door is open wide so won't you come inside
And do those special things that lovers do

Take it while it's hot, I think the time is right
Take it while it's hot, I want your love tonight
Give it all you got, don't let this feeling end
Take it while it's hot, cause it may not come again

Sometimes I'm shy but now I think that you should know
The deeper that we go, the more my feelings show
Time passes by just like good things come and go
So light the candles babe, and I'll make a wish and blow
I love the way you groove, I'm gonna make this move
It's time to live, I wanna give you what your waiting for
The lights are pink and low, I think we're good to go
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more

Come, come, come, come inside
Come again
Come, come, come, come inside
Can't, can't, can't wait
