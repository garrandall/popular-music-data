It felt so easy in the morning sun
When love was in season I was on the run
I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face
One touch should've told me, try and understand
Love was always a long shot to a gambling man
With a roll of the dice, girl I threw it away
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day

*Didn't know it was love
Didn't know it was fate
Didn't know it was destiny callin'
Tell me it's never too late
Was I too blind to see
When push came to shove
You were all that I needed
Didn't know it was love*

Wasn't blind to the magic, you think I'm so tough
Turning back on the thunder just ain't good enough
I keep trying to shake you, there just ain't no way
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day

(* Repeat)

Those crazy nights on the borderline
Did my best to cut myself free
Stood alone, just a prisoner
Never knew you were holdin' the key

(* Repeat)
