Your own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares (ooh)
Your own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there, hey

Feelings unknown and you're all alone
With your flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer (believer)

Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest you need to confess
I'll deliver
You know I'm a forgiver (forgiver)

Well, reach out, touch faith
(Ahh) Reach out, touch faith

Your own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares (ooh)
I got my own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Yeah, your own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares (ooh)
Yeah, my own personal Jesus (Jesus)
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there, hey

Come on (ahh), reach out, touch faith
Come on (ahh), reach out and touch faith, wooh
(Aah) You gotta reach out and touch faith
Come on, reach out and touch faith

(Your own personal Jesus)
(Your own personal Jesus)
Yeah, my own (personal Jesus) Jesus
I got my own (Your own personal Jesus)
Reach out and touch faith
(Your own personal Jesus)
Reach out and touch faith
(Your own personal Jesus)
Come on, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
