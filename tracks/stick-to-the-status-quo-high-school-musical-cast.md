You can bet there's nothing but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control


Everybody gather 'round


Well if Troy can tell his secret than I can tell mine... I bake


What?


I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pan dowdy!


Not another sound


Someday I hope to make the perfect crÃªme brÃ»lée!


No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo


Look at me and what do you see
Intelligence beyond compare
But inside I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share


Open up, dig way down deep


Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break!


Is that even legal?


Not another peep


It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework


No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo


Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly


Speak your mind and you'll be heard


Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm coming clean! I play the cello!


Awesome!


What is it?


A saw?


No, dude, it's like a giant violin!


Not another word


Do you have to wear a costume?


Coat and tie


No, no, no, no...
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo


Oh, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo


This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Something is really


Something's not right


...really wrong


And we gotta get things
Back where they belong
We can do it


Gotta play


Stick with what you know


We can do it


Hip hop hooray!?


She has got to go


We can do it


CrÃªme brÃ»lée?


Keep your voice down low


Not another peep
No, not another word
No, not another sound
No


Everybody quiet!


Why is everybody staring at you?


Not me, you


Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't!

No! No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

Oh, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Don't you stick to the status. No!
Stick to the status. No!
Stick to the status quo
