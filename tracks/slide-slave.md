Yeah, slide to me
Won't you come away?
Don't worry baby, everything's okay

You can't run the game, if you don't know my name
I'll take you where you've never been before
There's something for you, a whole lot more
You ain't got to seek, everyone knows you're a freak

Slide, slide, slide
Yeah, baby baby, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Why don't you slide?

Don't be afraid 'cause you gonna be laid
I need you now don't let me down
You're a low down lady, but your game is kinda shaky
 when you want to get down

Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Why don't you slide?

You can slide, don't think I'm on it
You can slide, don't think I'm on it
You can slide, don't think I'm on it
You can slide, don't think I'm on it
