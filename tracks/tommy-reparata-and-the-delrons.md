He's not so sweet
And he's far from polite
Hardly ever calls me
And comes to pick me up late every night

Tommy
Would always send me pretty flowers
Tommy
Would call me on the phone
And talk for hours
He's not the same boy I knew back then
But I love Tommy
More then I did then

Tommy
Would always whisper little sweet things
Tommy
Would make a date
And never keep me waiting
He's not the same boy I knew back when
But I love Tommy
More then I did then

â€˜Cause lately
He's not so sweet
And he's far from polite
Hardly ever calls me
And comes to pick me up late every night

Tommy
Although he treats me so unkind now
Tommy
I just seem to get him off my mind now
He's not the same boy I knew back when
But I love Tommy
More than I did then

Tommy (Tommy)
Tommy (Tommy)
Tommy (Tommy)
