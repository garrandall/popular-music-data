You are so wonderful
That being near you is all I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever


'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one


In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothing, baby, in return


You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one


Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darling, you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one


You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one


Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence you speak to me
Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek
It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter


'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one


Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darling, you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
