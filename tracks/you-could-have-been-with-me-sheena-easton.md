You're the seventh son of the seventh son
Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else

You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul, but you cannot make him think

Chorus:
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely

You can tell him the day of departure, exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there, but he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you

Chorus repeats 2x

Chorus repeats out
