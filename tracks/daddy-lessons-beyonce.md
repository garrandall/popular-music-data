Yee-haw
Oh, oh, oh
Texas, Texas (oh oohohohexas

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
(Oh, oh ooh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
(Oh, oh ooh
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And oh, that's when he gave to me...

With his gun and his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

(Oh, oh ooh
Yee, woo
(Oh, oh ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said, girl, it's your second amendment
(Oh, oh ooh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember...

He said, take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me...

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause he held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)

(Oh, oh ooh
(Oh, oh ooh
(Oh, oh ooh
(Oh, oh ooh
(Yeehaw)

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, baby girl, he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, baby girl, he's playing you
He's playing you
'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

(Good job Bey, hahaha)
