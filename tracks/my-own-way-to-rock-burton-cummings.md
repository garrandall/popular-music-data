Revvin' up my engine
I'm like a 747, baby
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
And I'm mean
Revvin' up my engine, baby
Like a 747, mama
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
What a scene

I'm gonna take my silver dollar
Change it into quarters
Shove 'em in the record machine

Baby said she loved me
But then she went and left me
Causin' such an awful scene
What a scene
Baby said she needed me, you know
But then she went and left me
Causin' such an awful scene
What a scene, yeah

Take my silver dollar
Change it into quarters
Shove 'em in the record machine, yes

'Cause I got my own way to rock
I got my own way to roll
And when you're walkin' that walk
It's good for your soul

You know I'm singin' 'bout my own way to rock
I got my own way to roll
And when you're walkin' that walk
It's good for your soul

Revvin' up my engine, baby
Like a 747
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
What a scene
Revvin' up my engine, baby
Like a 747, mama
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
What a scene, yeah

Take my silver dollar
Change it into quarters
Gonna shove 'em in the record machine

'Cause I got my own way to rock
I got my own way to roll
And when you're walkin' that walk
It's good for your soul

Hey you know I'm talkin' 'bout my own way to rock
I got my own way to roll
And when you're walkin' that walk
It's good for your soul

Be-Bop-A-Lula, babe
Wake Up, Little Susie
Yes it's me and I'm In Love Again
Come on lover, got a Whole Lotta Shakin'
Well, I like it like that, yeah

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
