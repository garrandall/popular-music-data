Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fan base
A couple niggas with a suit case
Suit and tie niggas who play role play
When it comes to money she play no games

She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She'd rather die in lusting
She'd rather die in the club, till she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under, six
Six feet under
Six feet under, six
Six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under, six
Six feet under
Six feet under, six
Six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder

Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
Till she..

Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (till she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (till she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around
