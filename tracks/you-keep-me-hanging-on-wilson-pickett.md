Set me free
Why don't you ba'y
Get out my life
Why don't you baby

You don't really love me
You just keeps me hangin' on oo

Why do you keep comin' round
Playin' with my heart no no
Why don't you get on out of my life
And let me make a brand new start ooh oo

Set me free
Why don't you baby
Get out my life
Why don't you baby lord

You don't really need me
You just keeps me hangin' on ooh

You said when we broke up
You wanted to just be friends huh
But how can we still be friends
When seein' you only breaks my heart again 'gain lord

Hey
(Set me free why don't you babe
Get out my life why don't you babe)
It's my life
(Set me free why don't you babe)
It's my life
(Get out my life why don't you babe)
Ooooh baby

Mmm
(Get out my life why don't you babe)
You know you don't love me
(Set me free why don't you babe)
You know you don't love me no more lord
(Get out my life why don't you babe)
I'm beggin' you
(Set me free why don't you babe)
Set me set me free baby
(Get out my life why don't you babe)
Lord
(Set me free why don't you babe)
Oooh

Woah yeah yeah yeah
(Set me free why don't you babe)
Mmm

Why don't you ba'y
I'm growin' weaker
Day by day

You don't really love me
No no
You keep me hangin' on

Hangin' on

Hangin' on

Hangin' on like your puppet on a string baby
My life to you don't mean a doggone thing

I'm hangin' baby

Mmm mmm-hmm-hmm yeah

I'm hangin' on

Hangin' on yeah

I'm hangin' on baby

You know what I'm talkin' about
