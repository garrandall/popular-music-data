Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)
Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)

Our love, our love
Our love is going up in smoke
Where there's smoke
There's always fire

Your kisses leave me hanging
Hanging from a rope
Pull me up, oh darling
Take me higher

And now I'm sleepy
And my teepee's cold and empty
And I lost the jazz
For medicine that's in me

Oh, baby, you got the cure
You got the cure, for sure
And we're not gonna make it
Break it to me gently

Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)
Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)

I give you love
I give you everything I got
Never stop
I never tire

Now you're accusing me
Of something that I'm not
I'm no cheat
I'm no liar

And now I'm sleepy
And my teepee's cold and empty
And it's been many moons
Since you held me gently

Oh, baby, I need it bad
The feeling of what we had
Tell me what it is I did
That made you turn against me

Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)
Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)

Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby, oh
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby, oh

Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby, oh
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby, oh

Oh, my, my, my baby
We got to have a pow wow
Got to have your love tonight
So, darling, turn out the lights

Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)
Gonna have a pow wow, oh, wow
Pass the peace pipe
(Pass the peace pipe)
