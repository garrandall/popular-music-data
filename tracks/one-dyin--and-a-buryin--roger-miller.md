Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget 
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet 
It's foolproof - well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows 
Anyway, here I am walking toward where the cold dark water flows 
Cos all it takes is: 

One dying and a buryin' 
One dying and a buryin' 
Some crying 
Six carrying me 
I wanna be free 

Oh...I wanna be free 
Free from all this heartache and regret 
And free from pining for the love I can't forget 
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate 
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape 
And that's: 

One dying and a buryin' 
One dying and a buryin' 
Some cryin' 
Six carryin' me 
I wanna be free 

One dying and a buryin' 
One dying and a buryin' 
Some cryin' 
Six carryin' me 
I wanna be free
