It's late at night, nothin's feelin' right
Since you've gone away
I think I know why you left this time,
But it's still hard to say
I nearly lost it, when he came around you
Now I'm holdin' it all inside and it's killin' me

We used to meet at an old cafe in Chi-Town
At first you could hear the wind stop,
Then my heart would pound
I remember everything you used to do, girl
Now I'm learning something that you already knew

It's not the same without your love
Every night and every day, girl
It's not the same without your love
You don't have to be afraid
It's not the same without your love
Every night and every day, girl
It's not the same without your love

I saw you through the door, with your motor runnin'
I can still hear the sound
I knew then, when you asked him in, you let your guard down
You're talking soft, don't tell me,
I know you're sincere
I just called to tell you that I'm the only one here


It's not the same without your love
Every night and every day, girl
It's not the same without your love
You don't have to be afraid
It's not the same without your love
Every night and every day, girl
It's not the same without your love



It's not the same without your love
Oh, every night and every day, girl
It's not the same without your love
You don't have to be that way
It's not the same without your love
We can stop to find a way
It's not the same without your love
It's not the same without your love
Every night, every day, every night
It's not the same without your love
It's not the same without your love
It's not the same without your love
