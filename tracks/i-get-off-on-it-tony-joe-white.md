Wooh, yeah, can I ball?
You don't have to do me like that ma
Nick Cannon
You almost had me
But my inner pimp wouldn't let that happen, you dig?

Know this chick named Tanya, down form East Yonkers
Had me going honkers calm as 
Losin' my cool, let's do this straight forward
Shopping sprees in my nogamee

When them other dudes call it don't bother me
I'm a young Billy D, she Mohagany
Moto chick taught her quick how to stick and move
Bottles sip on the cris and we grip the groove

She was my friend, my homie, my one and only
Whiteys Tender, r n' b's Tenderomi
My round the way, girl, now went down the block for me
Wish she woulda told me, I'll be a 

With Ronny, Bobby, Ricky and Tony
Tryna play it pimp and pimp a player
Little momma, don't ya know I got chicks to spare
You was my first round drag on the benches over there

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Silly of me to fall in love with a chick
Puttin' dubs on a six, diamond flood on her wrist
In the club handcuffed and they huggin'
And Chinchilla furs Jakub, his and hers

Now, what you gettin' is gettin' on my nerves
Used to go out with laundry mouse to splurge
Foreign designers can't pronounce the words

Try to get you to glam alike
Ever since I bew your spot you got hammers like
Shoulda played your position like Vannah White
Never knew me and you could be man and wife

Now it's no more love, we just us
No more me and you, no more us
No more we can cruise hit the city bus
Can't believe that I fell for you
I guess it's true, gigolos get lonely too

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Yo, we used to be you, shotgun in da six hum
New Puerto Rican chick with a slick bun
I got your rum, got your rocks
Got your, oh daddy, please don't stop
I was your best thing going, now just your mail ticket
Goin' out there movin', shorty, we can still kick it

Hate to admit it, have me spendin' for a minute
If you say you didn't get it, yeah, you can still get it
You said all you want is love and affection
Used to be my angel, then you started vexin'
Took you out bough you all kinds of things
Then it got too high and burned off your wings

Up and down, the block with Dexter sayin' jock
I ain't mad at ya 'cuz the pimpin' don't stop
I hold the name of the game, my chick chose him
It's nothin' to get knocked off, I'm feelin' all slim

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Oh, I used to be in love
How could you ever do me wrong
 so low, pretty so and so
I need a maid to come and take me

Feel more slim
It's nothin' to get knocked off
Feel, knocked off
Feel more slim
It's nothin' to get knocked off
Feel more, knocked off
Feel more slim
