I met a pretty girl who really turned me on
But we didn't make it very far
It's hard to make love to a lady
When she's munching on a candy bar

And I couldn't help but say:
"Ain't no time for Milky-Way"
And she goes:
"I get off on it
I get off on it
Give just a little slack
Can't you see I'm into snacks
I get off on it"

There was a pretty thing in Los Angeles
But she was a man in women's clothes
I told him he was dressing kinda dangerous
'cause how's a fool like me gonna know

And I couldn't help but say:
"Why you wanna dress that way"
And he goes:
"I get off on it
I get off on it
Ain't no sweat off your nose
I just dig 'em ladies clothes
I get off on it"

Good old boy he met a girl and liked her
But she didn't know what he was all about
'cause when he filled his lip with tobacco
Don't you know it nearly grossed her out

And she couldn't help but say:
"Why you wanna do that way"
And he goes:
"I get off on it
I get off on it
I don't mean to make you flip
But don't be messin' with my dip
I get off on it"

There is a dude up in New York City
He wears nothing but a raincoat and he walks around
He comes up on to a lady looking pretty
And he gives her just glimpse from the waist down

And she couldn't help but say:
"Why you wanna act that way"
And he goes:
"I get off on it
I get off on it
I don't mean to bring you down
But I just gotta flash around"

There was a girl I had a lot of fun with
'Til she asked me to her house one night
And when she told me she was into bondage
Well don't you know it nearly blew my mind

And I couldn't help but say:
"Why you wanna do that way"
And she goes:
"I get off on it
I get off on it
Can't you see I'm into pain
Please let me do my thing"
