Turn on the radio
We'll play it way down low
There's a tear in your eye
That's reflecting the fire's glow
And I wish the night would never end

The sun ain't gonna be my friend
Lying here waiting and wishing
I knew when
We'll never have to say goodbye again
We'll never have to say goodbye again

You must leave
I know you will
I won't let you go until you show me
Some secret for making this time stand still

And somewhere
Sometime from now
Together again somehow
All of the waiting will seem like a moment and then
We'll never have to say goodbye again
We'll never have to say goodbye again

The whole night afraid to see the light
And the whole day crying
Wishin I knew when
We'll never have to say goodbye again
We'll never have to say goodbye again

And I wish the night would never end
The sun ain't gonna be my friend
We'll never have to say goodbye again
We'll never have to say goodbye again
