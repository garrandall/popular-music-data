Out of this world
That's where you take me
Every time you hold me
In your arms, baby love

Flowers growing in the street
Yes, the people talking sweet
Baby, baby, baby
Out of this world

Out of this world
That's where you take me
Into a world of make believe
Baby love

Where people never cry
Lovers never say goodbye
Baby, baby, baby
Out of this world

My happiness is by your side

Baby, baby, baby
Out of this, out of this world

Magic, magic, magic
Has made my dreams come true
Baby, love me, love me
You gotta let me follow you

Where people never cry
And lovers never say goodbye
Baby, baby, baby
Out of this, out of this world

Out of this world
Take me there, take me there
Baby love
