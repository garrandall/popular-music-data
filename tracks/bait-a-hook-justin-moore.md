I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, 'cause he's into bein' green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eatin' that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love,
Sounds like it sucks...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line,
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.

Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line,
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.

It won't be that long, 'til you start gettin' bored
I'll be smilin' on the river, reelin' in one more...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
Hell he don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line,
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, cause you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook
No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook
