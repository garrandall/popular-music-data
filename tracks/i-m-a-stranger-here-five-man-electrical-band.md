Well, I'm a stranger here in this place called Earth
And I was sent down here to discover the worth
Of your little blue planet, third from the sun
Come on and show me what you've done

We got the aero plane, we got the automobile
We got skyscraping buildings made of glass and steel
We've got synthetic food that nearly tastes real
And a little white pill that makes you feel
Hey! A whole lot better when you get out of bed
You take one in the morning for the long day ahead
We got everything everybody needs to survive
Surely the good life has arrived

I think your atmosphere is hurting my eyes
And your concrete mountains are blacking the skies
Now I don't say that you've been telling me lies
But why do I hear those children's cries?

I'm a stranger here, I'm just looking around

I see the aero planes carrying the bombs
Why you've even found people to drop them on
You know you can't keep what you take by force
But it's only my first impression, of course

Well, I'm a stranger here on your planet Earth

We got the rivers and the mountains and the valleys and the trees
We got the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea
We got the--

Oh, you crazy fools!
Don't you know you had it made?
You were living in paradise

But take it from one who knows
Who knows the gates of Heaven can close
I only pray that you take my advice
'Cause paradise won't come twice

Well, I'm a stranger here in this place called Earth
And I was sent down here to discover the worth
Of your little blue planet, third from the sun
I think I'll go back home where I come from

Oh, you crazy fools!
Don't you know you had it made?
You were living in paradise
