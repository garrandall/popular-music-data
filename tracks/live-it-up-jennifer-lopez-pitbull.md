From the streets of Miami
To presenting at the Grammies
Con el muslito de Jennifer
Maybe now you understand me

(clap your hands, go clap your hands
Clap your hands to the beat)

Mr Worldwide, RedOne, and the beautiful Jennifer Lopez, dale

(clap your hands, go clap your hands
Go clap your hands to the beat)

We don't believe in defeat
That's why we're back for a three-peat
Hi, Jenny, mira que esta loco
Yo me lo como como pastelito coco
I get on stupid on a beach, she wowo
I got mami, mami's by the boatload

Yo tengo la carne, y ella el mojo
I'm saying, "Dale," she's screaming, "YOLO!"
She's Little Red Riding Hood,
And guess who's the lobo? Me la como

Whose name is globally known
Whose name's on a check, and they adding an O
Whose name is on the Blimp with the world is yours
Whose name is on schools, huh
Slam for sure

I know it's hard to understand
How a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand
But guess what? Here I am
Jenny from the block. Let's rock

You push me harder, I do the same
Boy, I wanna feel you in every way
Don't even wonder. It's just a game
We're rocking body-to-body. Let's go insane

I hit the spotlight
All night
Ready to go
Give you a hard night
So tight
Ready to blow
Sure

I'm in the spotlight
All night
Ready to go
Give you a hard night
So tight
Ready to blow

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go

(make love, don't fight
Let's fook tonight
Let's fook tonight)

Turn up this motherâ and let it play
(mami)
I know you like my bumper
Don't be ashamed
(que rico)
Don't even wonder. It's just a game
(mami)
We're rocking body-to-body. Let's go insane
(que rico)

I hit the spotlight
All night
Ready to go
Give you a hard night
So tight
Ready to blow
Sure you do

I'm in the spotlight
All night
Ready to go
Give you a hard night
So tight
Ready to blow

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go

(make love, don't fight
Let's fook tonight
Let's fook tonight)

You name it. She's done it
She's the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me

(clap your hands, go clap your hands
Go clap your hands to the beat)
(clap your hands, go clap your hands
Go clap your hands to the beat)
(clap your hands, go clap your hands
Go clap your hands to the beat)

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up. So, live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go

(let's fook tonight
Let's fook tonight)
