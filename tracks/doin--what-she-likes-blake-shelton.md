She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes

She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rearview mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doin' what she likes

And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwin' words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doin' what she likes
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

Yeah, I like doin' what she likes
Hmm, yeah
