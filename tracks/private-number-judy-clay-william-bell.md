Since I've been gone
You've had your number changed
But my love for you, girl
Still remains the same

Now I've been loving you
And you've been loving me
So long, baby, what's wrong

So I'm asking baby, baby, baby
Please let me have your number, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Please let me have your number

I'm sorry you couldn't call me
When you got home
But other fellows kept on calling
While you were gone

So I had the number changed
But I'm not acting strange
Welcome home, nothing's wrong

So I'm saying, baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number
Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number

Oh, thank you

Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number
Thank you, baby
Baby, baby, baby
For giving me your private number
You can have it
Thank you, baby

(Baby, baby, baby)
You can have it
Thank you, baby
Anytime you want it
Thank you, baby
You can have my private number
