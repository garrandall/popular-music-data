Everybody's startin' to pick on you
Just can't let them tell you what to do
You've only got one life, so live it cool
In this world of strife, you can't be a fool

Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge, and your jury too
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
Gotta be your judge and jury too

All right

Gotta do your thing, and let it all hang out
Gotta really show them, what it's all about
Move on up, don't look around
People will always try to put you down, down, now

Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge, and your jury too
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
Gotta be your judge and jury too

Woooo!

What you wanna
What you wanna
Yeah, yeah
(Do what you wanna do)
Oh yeah
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do
(Do what you wanna do)
I'm gonna do, yeah
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
I'm gonna do
(Do what you wanna do)
Yeah, yeah
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
I'm gonna do, yeah
(Do what you wanna do)
I don't want to hurt nobody
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
I don't want to hurt nobody
(Do what you wanna do)
I don't want to hurt nobody
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
Just got to do my thing, now
(Do what you wanna do)
Gotta do, gotta do, gotta do
(Be the judge and the jury, too)
(Do what you wanna do)

(Do what you wanna do)
(Do what you wanna do)
(Do what you wanna do)
(Do what you wanna do)
