My brain is taking in too much pain
I'm bout to explode first, and then take names
But it's cool lil' shawty don't be so alarmed
I learned to buck nigga when I jabbed in the arm
I don't play wit mutherfuckers cause the shit be real
Make you hold your breath longer than the Navy Seal
And them bows gon' leave you ass dead in the past
Ain't no way you can differ your dick from your ass
I drop bows wit my nigga (what)
Fuck hoes wit my nigga (what)
How the fuck you think I feel about this arm in your figure
It's a closed casket for them hatin' bastards
It's some G's that's real, it's a mess of faggots
Who you talkin' to bitch, what you gon' do trick
When it's obvious to see that you ain't gon' do shit
Lil Scrappy the prince and I ain't takin' no junk
I'm a quiet crunk nigga and fuck being a punk


If you fall up in the club
And them niggas wanna mug
When you step up to they face
What they gon' do (Shit!)
If you fall up in the club
And them hoes start acting up
