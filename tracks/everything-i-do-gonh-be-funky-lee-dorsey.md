Everything I do gohn be funky

Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on

I have to be myself and do my thing
A little soul can't do no harm, yeah
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah

Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah

Some may say I've got no class
But I'm doing what I wanna do
So go with me if you can
Or just do what you can do

Oh, shucks
Why you whining
I'm on fire
Yeah, everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on

Never before have I felt so good
Just being natural me
My little hang up and my little times
But deep inside, I'm free

Let your hair down, get down wings
Who's to say what's right or wrong
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on

Yeah, everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on, yeah

Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on
Everything I do gohn be
Funky from now on

Oh, shucks, do your thing
