At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never
Live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and
I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
Hey hey
It took all the strength
I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now
I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up
Little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
Oh, now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
I will survive
