And when I spend my hours looking at your window
And when I see you pass by
I begin to feel you near me
Still I know that you won't hear me
Won't you love me
Don't you need me
Can't you see me cry
And as I watch you draw your shade when night is falling
I want to call your name and blame you
For the wasted days
I can't see you through the haze
Won't you love me
Don't you need me
Can't you see me cry
Would you remember me
If I asked for the name of someone
Who loves you
Or would you answer that you don't know
But I look familiar
Who loves you
Who loves you
So if you see me standing here beneath your window
And if it's getting late
Remember that I'll wait for you
And watch until my life is through
Won't you love me
Don't you need me
Can't you see me cry
Can't you see me cry
Can't you see me cry
