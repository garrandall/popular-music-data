Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them goin' crazy
And up here so am I
Thinkin' about you sittin' there sayin' I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand livin' here why'd you take it, take it

Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown

All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beatin' me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
