Shorty been eyein' me
She lookin' like she thinkin' 'bout tryin' me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm bout to take her to my spot
I'm a get it hot, she gonna turn around and let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I am tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a tear it up


Excuse me miss but sexy can I
Take you to my crib
Make love on my piano
Yea you know me lil' shorty from Atlanta
I wanna do some things to you
Touch your body make you get naughty
Say my name when I beep, beep, beep
We can do it in the pool or the jeep, jeep, jeep
'Cause girl you know your turnin' me on


Shorty been eyein' me
She lookin' like she thinkin' 'bout tryin' me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm 'bout to take her to my spot
I'm a get it hot, she gonna turn around and let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I am tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a tear it up


Got a pole in my condo
I can make it rain
Now make you clap for me
You drivin' me crazy
I know you want me cause I want you girl
Tell me can we get it on tonight
Lights camera action I'll play director
Turn you out let me sneak a peak
Turn you out on the late night creep
Ain't playin no games tonight


Shorty been eyein' me
She lookin' like she thinkin' 'bout tryin' me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm 'bout to take her to my spot
I'm a get it hot, she gonna turn around and let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I am tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a tear it up


I can tell the way she watchin' me
She love the way I swag out
Got enough to go around
Might as well pass it out
She said she like the way I work her out till she passin' out
Wanna be with a star well mama I'm a astronaut
Let her lick the wrapper I call that the jaw breaker
If her back was the law then call me a law breaker
Love the way she roll her hips
Is like she on the bean shoppin'
Make her lose her boy just like she on the scream machine
She said my Cavalli cologne be turnin' her on
And she a fiend because my black snake be makin' her moan
Like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
All night we gon' freak, freak, freak, freak, freak


Shorty been eyein' me
She lookin' like she thinkin' 'bout tryin' me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm 'bout to take her to my spot
I'm a get it hot, she gonna turn around and let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I am tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a tear it up


I'm a do it just like that
I'm a do it just like that
