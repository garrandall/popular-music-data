I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch
Day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk

I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

You don't know
Just what you got
Till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot
But it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name

It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
(Goodbye)

He's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night

Oh, I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
(Got a man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

Baby
(Please listen to me baby)
You've got a man on your mind
(Gotta get that man off your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

Baby
(Oh, baby baby baby)
You've got a man on your mind
(You got that man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye
