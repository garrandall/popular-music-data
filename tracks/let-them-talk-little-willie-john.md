 baby
Ay yo Sneed
You know I was thinking about running for mayor out here
You know I'd do it
(Hey!)

I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
I'm a mid Ten hustler with a true south swagger
Hillbilly balling, counting money on my tractor
With my John Deere fiddy cap made in the shade
And my throwback bravo boots stomping your way
Got the game rap tight like some square bale hay
I can pull 'em fresh hit the block and get paid
I own 32 acres of a dream come true
Bout a 100 head of cattle and a fishing hole too
Shit, I ain't hard to find, I be doing what I do
Out push hogging fields smoking on that berry blue
Living my life like an old dirt road
Sipping poke-brown out the jug, keep me ice cold
I'm a small town boy with some big city dreams
Let me drop a little something just to show you what I mean

I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
King of, king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix

(Tell 'em Sneed)
I'm drinking shine, berry kush, let the lighters spark
It's Mr. Sneed, keep 'em bouncing in they trailer parks
That white boy has switched the game up the south part
I'm representing for them hard heads and outlaws
We're John Deere drivers, we sticky green pickers
We running from the smokeys and they ain't gon' catch us
So I'ma keep it moving and get her done right
For my good ol' boys on their porches with them Bud Lights
Six shooters, two shots when he stepped to me
I shot the sheriff but I didn't shoot the deputy
I'm getting money buddy but y'all can stay broke
My Ford pickup got more horses than a stage coach
From the stix, tell ya what, put the bricks up
Talking loud'll get you dumped off in that pickup
This Tennessee sun ain't got my ass melting
Plus I called up Big Smo 'cause he smoke like Willie 

I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
King of, king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix

Ay yo Sneed, let me slide through with my F100
Sipping on poke-brown, smoking on something
Sneaky as a hundred 
I'm going off that green and buzzed off that wine
It's just another day in this country boy's life
Hit the farm in the morning, get it popping at night
From the stix to the bricks, from the green to the white
I can bout guarantee ya we can get your mind right
Hey yo Smo, pass the jug, boy, pass around the cup
We smoking on the sticky, now we fishing on the pond
Speak another  did I tell you that I got 'em
Concrete boots ain't throw no fish on the bottom
We don't pick up driving shotgun  motherfuckers
We treat you like iPhone, you talking we gon' touch you
Them real ratty boys, huh, we up to no good
We the realest in the game from the hood to the woods

Yeah, they know who the boss is
