Let them talk if they want to
Talk don't bother me
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

Let them whisper
For they know not what's
Between you and I
I'll keep on loving you
Until the day I die

They're tryin' to breakup our romance
But they don't have a chance
We have the kind of love
That's so strong
We'll be together from now on

Idle gossip comes from the devil's workshop
But true love will make it stop
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

They're envious of ev'rything we do
But it's so wonderful (wonderful)
When you love some one (love someone)
When that someone loves you
