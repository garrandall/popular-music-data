Sun stuck high in the air
Destination anywhere this road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
And as my mind drifts off to sleep

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare, in your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight, in the moonlight
The way you're lookin' at me with your lovin' eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You will always be my only girl
But that's another place in time, back when you were mine
In another world

A car stops way up ahead
I climb inside, her hair is red, I thank her for the ride
She talks the miles away
I nod and smile and try to say anything to be polite
But as the darkness ends the day
Another voice whispers my name

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare, in your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight, in the moonlight
The way you're lookin' at me with your lovin' eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You will always be my only girl
But that's another place in time, back when you were mine
In another world

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare, in your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight, in the moonlight
The way you're lookin' at me with your lovin' eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You will always be my only girl
But that's another place in time, back when you were mine
In another world
In another world
In another world
