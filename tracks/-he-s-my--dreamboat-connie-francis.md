He's my dreamboat, asleep in English class
He's my dreamboat, mowin' his folk's grass
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes

He's my dreamboat, workin' on his car
He's my dreamboat, strummin' his guitar
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes

Well now, I dream of dreamboat in everything I do
And I know that darlin' dreamboat dreams of me too

He's my dreamboat, coffee in a Dixie cup
Darlin' dreamboat, that crazy, silly nut
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes

Yes, he's my dreamboat, coffee in a Dixie cup
Whoa, darlin' dreamboat, that crazy, silly nut
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes
