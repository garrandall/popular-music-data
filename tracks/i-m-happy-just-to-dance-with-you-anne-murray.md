I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Whoa, is everything I know
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see her face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Whoa, is everything I know
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see her face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance
Happy just to dance
Happy just to dance with you
