You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

It's late night and I'm thinkin' of some thick thighs to get in
Sittin' by the phone for a call for the weekend
Phone rings maybe it's some cut on the late tip
Tryna get my jimmy wet from her tongue and her lips
So I picked up (hello) What's up who could this be
(Baby it's? a real freak out of zone 3)
What's really good in the hood with your fine ass
I'm tryin grip ass and pull hair from the back fast
Won't you come over so we can get this thing poppin'
Cause when you hit the door only thing is panties droppin'
So fuck with ya boy cause I'm right down in trill town
Things could be better if you bring through some more crown

Oh, oh
You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

When I stepped up to her hey I knew it was on
She said she had a man but he was at home
But she still put her number yep in my phone
Told me to give her a call when I got home
When I called her I told her like this
I don't want to be your man but we can be cut friends
So come on over I got it all laid out
We can have a couple of drinks and freak all over the house
When she came to the door I already knew it was her
Knock knock come on in I'm just?
I like your outfit baby but lose that shirt
Lose that shirt toss that bra throw those draws
Before you knew it we were freakin' in the hall
Nice round ass I was grippin' it all
I like the way she threw me up against the wall
Then went down on me start lickin' my balls
I'm like this is how life should be, it's goin' down
She got her legs wide I'm inside she's screamin' out while I suck them thick thighs
I'm about to skeet?
Baby turn around
Let Don P take you to trill town

Oh, oh
You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

Lookin' at you got me wantin' to do somethin' freaky to ya
Say you need a nigga in ya life to keep it kinky for ya
Cause all you gotta do is keep it G and I'll give it to ya
Come through in the middle of the night and I'll be here for ya
Just relax let me free your mind and take you out of space
And if we got on clothes then after that then we out of place
Where you tryna go, let me know
What's your fantasy
Is it on the beach or on top of the balcony
Shawty you can ride with me
Roll it up get high with me
And when it's time to go to war you ain't scared to die for me
Spread your wings and fly with me
Go for cop a high with me
I know it's kind of late but damn baby come on vibe for me

Oh, oh
You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town

You can be my cutty cutty buddy,
Fo' sho' you can ride with me
Girl don't act like you don't already know,
Act like you don't see
We can get it on the bed or the floor,
Don't matter to me girl
I'm gonna take you to trill town
