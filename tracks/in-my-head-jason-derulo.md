C'mon, yeah


Everybody's looking for love, oh (woo, huh)
Ain't that the reason you're at this club? Oh (huh)
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no (no)
I've got a better solution for you, girl, oh (huh)


Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down


In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, yeah
In my head, oh, yeah, c'mon


Some dudes know all the right things to say, ayy (ayy, uh)
When it comes down to it, it's all just game said
Instead of talking, let me demonstrate, yeah (yeah)
Get down to business and skip foreplay (foreplay, ayy, yeah)


Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (we can go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known (never known)
I can see it going down, going down


In my head, I see you all over me (baby, all over me)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (fulfill my fantasy)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head


Break it down (ayo, ayo), c'mon on, let's go (ayo)
You're singing to me, baby, in my head right now
(Ayo, ayo), c'mon, yeah (ayo, ayo)
She'll be screaming out when it all goes down


Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known (never known)
I can see it going down, going down


In my head, I see you all over me (head)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (head)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (head, oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, I see you all over me (all over you)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (you do, baby)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud (oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down (in my head)
In my head, it's going down
It's going down in my head
