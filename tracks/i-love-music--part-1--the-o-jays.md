Ah, ah, ah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Ohhh, oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, oh, oh
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, yeah
Ohhh, oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, oh, oh

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving

Makes me laugh, makes me smile all the while
Whenever I'm with you, girl
While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do
Oh, ohohohw, aw, aw, aw, aw

Ohhh, oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, oh, oh

I love music
Sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing

I'm so happy to be in complete harmony
I love you, girl
And to hold you so close in my arms
I'm so glad that you're mine, all mine

Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet, so sweet
So mellow, mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arms
Oh, honey I love you, I love you, yeah
Music is the hearing force of the world
It's understood by every man, woman, boy and girl
And that's why, that's why I say (That's why, that's why)

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving, grooving

Music makes the atmosphere so fine
Lights down low, just me and you, baby you know
'Specially when you got a cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song

I love music
Any, any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving

And I say I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Sweet, sweet music. (Keep it grooving.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Listen, listen, listen
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music, music
(Sweet music, sweet music.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Funky, funky music
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Boogie, boogie. (Groovy, ohohohoovy now.) Boogie
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
(We can dance all night long now.)
Any, any, any kind of music, music
I love, I love music, music. I love. (Sweet, sweet music.)
Na, na, na, na, na, na. (Ah, ah, ah, ah.)
No, no, no, yeah, yeah. (Keep it grooving.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music

(Instrumental break)

Come on. (Get it on.) Get it on
Come on, come on. Get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
(Get on down.) Get it on
Come on, come on, come on, get it on
(Groovy, groovy, groovy sound.)
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Funky, funky music
Ohhh, oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, oh, oh
Groove
Ohhh, oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, oh, oh

I said I love, I love, I love, I love, I love mu-mu-music
Music, music. (Real good music.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music. Yeah, yeah
(Keep it grooving.)
I love music, (Sweet, sweet music.)
Any, any kind of music. Yeah, yeah. (Groovy music.)
I love music just as long as it's grooving
(Oh, baby, turn me on. Funky.)
(I love music.) I'm so happy to be in complete harmony. (Sweet)
I'm loving you, girl. (Sweet music.) You got the music
(Groovy.) I love music
You got the music
I say now (I love music.) I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
Get it on, yeah. Put it on, yeah, yeah
( I love music.) Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
No, no, no, no, no, no
Grooving with you, darling. (I love music.)
Love you
