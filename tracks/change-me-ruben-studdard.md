How would you like it if I talked about your skin
The way you wear your hair (oh, girl)
Would you like if I talked about your butt or once a month
Turned into someone that was hard to love

How would you like it if I didn't like your smoke
Didn't like your polish you be wearing on your toes
If I didn't like your neck-a-lace or what you cooked for breakfast
Would I be wrong, would I be wrong

Why you wanna change me
Flip all the thangs that really make me the way that I am
Used to make you happy, baby, why you wanna change me
You used to like your big old teddy bear
You used to let me get it anywhere
Now, baby, it's crazy
Why, why, why you wanna change me

Now what if all I did was pick apart
Your friends cause they ain't got no ends
What if I talked about your face in the morning
Cause we know that you ain't cute in the morning
What if I criticized the way that you be eating
And when you sleeping
You be doing that heavy breathing
What if I was at or about your house creeping
Would I be wrong, would I be wrong

Why you wanna change me
Flip all the thangs that really make me the way that I am
Used to make you happy, baby, why you wanna change me
You used to like your big old teddy bear
You used to let me get it anywhere
Now, baby, it's crazy
Why, why, why you wanna change me

We used to love breaking up
Knowing well be together again
And we used to love the arguments
Cause we making love by the end, girl
How you gonna change everything in return
Cause I don't wanna go if it ain't gonna be the same
If it ain't broke then why you wanna change

Why you wanna change me
Flip all the thangs that really make me the way that I am
Used to make you happy, baby, why you wanna change me
You used to like your big old teddy bear
You used to let me get it anywhere
Now, baby, it's crazy
Why, why, why you wanna change me

Tell me why you wanna change
Why, why, why you wanna change me
Why you wanna change me
Why baby, tell me why, girl, why
Baby, tell me why you wanna change me
Why you wanna change me
Why, baby, tell me why, girl
Baby, tell me why
Why you wanna change me
Why you wanna change me
Why, baby, tell me why
Baby, tell me why
Girl, why
