Used to want to fuck on iCarly
Like my government name really Nevel
I think that pussy hot as a kettle
She would describe my dick as a shovel
Ask me one question 'what does my heaven resemble'
And I say me overdosing out in a meadow
Ask me one question 'what does my heaven resemble'
And I say you might need a fuckin' stretcher

Eenie meenie miney mo
There's no wind like where's the blow
Lucky charms up on my neck wit no rainbow or pot o' gold
Eenie meenie miney mo (water!)
There's no wind like where's the blow
Lucky charms up on my neck wit no rainbow or pot o' gold
(my back!)

Thot pocket, kiss my rocket no mistletoe (suck it!)
Wait, then my dick fire make you wanna duck n' roll
45, 47, 50, 60 sold
It might not be backpage but thats how I sell yo' hoe
Aye like when she suck my dick I hope she rage
Straight for the balls like that girl Johnny Cage (nasty bitch!)
Kung-fu Panda shorts wit the Po
Hit the fuckin chicken noodle soup wit the pole
(I don't have a whip)

Used to want to fuck on iCarly

Ask me one question 'what does my heaven resemble'
And I say me overdosing out in a meadow
Ask me one question 'what does my heaven resemble'
And I say me overdosing out in a meadow

Okay like bimbo
When a ball up in kinda tight and hard to fit in Kimbo slice playing limbo
Jump rope (jump rope) how I stomp and spit it puss in boots cause you a kitty
Whip his ass like Django
King kong (king kong)
Got that white girl with me
You a mouse just like you Mickey
Clubhouse is where you belong
Ten-four
Run around the lobby like I'm London Tipton
Put some diamonds on my pinky toe

Eenie meenie miney mo
There's no wind like where's the blow
Lucky charms up on my neck wit no rainbow or pot o' gold
Eenie meenie miney mo
There's no wind like where's the blow
Lucky charms up on my neck wit no rainbow or pot o' gold

Cluck cluck, cluck cluck chicken
That is niggas when they see me turn to Forrest Gump
Cause niggas start to buck buck
Duck duck, duck duck goose
When I hit it with the penis man I love it when she run run, run run
Clean like some Listerine
Ima round demons like Constantine
This little bitch must be off a bean
Get that bitch wetter than Dawson's Creek
Okay like this bitch must be off a bean
Hit a stain on her just like Mr. Clean
This bitch must be off a bean
Hit a stain on her just like Mr. Clean
This bitch must be off a bean
Hit a stain on her just like Mr. Clean
This bitch must be off a bean
Hit a stain on her just like Mr. Clean

Psycho, psycho 
Designer straitjackets
Psycho, psycho 
Designer straitjackets
Water, water
Ski Mask the Pump God
