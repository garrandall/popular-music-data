Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...

He gets me in the dark, and he says he's my man
But when we walk down the street, he never holds my hand...
He say one day that he will marry me
But he tells his friends that that will never be...

Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)

When we go to a dance, I have to go in alone
But he always catches me before I get home
Then he wants to hug and kiss on me;
Everybody's sleepin', and no one can see...

Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)

Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...
(Yeah-yeah! Uh-huh!)
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
(Yeah-yeah! Uh-huh!)

I saw him kissing some girl he said was his friend
And before the night was over, he was doin' it again;
He said one day that I would be his wife
But he wants me to wait for the rest of my life...

Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh...
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh...
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
(I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do!)
