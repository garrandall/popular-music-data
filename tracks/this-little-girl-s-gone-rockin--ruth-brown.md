I wrote my mom a letter and this is what I said...

Wella wella wella wella

Washed all the dishes and I did a lot more

I even bought the dinner at the grocery store

And now, mom, you'll find the key next door

This little girl's gone rockin'

I left some biscuits for the pup

I put fresh water in his cup

And now I'm off, I'm gonna live it up

This little girl's gone rockin'

Well, i'll be home about twelve tonight

And not a minute minute minute later

Don't forget the front door light

That's all for now, i'll see you later, mater

You'll find each thing that you wanted done

I'm off to meet that special one

And boy oh boy will we have fun

'cause this little girl's gone rockin'
