Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been

Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine

Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anythin' you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowin' every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into somethin' bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight

Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy king

Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anythin' you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

The truth is that I'm askin' you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
I still need you

Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth
