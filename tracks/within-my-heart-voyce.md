When I look into your eyes
It's hard to realize
The way we used to be
Why did you set me free
I gave you all my love
With the hope that we would be
A passion that would last
Through all eternity

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

You are always on my mind
And I hope to someday find
A love that we once shared
Can't you see I really care
You know I need you now
And I have to find out how
We would ever be
Baby you and me

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

Being with you girl
Is all that matters
I once had a dream girl
And now it's shattered
'Cause you went your way
And I went mine
Girl I will always love you

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

Within my heart
I wanted you to stay
Within my heart
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay

Within my heart
I don't know what to do
Within my heart
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Within my heart
Why did it have to be this way
'Cause within my heart
I always wanted you to stay
