Every time my baby and I have a quarrel,
I swear I won't give in.
Then my baby starts to smile at me,
And I know, I know I just can't win.

When my little girl is smiling
There's nothing more I can say.
I see those big bright eyes
And then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way

When my little girl is smiling
I can't stay mad at her for long.
Why should I want to fight
When I can hold her tight?
I just don't care who's right or wrong.

When my little girl is smiling
It's the greatest thrill there can be.
She gets her way it's true,
But I know I won't be blue
As long as she just smiles for me.
