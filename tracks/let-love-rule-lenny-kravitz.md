Love is gentle as a rose 
And love can conquer any war 
It's time to take a stand 
Brothers and sisters join hands 

We got to let love rule 
Let love rule 
We got to let love rule 
Let love rule 

Love transcends all space and time 
And love can make a little child smile 
Oh can't you see 
This won't go wrong 
But we got to be strong 
We can't do it alone 

We got to let love rule 
Let love rule 
We got to let love rule
