I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost
I can let go


I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes


I just fell
Don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes


I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
Oh it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes
