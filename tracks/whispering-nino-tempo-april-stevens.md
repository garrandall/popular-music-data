Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
Oh, I know it's true
There's no one, dear, but you

Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you

Whispering while you cuddle near me
(Whispering while you cuddle near me)
Whispering so no one can hear me
(Whispering so no one can hear me)
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
(Each little whisper seems to cheer me)

I know it's true
(Oh, I know it's true)
There's no one, dear, but you
(There's no one, dear, but you)

Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you
Whispering that I love you
