Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
Go on, go on
Just walk away
Go on, go on
Your choice is made
Go on, go on
And disappear
Go on, go on
Away from here


And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
Inbetween without you
Without you


Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
Why can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me


And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me
And be her in between
Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you
