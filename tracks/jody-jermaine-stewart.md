Everybody wants Jody
Everybody wants Jo-DAY! Ha!
Everybody wants you, girl

Ha!

Everybody wants you, baby!

Oww!

Tigers on the left, sharks on the right
Green-eyed devils burning in the night
She don't need protection, she don't have to fight
She just tried to listen, said she might
You can't explain it
Makes you weak, make your body freak, ha!
You can't contain it (No)
What she's got, man, it's much too hot!

Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake (Yeah)
Everybody wants some of Jody (Jody)
All the love they can take (Oh...)
Everybody wants a piece of Jody (Whoo!)
Wants a taste of the cake (Yeah)
Everybody wants some of Jody (Jody, Jody)
All the love they can take
Ow...Jody!

The way she moves her hips, it cannot be denied
She says she's gonna love you till you're dry
Your world is spinnin' 'round when you close your eyes
You'll think you must be learning how to fly
It must be voodoo
How she got you wild, walking through the fire
When she gets to you
You could lose your mind, 'cause she's so damn fine!

Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake
Everybody wants (yeah) some of Jody (Yeah, oh, Jody)
All the love they can take (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake (Mmm-hm, yeah)
Everybody wants some of Jody (Jody)
All the love they can take (Oh...)

Whoa, yeah!

Jody!
Jody, Jody
(Oh, yaw, yaw, yaw)

Jody, Jody
(Oh, yeah!)
(Hee-ee-ee-ee-ee)
Everybody wants you, baby

Jody, Jody

Work, work! Work, work!
(Jody, Jody)
Work, work! Work, work!

Work, work! Work, work!
(Jody, Jody)
Work, work! Work, work!
Ow!

You can't explain it (No)
Makes you weak, make your body freak, ha!
You can't contain it (No)
What she's got, man, it's much too hot!

Everybody wants a piece of Jody (Jody, baby)
Wants a taste of the cake (oh, yeah)
Everybody wants some of Jody
All the love they can take
(Everybody wants her)

Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake (All they want)
Everybody wants some of Jody
All the love they can take
(Everybody wants)

Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake
(They've got to have)
Everybody wants some of Jody (Yeah, yeah, oh, Jody)
All the love they can take
(Everybody wants you, baby)

Everybody wants a piece of Jody
Wants a taste of the cake
(Everybody, everyone)
Everybody wants some of Jody (Oh, oh)
All the love they can take
(They want the icing on the cake!)

Everybody wants a piece of Jody (Jody)
Wants a taste of the cake (Oh!)
Everybody wants...
