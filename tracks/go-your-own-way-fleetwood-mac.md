Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I, when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

Tell me why everything turned around?
Cause packing up, shacking up, is all you wanna do
If I could baby I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you 

You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way

DO IT!!

(yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go!)

You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day (Another lonely day)
You can go your own way (go your own way!)
