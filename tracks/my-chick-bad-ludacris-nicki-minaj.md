My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could

My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours


I'm saying my chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My chick do stuff that I can't even put in words

Her swagger don't stop
Her body won't quit
So fool pipe down you ain't talking bout shit

My chick bad, tell me if you seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena

All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body looking like milk
No time for games, she's full-grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home

My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could

My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours


Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
I knock a bitch out and fight
Coming out swinging like Tiger Woods' wife

Yeah she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up their chests like pasties
Couple girlfriends and they all a little crazy
Coming down the street like a parade Macy's

I fill her up balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
Doh, but I ain't talking bout homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her

My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could
My chick bad
And I love her
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could

My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours
Let's go


Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty
Running down the court I'm dunking on em Lisa Leslie

It's going down, basement
Friday the 13th guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
It's nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playing Freddy

(My chick bad)

Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy
The Mental Asylum looking for me
You a rookie to me
I'm in that wam bam purple Lam'
Damn bitch you been a fan

My chick bad
 don't get scared now
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could
 Disturbing the peace
My chick bad
 what
My chick hood
 what
My chick do stuff that ya chick wish she could

 let's go

My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours
Luda

And when we all alone
I might just tip her
She slides down the pole
Like a certified stripper

And when we all alone
I might just tip her
She slides down the pole
Like a certified stripper

And when we all alone
I might just tip her
She slides down the pole
Like a certified stripper
