Pretty smile lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady
You're my no tell lover
Every night in a different place I'll meet you tender lady
You're my no tell lover
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming, even if it's you I'm lovin'
Every minute is an hour every day's a lonely lifetime
You're my no tell lover
The little time that we spend together just can't last forever
You're my no tell lover
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
There's nothing left to say
I want her
I can't leave her
Pretty smile, lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady
You're my no tell lover
Every night in a different place I'll need you tender lady
You're my no tell lover
Everyone keeps tellin' me this affair's not meant to be
Even though I need you night and day
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'
I want her
I can't leave her
I won't live without her
She's my no tell lover
