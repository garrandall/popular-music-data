I would walk home every evening
Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself from silence
Wash it down with empty nights

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Now, I walk home every evening
And my feet are quick to move
'Cause I know my destination
Is a warm and waiting you

From our first communication
It was clear
Any thought of moderation
Would soon disappear

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
No, it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
