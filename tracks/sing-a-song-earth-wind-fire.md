When you feel down and out
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
For you, it's the time to shout
Sing a song (it'll make a way)
Sometimes it's hard to care
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
A smile so hard to bear
Sing a song (it'll make a way)


Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song


Bring your heart to believing
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
Life ain't about no retrieving
Oh yeah (it'll make a way)
Give yourself what you need
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
Smile, smile, smile and believe
Sing a song (it'll make a way)


Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song


?


Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song


If you sing a song a day
You will make a better way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh huh
