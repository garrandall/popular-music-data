The name game!
Shirley!
Shirley, Shirley bo Birley Bonana fanna fo Firley

Fee fy mo Mirley, Shirley!
Lincoln!
Lincoln, Lincoln bo Bincoln Bonana fanna fo Fincoln

Fee fy mo Mincoln, Lincoln!
Come on everybody!
I say now let's play a game
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there
But a B or an F or an M will appear
And then I say bo add a B then I say the name and Bonana fanna and a
Fo
And then I say the name again with an F very plain
And a fee fy and a mo
And then I say the name again with an M this time

And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme
Arnold!
Arnold, Arnold bo Barnold Bonana fanna fo Farnold

Fee fy mo Marnold Arnold!
But if the first two letters are ever the same
I drop them both and say the name like
Bob, Bob drop the B's Bo ob
For Fred, Fred drop the F's Fo red
For Mary, Mary drop the M's Mo ary

That's the only rule that is contrary.
Okay? Now say Bo: Bo
Now Tony with a B: Bony
Then Bonana fanna fo: bonana fanna fo
Then you say the name again with an F very plain: Fony
Then a fee fy and a mo: fee fy mo
Then you say the name again with an M this time: Mony

And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme
Say Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney
Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fo-ney
Fee fi mo-mo-ney, Tony!
Let's do Billy!
Billy, Billy, bo-gil-ly, bo-na-na
Fanna, fo-fil-ly
Fee fi mo-mil-ly, Billy!
Let's do Marsha!
Marsha, Marsha, bo-bar-sha
Bo-na-na fanna, fo-far-sha
Fee fi mo-ar-sha, Marsha!
Little trick with Nick!
Nick, Nick, bo-bick, bo-na-na
Fanna fo fick, fee fi mo-mick. Nick!
The name game.
