Hey, there's a postcard here,
From, uh, from Jamaica

Footsteps on the stairway
Bringing something my way

Postcard from Jamaica
Suggesting that I take a trip
See someone I long to see somewhere

Postcard full of sunshine
Telling me that she's mine

Postcard from Jamaica
Suggesting that I take a trip
See a girl who has been sent away

She didn't want to go
Mothers rarely know
When to hang on
And when they should let go

Postcard from Jamaica
Suggesting that I take a trip
See someone who has to go away

Gonna see my girl
I may go 'round the world

Got to get there somehow
Want to kiss her right now

Postcard from Jamaica
Suggesting that I take a trip
To love someone I know still loves me too

Yes I'm gonna go
Postcard senders know
Places that I really want to be

Postcard from Jamaica
Suggesting that I take a trip
To see someone (to see someone)
To see someone (to see someone)
(To see someone)
I wanna see my girl
May go 'round the world
(To see someone)
