Here he comes
The boy I'll always love
He's the one
That I've been dreaming of
He's my pride
He's my joy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy

Other girls
Watch us walking by
Bet they wish
Jimmy was their guy
He's my pride
He's my joy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy

It seems my love for him gets stronger each day
And I keep waiting for the time when I will hear him say:
"Do you know
I want to marry you?
'Cause inside
I know our love is true"

He's my pride
He's my joy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy



He's my pride
He's my joy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy
He's my one and only Jimmy boy (Jimmy boy, Jimmy boy)
He's my one and only Jimmy boy...
