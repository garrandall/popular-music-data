I would lock you up
But I could not bear to hear you
Screaming to be set free
I would chain you up
If I'd thought you'd swear
The only one that mattered was me, me, me
I would strap you up
But don't worry baby
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to

It's too late to stop
Won't the heavens save me?
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you

You take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide you baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
When the passion dies -
It's just a matter of time before my heart is
Looking for a home

I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day
I'm like a doggie barking at your door
So come take me back to the place you stay
And maybe we can do it once more

You say I'm dangerous
But don't worry baby
I get excited at the things that you do
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie
'Cos no-one does it better than me and you

You take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Please don't tell me lies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is
Looking for a home

I ain't got no more worries
I'm gonna spend some times with you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that I know it

You take me to the edge of heaven
You tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...
You take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby
One day you'll wake up on your own.

I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
Everyone's got their eyes on you
I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that I know it
