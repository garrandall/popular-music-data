Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?


'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving


Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year"
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go


'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving


People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh
There are no holes in his shoes
But a big hole in his world, yeah
Maybe I'll get famous
As the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to
But you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved


'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (oh, where on Earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet, oh, oh)
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street)


'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (so I'm not moving)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (I'm not moving)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (I'm not moving)
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street (I'm not moving)


Going back to the corner
Where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag
I'm not gonna move
