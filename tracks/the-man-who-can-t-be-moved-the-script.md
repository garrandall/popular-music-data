Going back to the corner
Where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag
I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard
Got your picture in my hand
Saying:

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find a time
I've got a new job now in the umemploymentline
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess it's a gods test
Someone help us cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

Cos if one day you wake up
And find that your missing me
And your heart starts to wonder
Where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here
To the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you
On the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

She's in line at the door with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
Policeman says: Son you cant stay here
I say: There's someone I'm waiting for if its a day -a month -a year
Gotta stand my ground
Even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind
This is the first place she will go

Cause we're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who cant be moved
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'd come running to the corner
Cos you'll know its just for you
I'm the man who cant be moved
I'm the man who cant be moved

If one day you wake up
And find that your missing me
And your heart starts to wonder
Where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'd come back here
To the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you
On the corner of the street so

I'm not moving (Oh these times are hard, Yeah they're making us crazy, Don't give up on me baby)
I'm not moving
I'm not moving (Oh these times are hard, Yeah they're making us crazy, Don't give up on me baby)
I'm not moving
Oh these times are hard, Yeah they're making us crazy, Don't give up on me baby (I'm the man who can't be moved, I'm the man who can't be moved)
Oh these times are hard, Yeah they're making us crazy, Don't give up on me baby (I'm the man, I'm not moving)
