Every day I sit beside you
On the bus to Madison Avenue
Work in the big gray store
With the revolving doors

You don't even know my name
I guess that I'm to blame
Don't know the right things to say
So I pretend away

That I'm Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you

Today I'm done with games (today I'm done with games)
Gonna ask you for your name
Say I've been watching you
I even know what you do

Maybe today I'll tell you (maybe today I'll tell you)
I've found the nerve to sell you
On a guy like me
Who wishes that he could be

Your Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you

Right before your eyes I fall in love with you
Right before my eyes you'll say you love me too

Rudolph Valentino
I pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of, oh
