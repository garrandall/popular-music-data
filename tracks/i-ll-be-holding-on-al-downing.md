When your life's full of troubles
And you're down, can't find your way
I'll be there for you to lean on
There's no price that I won't pay

When you need me I'll come running
Darling, you know, I will understand
Walk right up, I'll be your business
You don't say nothing, just wave your hands

Oh, I'll be standing beside you
When you need a helping hand
So reach out your arms, hold me
Don't look back, I'll be holding on

I know you're hurt thinking about me
But I'm here to let you know
That I'm the one that you can believe in
You see

I'll be your light in the sea of darkness
I'll be your sunshine after the rain
All you got to do, reach out and touch me
And I'll be your doctor, and I'll hear you sayin'

Oh, I'll be standing beside you
When you need a helping hand
So reach out your arms, hold me
Don't look back, I'll be holding on

And baby, you gotta believe it
There's one more thing that I wanna say

Lean on me, our love is strong
I'll make it right when things go wrong
Down on my knees I'm begging please
Please don't let me live my life in vain (Please, please, please)

Oh, I'll be standing beside you
When you need a helping hand
So reach out your arms, hold me
Don't look back, I'll be holding on
