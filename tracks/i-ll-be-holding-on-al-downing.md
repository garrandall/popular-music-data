I can hold my liquor
But this man canât handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now


3 cups of hen and I'm on one
Came with one bitch but want all of 'em
Let's ball or somthin'
(Shit, what they lip read?)
My dick and balls or somethin'
(America was built off lies, sex, and money)
And 12K years later, that's the same exact shit here for me
(Aww this thick broad right here I'm tryna)
Break, break down
Cause this liquor breaking me on down


I can hold my liquor
But this man canât handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

From Long Beach, California
Mister Jairus J.Mo Mozee
Mozee


I can hold my liquor
But this man canât handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now




First Imma start with my nigga Al Mac
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Would never live to see his chain swing
But that's the Jesus piece loss
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of braids
Braided by his girl Leecy
Went to Simeon, nigga had game kinda cold
Never killed a soul
So we never had a problem with thinking this ever getting known
Living life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dying like life really going full circle
Thought we was gonna live to see it all
Till that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle


It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah it's true


I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner but shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
While she fussy yelling down the stairs
"I'm on the phone you losers!"
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
Not knowin the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her tardy
He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party


It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah it's true


Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they're both in my pants
I'm a gangster I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on tell you I love you baby
Cuz tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series when a crown went crack nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They Hate a black nigga with getting money's involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the Act seal
If Q said it then you know that shit's real
Pistol grip pump on my lap all times
I used to drive a Hyundai with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the lost that kill bay base kids
So the gun is who my role model is, the illest crip in the biz
Look, I'm never Half of my steppin', I never not with my weapon
So you'll get got in a second like


It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah it's true


Alright man, just for a few seconds
If you got somebody that you lost it was vital to your life
And you feel like you really got a guardian angel right now
I mean, yes I say man, you mean,  at the same time, yeah
Get ready
1, 2, 3, go
Somebody lost a mother, father
1, 2, 3, go
A brother, sister, cousin, best friend
1, 2, 3, go
