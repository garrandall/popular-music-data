I've got a ticket, no turning back
My destination...
The sea of trouble, the land of pain
You're sending me where it always rains
Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation
I'm holding on to my sanity
I feel the beginning of emergency
My hands are slipping, oh please don't let me fall into

This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down

I'm on a planet without a plan
It's oh so lonely
I need to see you to get out of here
There's something deadly in this atmosphere
I'm in a desert, without a drink of your sweet water
You're my oasis in the burning sand
I'm out of danger when you touch my hand
Throw me a lifeline, I'm standing on the edge of...

This deep, dark hole that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom believe me it's a long way down

The gun was loaded, I didn't know
I pulled the trigger,
I heard a noise then the room went dark
I felt the bullet going in my heart
I feel so dizzy, oh please don't let me fall, don't leave me in

This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China 
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of -
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down

I've got a hole in my heart
You've got to fill it up with love
