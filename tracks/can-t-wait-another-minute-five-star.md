I've been holding out on you
I've been talang it slow and tough
'Cause you've got a reputation for leaving
When the loving gets rough

But my heart is reaching for you
And my love is getting stronger
There's an urgency, a need in me
I can't take it any longer

No, I can't wait
Can't wait another minute
For it all to begin
No, I can't wait
Can't wait another minute
So let your love come rushing in

I can't wait, I can't wait

You've been coming on so strong
And I know you've been confused
'Cause I didn't fall so easy
Like the ladies usually do

So here's the answer to your question
I want you all to myself
'Cause I'm oh so good, good for you
No one else will ever do

No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
For it all to begin
No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
So let your love come rushing in

I can't wait

But my heart is reaching for you
And my love is getting stronger
There's an urgency, a need in me
I can't take it any longer

Can't wait
I can't wait another minute
For it all to begin
No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
So let your love, let your love come rushing in
Oh baby

No I can't wait
Can't wait another minute
For it all to begin
No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
So let your love come rushing in

Can't wait
I can't wait another minute
No, no for it all to begin
I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
Another minute, another minute
No, no, no, no

Can't wait
Can't wait another minute
No, no for it all to begin
