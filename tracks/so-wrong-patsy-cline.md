I've been so wrong, for so long 
Thought I could live without the love that you give 
I was wrong, oh, so wrong I've been so wrong, for so long I didn't know that I loved you so I was wrong 
Well, I never knew I could want you darlin' 
Oh, so much 
Now that you're gone, I dream of you 
And your sweet touch I was so wrong, for so long 
But I've seen the light, darlin', I'll make it right I was wrong 
Well, I never knew I could want you darlin' 
Oh, so much 
Now that you're gone, I dream of you 
And your sweet touch I was so wrong, for so long 
But I've seen the light, darlin', I'll make it right I was wrong
