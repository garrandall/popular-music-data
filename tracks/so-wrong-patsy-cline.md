I've been so wrong
For so long
Thought I could live
Without the love that you give
I was wrong oh, so wrong

I've been so wrong
For so long
I didn't know that I loved you so
I was wrong

Well I never knew
I could want you
Darling, oh, so much
Now that you're gone
I dream of you
And your sweet touch

I was so wrong
For so long
But I've seen the light
Darling, I'll make it right
I was wrong

Well, I never knew
I could want you
Darling, oh, so much
Now that you're gone
I dream of you
And your sweet touch

I, was so wrong
For so long
But I've seen the light
Darling, I'll make it right
I was wrong...
