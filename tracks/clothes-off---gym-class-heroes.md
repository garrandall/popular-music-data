(Did you hear about Travis?)
(No, What?)
(I heard heâs been hooking up with a teacher!)
(NICE!)

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

(Ah) I was just a snotty nosed degenerate
With hit pass perfection
Dodginâ teachers down to give my late ass detention
Hardly a heartthrob but I made due
Using those same âcircle yes or noâ
Notes I used in grade school
Folded love letters with a tab that read âpull hereâ
Writinâ back and forth in notebooks for a full year
I used to daydream about Ms. Magnus
The type of fantasies you feel guilty for having
But who hasnât?
The only difference beside the age
Was the fact I acted on it
And who wouldnât?
A schoolboy crush met mature woman lust
And they hit it off so well
And I could tell the day she asked me
To stay after class that it was all bad
But I just bit my lip and acted all mad
The bell rang, class dismissed
The door shut and her skirt went up (Thatâs a Fact!)

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways (let âem keep talking)
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

We gave a brand new meaning
To âafter-school specialâ
The second that our lips touched
She kissed my ribs
And counted each one out loud
I tried my hardest not to giggle
But I couldnât cause it tickled so much
She pulled my pants to half-mast
I said âhurry Miss Sin
You gonna make me late for math classâ
The way she praised my balls was vicious
Now thatâs what I like to call sacrilegious
One time became twenty times
Before we knew it
We stopped caring about where we would do it
From the classroom to the bathroom
And when all the students was gone
Weâd even do it in the staff room
From Fâs to Aâs in less than 3 days
Now the underachieverâs the one with the best grades
Made the third floor shake without breakinâ a sweat
Goddamn it felt good to be the teacherâs pet

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways (let âem keep talking)
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

(Ah) Goodness gracious, accusations
Started flyin' through the building
Cruel As School Children
This isnât how it was supposed to be
Reminiscing donât stand so close to me
And if itâs mostly my fault for letting this shit happen
But I couldnât resist a little adolescent bragging
I mean, after all I was only 15
And she was showing me things
My virgin eyes had never seen
Never forget the little meeting she called
But when she saw my reaction
It made her appalled
So basically what youâre sayin' is
If I donât keep tappinâ that ass
Then you ainât gonna let me pass
Psshh, Some punishment lady
And as I turned towards the door
I looked back
She had her clothes on the floor
Needless to say I passed with flying colors
But my teacher was my best friends mother (damn)

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways (let âem keep talking)
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways (let âem keep talking)
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

And I can hear âem talking in the hallways (let âem keep talking)
Iâm always late for lunch,
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now Iâm a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!)

Ahhh!
