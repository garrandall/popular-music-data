Hey, here is the story
Forget about the trouble in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line


That's why - You need
That's why - This is what you need
I'll give you what you need


Don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from
What you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Just pick it up and throw it into shape

Hey you, won't you listen
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm
I'll take you where you
Really need to be
