There you go
You're always so right
It's all a big show
It's all about you
You think you know
What everyone needs
You always take time
To criticize me


It seems like everyday
I make mistakes
I just can't get it right
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today


So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down


There you go
You never ask why
It's all a big lie
Whatever you do
You think you're special
But I know, and I know, and I know, and we know
That you're not


You're always there to point
Out my mistakes
And shove them in my face
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today


So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Will never bring me down


Don't tell me who I should be (Don't tell me who I should be)
And don't try to tell me what's right for me
Don't tell me what I should do
I don't wanna waste my time
I'll watch you fade away


So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say is gonna bring me down


Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me down
Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me
Shut up, shut up, shut up
