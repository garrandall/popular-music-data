The word is out that I'm about
And I've come gunnin' for you
I'm a real entertainer a mischief maker
A lover of no fixed abode
Oh quick draw on the floor
No law give you more
Sweet talkin' lover of sin
You want what you get
You get what you want
Look out woman
I got gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
The gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
I'm a wanted poster a needed man
Wanted right across the land
I'm a smooth operator a big dictator
Gonna mark you with my brand
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Quick draw
On the floor
Big shot

Stick em' up

Hot to trot big shot take the lot
Never get the drop on me
I'm a real entertainer mischief maker
Love in seven languages
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
This gun's for hire
I shoot you with desire
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

What you got
Big shot
You can't get
You can't get the drop
On me
