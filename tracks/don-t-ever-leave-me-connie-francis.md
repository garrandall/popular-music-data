Baby, Baby - I've been waiting
For somebody to love just me
I'm so happy now that I found you
I'll stand by you till eternity

Don't ever leave me, don't ever let me go
I wouldn't know what to do, I wouldn't know where to go
Don't ever leave me, I'm giving you my heart
And it would break in two if we should ever part

Baby, tell me how much you love me
And I have something to say to you
I will always make you happy
And I promise that I will be true

Don't ever leave me, don't ever let me go
I wouldn't know what to do, I wouldn't know where to go
Don't ever leave me, I'm giving you my heart
And it would break in two if we should ever part

Don't ever leave me, don't ever let me go
I wouldn't know what to do, I wouldn't know where to go
Don't ever leave me, I'm giving you my heart
And it would break in two if we should ever part

Baby, Baby - don't ever leave me
Don't ever leave me...
