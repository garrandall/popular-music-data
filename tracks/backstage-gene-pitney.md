A thousand hands applaud tonight 
I sing my songs my star shines bright 
I stop and smile I take my bow 
I leave the stage and then somehow 

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry 
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little 

Out on that stage I play the star 
I'm famous now I've come so far 
A famous fool I let love go 
I didn't know I'd miss you so 

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry 
Hating myself since I let you say goodbye 

Every night a different room 
Every night a different club 
And yet I'm lonely all the time 
When I sign my autograph 
When I hold an interview 
Can't get you out of my mind 

Come back my love come back to me 
I need you now so desperately 
What good is fame it's just a game 
I'd give it all to be the same 

Backstage I wait now, hoping I'll see 
Your smiling face waiting there backstage for me 
Your smiling face waiting backstage for me 
Backstage 
Backstage
