Here we are
Back in love again this time unlike before
You and I
Giving so much more
Learning what it really means to love someone
To trust in love

Sharing life as one
In a special way

Time be still
Listen to my heart it?s beating strong and clear
And so fast
Yes, it's love, you know
Filling empty days that now seem so long ago
We found love

Trusting in each other
In a special way
 Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way

I know miracles do come true
The moment I laid my eyes on you
 That love has shown us that special way
To love, to hold each other in a special way



To love, to hold each other

Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way
