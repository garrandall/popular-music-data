Wake up, everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed
So very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred
War and poverty, whoa, oh

Wake up, all the teachers
Time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To what you have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children
Teach 'em the very best you can


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me


Wake up, all the doctors
Make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer
And who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long
Before the Judgment Day
So won't'cha make them happy
Before they pass away

Wake up, all the builders
Time to build a new land
I know we can do it
If we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do
Is put it in our minds
Surely things will work out
They do it every time


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me


Change it, yeah
Change it, yeah
Just you and me
Change it, yeah
Change it, yeah
Can't do it alone
Can't do it alone
Need some help, y'all
Can't do it alone
Can't do it alone, yeah, yeah
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Just you need a little help
Need some y'all
To change the world
What it used to be
Can't do it alone
Can't do it alone
Need some help, yeah
Need some help, yeah
Wake up, everybody
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Wake up, come on, come on
Wake up, everybody
Teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To what you have to say
Wake up, everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead
Come on
Wake up, everybody
I'm talkin' about the dope pusher
Stop pushin' that dope
Dope users

Wake up, yeah
Wonder what you tell me, yeah
Wonder what you tell me now
