Wow!

Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you it must be true
No one could look as good as you

Mercy!

Pretty woman won't you pardon me
Pretty woman I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, Oh you look lovely as you could be
Are you lonely just like me

Adrrrrr...

Pretty woman stop a while
Pretty woman talk a while
Pretty woman give your smile to me
Pretty woman yeah yeah yeah
Pretty woman look my way
Pretty woman say you'll stay with me
Cause I need you, need you tonight

Uh!

Pretty woman don't walk on by
Pretty woman don't make me cry
Pretty woman don't walk away, yeah, okay
If that's the way it must be, okay
I guess Ill go home, its late, maybe tomorrow night...
But wait.. what do I see..
She's walking back to me

Wow!
Wow!
Pretty woman
