"Honey, let me tell you something
No man in the world!"

Don't wait for me
Cause I won't be there
Not this time
Boy can't you see
That I am leaving you behind


Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you were doing
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you were doing

The only one
I was your baby
That's what I thought
But you had your fun
You tried to play me
And now you're caught

(I've tried and I've tried just to hide it)
Hide the way I feel
But that's not real
(I've tried and I've tried to deny it)
But you did me wrong
So I'm moving, moving on

"Honey, let me tell you something
No man in the world!"

(I've tried and I've tried to deny it)
But you did me wrong
So I'm moving, moving on



What you did to me I can't believe
Now I realize baby I was
Too blind, too blind I was
I realize
I can't believe, oh baby I was...
