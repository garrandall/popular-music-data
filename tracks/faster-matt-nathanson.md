You're so delicious
You're so soft
Sweet on the tip of my tongue
You taste like sunlight
And strawberry bubble gum

You bite my lip
You spike my blood
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster

It's the way you swell, slow
Pushing right out your seams
It's the way you smile, baby
When you've got me on my knees

Your all night noise
Your siren's howl
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster

'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
I beg and steal, I follow you
Yeah, you own me
And you make my heart beat faster

(I can't get enough
Because it's on like
I guess this world is over to me)

You own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
