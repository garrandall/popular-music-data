What you hear is not a test
Wha wha wha wha wha
What you hear is not a test
Wha wha wha wha wha Wha
What What you hear is not a test


I'm on a mission
Sun is out 
My skin is glistenin'
Got my jeans on 
Tank top, chillin
With my girlfriends
Looking fabulous
My tan is just amazin'
Turn it up
That song is blazin'
(Call Me)
I'm headed to LA and
Gotta make sure I ask Timbaland

Can you give a song like
Rock The Boat (Oh, hey)
Rock The Boat
Rock The Boat
Can you give me a song
That you and Missy wrote (She's dope)
Missy wrote
Missy wrote
Somethin' like Get Ur Freak On (Hey)
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on (Ohh)
Make me something I can get my groove on
Somethin' I can get my groove on

3 O'clock at the studio
Timbaland is playin (? kinda low)
Fell the love in the room
Soon as I hit the door
Bubba's pacin' around gettin' ready to flow
Tim is in the corner doin' a track
Bobbin' his head
I know he's feelin' that
Take his headphones off
And he looks my way
And he asks me what I wanna do
And I say

Can you give a song like
Rock The Boat (Oh)
Rock The Boat
Rock The Boat (Yea)
Can you give me a song
That you and Missy wrote 
Missy wrote
Missy wrote (Missy wrote)
Somethin' like Get Ur Freak On (Yeah)
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on (Sing on)
Make me something I can get my groove on 
Somethin' I can get my groove on

And then he asked if I liked this
Oh do you like this
But do you like this
And then he flipped it
And then we start to move
We're gettin in the groove
He says it's just for you
And I'm glad I asked

Can you give a song like (Whoa)
Rock The Boat 
Rock The Boat (Rock The Boat)
Rock The Boat (Rock The Boat)
Can you give me a song
That you and Missy wrote (Missy wrote) 
Missy wrote (Missy wrote)
Missy wrote 
Somethin' like Get Ur Freak On (On)
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on (Sing on)
Make me something I can get my groove on (I can get my groove on, yay)
Somethin' I can get my groove on

Can you give a song like
Rock The Boat (Rock The Boat)
Rock The Boat (Rock The Boat)
Rock The Boat
Can you give me a song
That you and Missy wrote (Missy wrote)
Missy wrote (Missy wrote, yeah)
Missy wrote 
Somethin' like Get Ur Freak On (Oh yeah)
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on (Sing on)
Make me something I can get my groove on (I can get my groove on)
Somethin' I can get my groove on (I can get my groove on, yeah)


I think I got somethin' for you
oh
I think I got somethin' for you
Oh
I think I got somethin' for you
