One last time let me love you one last time
All I need is one more chance to say goodbye
One last kiss then I swear I'll let you go baby I need you I've got to see you
One more night stay with me till tomorrow
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come (baby I need you)
One last time loving you before the end I can't face never seeing you again
One last look in your eyes to know we're through baby I need you I've got to see you
One more night stay with me till tomorrow
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come
Baby I need you (one last time) I've got to see you (one last time)
Baby I need you (one last time) baby I need you (one last time)
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)
