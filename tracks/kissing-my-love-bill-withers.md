Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
Yeah thump a thumping in my head

Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see a pretty city
With a million flowers babe

Now I can hear the angels sing
Songs that only angels sing
She's such a pretty thing
That I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love

Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins
Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
She's such a tender sender
With her sweet young friends

She's so good at what she does
All she wants to do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love

Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock


Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins
Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
She's such a tender sender
With her sweet young friends

Whoa now

She's so good at what she does
All she wants to do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love
