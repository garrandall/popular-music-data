Whoa now, when I'm kissing my love
I feel thump-thumping in my head
Oh now, when I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see a pretty city
With a million flowers babe, yeah yeah

Oh now I can hear the angels sing
Songs that only angels sing
She's such a pretty thing
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love

Whoa now, when I'm kissing my love
I feel the blood pumping in my veins
Oh now, when I'm kissing my love
She's such a tender sender, uh
With a sweet, sweet, sweet, young frame, yeah huh

How now, she's so good at what she does
All she wanna do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love

Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock
Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock
Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock
Put your foot on the rock and no you just
Don't stop, put your foot on the

Oh now, when I'm kissing my love
I feel the blood pumping in my veins, yeah
Whoa, when I'm kissing my love
She's a tender sender
With her sweet young friend
With her sweet young friend

Oh now, she's so good at what she does
All she wanna do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love
