Hear me why you keep fooling
Little coquette
Making fun of the ones who loves you

Breakin' hearts you are rulin'
Little coquette
True hearts tenderly dreaming of you

Someday you'll fall in love
As I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love
Will just be foolin' too

And when you're all alone
With all your regrets
You know my little coquette
I love you

Someday you'll fall in love
As I fell in love with you
Now Maybe the one you love
Will just be foolin' too

And when you're all alone
With all your regrets
You know my little coquette
I love you
