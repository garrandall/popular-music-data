I can almost hear the stillness
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
And I can almost hear the echo
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before

I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
I only know that I have waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
And as I taste your tender kisses

I can tell you've never been this far before

And as I take the love you're giving
I can feel the tension building in your mind
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight
You have no way of knowing
But tonight will only make me love you more
And I hope that you'll believe me
'Cause I know you've never been this far before
