We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you


But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'
Uh


It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah


And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'


Jackson 5 join along with me, say
Doo doo wop, hey hey hey doo doo wop
Oh oh doo doo wop, oh oh doo doo wop
Oh oh Doo doo wop, oh oh doo doo wop


We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life, hm
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice, mm hm


Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'
Yeah, nothin' (Na-na-nothing)


Jackson 5 join along with me, say
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop


Sing it loud for the people, say
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop, doo doo wop
