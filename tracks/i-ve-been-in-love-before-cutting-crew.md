Oh, oo ohcha
Catch my breath, close my eyes
Don't believe a word
Things she said, overheard
Something wrong inside
Hits you in a minute, oh
Then you know you're in it, ah

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

Just one touch, just one look
A dangerous dance
One small word can make me feel
Like running away
You can't say you're in it, no, until you reach the limit

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

I've been in love
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love
I've been in love before
