A word's just a word
‘Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change


Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on


Just smile (Just smile)
And the world (and the world)
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
That's meant for one will become two
•If we take the chances•
*To change circumstances*
Imagine all we can do, if we


Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on (Oh, send it on)


There's power in all of the choices we make
So I’m starting now, there's not a moment to waste


A word's just a word
‘Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away


Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action, the chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong (Shine a light)
Shine a light, and send it on


Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
