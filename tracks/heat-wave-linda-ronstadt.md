Whenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel, yeah yeah
Well I feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

Sometimes I stare into space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it
Don't understand it
I hadn't ever felt like this before
Now that funny feeling has me amazed
I Don't know what to do
My head's in a haze

It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh (heat wave)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
oh (heat wave)

Don't pass up this chance
This time it's true romance
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave
Oooh heat wave
