No time for the movie show, TV, or the radio
Gotta write a symphony, end it with some poetry
Tie them with a ribbon made of gold and give them to Cindy
Today is Cindy's birthday
No time for geometry, 'rithmetic, or history
Gotta write a song from my heart, then pick the greatest work of art
Tie them with a ribbon made of gold and give them to Cindy
Today is Cindy's birthday
No time to do the Twist, don't mind all the things I miss
Gotta write a melody, write it from the heart of me
Tie it with a ribbon made of gold and give it to Cindy
Today is Cindy's birthday
Yes, Cindy's happy birthday
