When darkness falls upon your heart and soul
I'll be the light that shines for you
When you forget how beautiful you are
I'll be there to remind you
When you can't find your way
I'll find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be


And when you're there with no one there to hold
I'll be the arms that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
I'll be there to believe in you
When all you find are lies
I'll be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be


I'll be the sun
When your heart's filled with rain
I'll be the one
To chase the rain away


I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be
