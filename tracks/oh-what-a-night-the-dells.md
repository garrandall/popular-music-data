Oh what a night, to love you, dear
Oh what a night, to hold you near
Oh what a night, to squeeze you, dear
That's why I love you so!

Oh what a night, to love you, dear
Oh what a night, to walk you, dear
Oh what a night, to kiss you, dear
That's why I love you so!

I won't forget all those things
You have told to me
The craze in my heart
Won't let me forget your love

Oh what a night, to love you, dear
Oh what a night, to hold you near
Oh what a night, to squeeze you, dear
That's why I love you so!

Oh what a night, to love you, dear
Oh what a night, to want you, dear
Oh what a night, to kiss you, dear
That's why I love you so!
