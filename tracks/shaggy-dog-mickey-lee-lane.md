Do the bird, pretty bird 'cause the bird is the word,
Do the dog, dirty dog like a daddy frog,
Do the shake, milk shake like a hairy ape,
I said ya ya yaga yaga boom chick a ga ga
Come on come on come on pretty baby
Come on come on shake it like crazy
Come on come on come on pretty baby yeah
Come on come on come on pretty baby
Come on come on shake it like crazy
Come on come on come on pretty baby yeah
Do the bop, sugar flop til you blow your top
Now you stomp, flip flop and you shake your mop
Like the frog and the log and the shaggy dog
I said a ya ya yaga yaga boom chick a ga ga

Come on come on come on pretty baby
Come on come on shake it like crazy
Come on come on come on pretty baby yeah
Come on come on come on pretty baby,
Come on come on shake it like crazy,
Come on come on come on pretty baby yeah.
