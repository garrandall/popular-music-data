Hey baby, save the poetry
Keep your happiness to yourself


I don't ask for every day to be sunny
I don't ask for there to be a party every Friday
Nor do I ask that you return to me begging for forgiveness
If you cry with dry eyes
Talking about her
Oh, my love, it hurts me so much (it hurts me so much)
That you left without telling me where you were going
Oh, my love, it was torture to lose you


I know I haven't been a saint
But I can fix it, love
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours
It's best if you save all that
Throw that bone to another dog
And we'll say goodbye


I can't ask winter to pardon a rose
I can't ask the elm trees to bear pears
I can't ask eternity from a mere mortal
And walk around throwing thousands of pearls to the pigs
Oh, my love, it hurts so much, it hurts so much
That you don't believe in my promises anymore
Oh, my love, it's torture to lose you


I know I haven't been a saint
But I can fix it, love
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours
It's best if you save all that
Throw that bone to another dog
And we'll say goodbye


Don't leave, don't leave
Hey, baby, look, don't get angry
You have my love from Monday to Friday
But it's best if you leave Saturday to me
Hey, baby, don't punish me any more
Because out there, without you, I can't find peace
I'm just a repentant man
I'm like a bird that returns to its nest


I know I haven't been a saint
I'm not made of stone
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours


Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Oh, all that I've done for you
It was torture to lose you
It hurts me so much that it's like this
Keep crying for forgiveness
I'm not going to cry over you anymore
