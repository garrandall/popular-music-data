Let's take a trip, on the other side of the land
With things ain't planned for the average man
You can be a young brother who's rolling
And now things so good that you're holding
Big bank, top rank
Mr. Too Cold, who got all the hoes
Pushin hard to keep from being bound
Cause there's always somebody tryin to bring you down
Try to run a scheme on what you got
'Cause what you got, them niggas jot
Women love it and brothers hate it
They just can't stand to see you make it
A girl can be your main downfall
She don't take half, the hoe takes all
Now check to see how your cards are dealt
And stay true to yourself


Keep cool, little girl
You got what you deserve
Don't copycat when a rich hoes splurge
Cause yo, you might break yourself
Trying to keep up with somebody else
Waiting for the mailman to bring you a check
(Money all gone) Now you're a wreck
Taking your friends out for a big feast
You wanna treat and you don't even eat
Looking all stupid with a messed up grin
Trying to be nice so you can fit in?
Huh! Couldn't get your hair done
Now you're unhappy cause your head all nappy
And it's a shame, you ain't got no money
Girl, that shit ain't funny
No friends to cope, you got with the dope
Wasn't true, now it ain't no hope
Shoulda been true to yourself

Momma always told me, there'd be days like this
On top of all of this bullshit
Never, ever let a young girl make you
Let alone, a hoe break you
Being strong in the mind will make you a true
And make you jack no one and make them jack you
Yo, K, come express how you feel
Show 'em how to be, real


True, open your eyes and look
The best friend might be the crook
You solved the case but you still winded up
Saying nothing - yet, that's your best friend
'Till the end, now he in trouble
Where's the friend? He left with a hoe
And you're stuck, outta luck
Nobody else helps, you shoulda been true to yourself


Ayo, Quik why don't you show 'em you're true to these tables


Yeah, this shit goes out to all them people
Who ain't true to theyself
Runnin up behind somebody else, following in they shadow
Get on your own tip, fools
(And stay out the next man nuts)
Haha, we out
