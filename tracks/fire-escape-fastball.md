Well I don't wanna be President 
Superman or Clark Kent 
I don't wanna walk 'round in their shoes 

'Cause I don't know who's side I'm on 
I don't know my right from wrong 
I don't know where I'm going to 
I don't know about you 


I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape 
And I may not be the man you want me to 
I can be myself, how 'bout you? 

I don't wanna make you mad 
I don't wanna meet your dad 
I don't wanna be your dream come true 

'Cause I don't know just what I've found 
I don't know my sky from ground 
I don't know where I'm going to 
I don't know about you 





I can be myself, how 'bout you? 
I can be myself 
How 'bout you?
