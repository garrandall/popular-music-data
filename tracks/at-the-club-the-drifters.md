Well, Friday night
Has finally come around
And me and my baby gonna
Head for a spot we found
We're gonna forget our cares
And dance on into the night
Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
We're gonna say that it's all right
For two bits and a dollar
They've got a swinging show or you
Whoa, yes, they do
And the band won't quit
'Til everybody tell them to
And when they place that slow dance
You can hold your baby tight
Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
We're gonna say that it's all right
Hey, they've got lots of pretty
Dancing girls for the fellows
But, oh, you better watch out
In case your baby get jealous
Now some people might like to sit
And watch a picture show
But if that's what your plans are
Don't ask me to go
Cause I'll be where the good times
Last 'til the early morning light
Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
They're gonna say that it's all right
It's all right (it's all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Let me tell you, it's all right
