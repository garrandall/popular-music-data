I used to think that
The best things in life
Were the things that
Only money could buy

So I hustled instead
Never took time to pray
There was nothing new
That I wouldn't try

Hey, then one day I found
There was no love around
I was feeling kind
Of empty inside

Without the love of someone
Living just ain't no fun
That's when I first realized

That it's love that really counts
Everything else can run out
And if you find a love that's true
Better try your best to
Keep her with you

So many people
Confused these days
Trying hard to find satisfaction
Spending all kinds of cash
Talking all kinds of trash
Just to be that main attraction

Girl, but I had to stop
And ask myself just
What this life's all about
I know that money is cool
But I can't be no fool
There's just one thing
I can't be without

And I know it's
Love that really counts
Because everything
Else can run out
And if you find a love that's true
Better try your best to
Keep her with you

Hey, so if you don't know
Then you'll soon find out
Every word I say is true

Without the love of someone
Living just ain't no fun
Girl, I'm so in love with you

I know it's love
That really counts
Because everything
Everything else can run out
And if you find a love that's true
Better try your best to
Keep her with you

It's love that really counts
I know, I know it's
Love that really counts
Everything else can run out
And if you find a love
A love that's true
Better try your best to
Keep her with you

Love that really counts
Love that really counts
Everything else can run out
And if you find a love
A love that's true
Better try your best to
Keep her with you
