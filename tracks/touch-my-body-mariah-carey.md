MC, you're the place to be

I know that you've been waiting for it
I'm waiting too
In my imagination I'd be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me
Hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me
When I do (I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick
On YouTube (YouTube)

'Cause if you run your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my bidness
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private
Between you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more

Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did

Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste

Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

Boy, you can put me on you
Like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter
Than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me
Like a tropical breeze
And float away with you
In the Caribbean Sea

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me
When I do (I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick
On YouTube (YouTube)

'Cause if you run your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my bidness
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private
Between you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more

Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did

Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste

Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

I'm 'a treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me

You won't want for nothing boy
I will give you plenty of joy
Touch my body

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
(throw me on the floor)
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more

Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did

Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
(let me wrap my thighs)
All around your waist
Just a little taste
(around your waist, for just a little taste)

Touch my body
Know you love my curves
(I know you like it)
Come on and give me what I deserve
(give me what I deserve, babe!)
And touch my body

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh oh oh oh

Touch my body
(every little way you like to touch my body baby)

Just touch my body
Yeah ohoohaby
Oh ohooh
Touch my body
Uh ohoohhoh
Come on and give me what I deserve!
Touch my body
Oh! Oh oh ooh
Touch my body
