All night, I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go
Never let you go
I'll hold you tight all night
I'll never let you go

I've had my share of heartache and pain
I've been with users, and losers, and seen all of their games
But no one makes me feel the way you do
There was a time when I was so all alone
There was no lover, no other I could call my own
But now that I met you, those days are through

I'll never let you go
I'll keep you on my heart (Never let you go)
Until the end of time
I'll hold you tight all night
Never, never let you go

You are the earth and I am the sea
The world together, forever, I'll be all that you need
You and I were always meant to be
If you should leave and go your own way
I'll still love, I will survive, but every night I'll pray
That you will find your way right back to me

I'll never let you go
I'll keep you on my heart (Never let you go)
Until the end of time
I'll hold you tight all night
I'll never let you go

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

Day after day, and night after night
I screamed your name and you just came
Now everything's alright
Lovin' you has made my life complete

When I'm with you, it's like a dream that's come true
My emotions start to blow
My skies are blue when my eyes gaze on you
And I think that you should know

I'll never let you go
I'll keep you on my heart (Never let you go)
Until the end of time

I'll never let you go
I'll keep you on my heart (Never let you go)
Until the end of time
I'll hold you tight all night
I'll never let you go
