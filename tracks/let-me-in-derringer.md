One, two, three, four

Let me in, sweet mama
It's your wandering boy
Knocking now on your front door

Let me in, sweet mama
It's your bundle of joy
Coming home from his personal war

Open up, dear darling
It's your baby out here
Begging you to forgive

Let me in, little sweetheart
Or, mama, I fear
I won't find me no reason to live

I had my taste of freedom
And it tasted pretty bad
I swear it's a jungle out there

But it sure made me realize
What a good thing I had
A good thing
They say you still care

Come on, sweet mama
Let the shout in your heart
Back where he's always been

And I swear there ain't nothing
Gonna tear us apart
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Won't you let me in

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby, let me in
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, let me in

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, honey, let me in
