It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to 

And I was thinking if you were lonely 
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know 
At least not to the point that we would think so 

And everyone here knows everyone here is thinking about somebody else 
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads 

And I couldn't tell
If anyone here was feeling the way I do 
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how 
To get it back to good 

This don't mean that, you own me
Well, this ain't no good
In fact it's phony as hell 
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted to

If you see me out you don't know me 
Try to turn your head
Try to give me some room 
How to figure out just what I'm gonna do 

'Cause everyone here hates everyone here for doing just like they do 
And it's best if we all keep this quiet instead 

And I couldn't tell
Why everyone here was doing me like they do 
But I'm sorry now
And I don't know how 
To get it back to good 

Well, everyone here is wondering what it's like to be with somebody else 
And everyone here's to blame
And everyone here gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain
Well, everyone here hides shades of shame
But looking inside we're the same, we're the same 
And we're all grown now
Yeah, but we don't know how 
To get it back to good 

Well, everyone here knows everyone here is thinking 'bout somebody else 
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads, in our heads

See, I couldn't tell 'bout
If anyone here was feeling the way I do 
That's over now
And I don't know how
Guess it's over now 
There's no getting back to good
