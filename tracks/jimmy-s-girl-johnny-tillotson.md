Jimmy's girl Jimmy's girl
Wish that I were holding Jimmy's girl

I'm in love with Jimmy's girl though I've never met her
Still I can't forget her Jimmy's girl

Jimmy's always telling me that her hair is golden
Wish that I were holdin' Jimmy's girl
He says her lips are warm each time they kiss good night
And just as sweet as any lips can be
And then I close my eyes and though it's make believe
I pretend she's in love with me

How I long for Jimmy's girl but her love is taken
So my heart is breakin' for Jimmy's girl
When I close my eyes although it's make believe
I pretend she's in love with me

I'm in love with Jimmy's girl but her love is taken
So my heart is breakin' for Jimmy's girl
How my heart is breakin' for Jimmy's girl
