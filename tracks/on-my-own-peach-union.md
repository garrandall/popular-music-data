Baby
No, it's not that I don't care
Maybe
It's a change in atmosphere


And I've seen the signs I know
That it's right for me to go
I'm on my way


So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me

And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see it through alone
I've got to do this on my own


Baby
You could say that it's unfair
Maybe
I've got nothing left to share


And I've seen the signs I know
That it's right for me to go
I'm on my way


So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me

And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see this through alone
I've got to do this on my own


On my own
On my own
Own


So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me

And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see it through alone
I've got to do this on my own


On my own
On my own
On my own
