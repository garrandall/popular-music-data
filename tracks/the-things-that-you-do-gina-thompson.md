Oh-ho, oh-ho, ohhh... Nina Sky-y-ighhhh...


DJ Envy, Red Cafe, The Co-op!


The things you do, keeps me, in love with you


Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is R Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
to have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster


The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (What else! OK!)


It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so good you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your scream
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

 
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you 
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you 


OK! OK! I know ytou like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together


I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need to be chasin, no no no

 
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you 
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you 


Uh huh, oh oh (Yeah! It's The Co-op!) Oh oh oh
