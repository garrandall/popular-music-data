And I am all alone
There is no one here beside me
And my problems have all gone
There is no one to deride me

But yah got to have friends
The feeling's oh so strong
Yah got to have friends
To make that day last long

I had some firends but they're gone
Somethin' came and took them away
And from the dusk 'til the dawn
Here is where I'll stay

Standing at the end of the road, boys
Waiting for my new friends to come
I don't care if I'm hungry or poor
I'm gonna get me some of them

'Cause you got to have friends
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, friends
That's right you, oh you, yeah you
I said you gotta have some friends
I'm talkin' about friends, that's right, friends
Friends, friends, friends

I had some firends, oh, but they're all gone, gone
Somethin' came and snatched them away
And from the dusk until the ran ran dawn, you know
Here is where I gotta stay, here is where I gotta stay

And I'm standing at the end of a real long road
And I'm waiting for my new friends to come
I don't care if I'm hungry or freezin' cold
I'm gonna get me some of them

'Cause you gotta have friends
That's right, friends, friends
I gotta get my, I gotta get my, I gotta get my
Look around and see all of my friends
Oh, friends, that's right, friends, friends
Friends, friends, friends, friends, oh
Friends, you gotta have friends . .
