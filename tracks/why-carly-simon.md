Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does you love hurt so much?
Don´t know why

You know I loved you baby
But all the while you just betrayed me
In the world of a day
All the things that you said were

Ladidadida

Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does your love hurt so much?
Don´t know why

You said our love was secret
But you left me alone to make it
You want to come back again someday
But darling here´s what I say

Why does your love hurt so much?
