Oh wasted love

So I'm not supposed to love you no more
I guess I'm not suppose to care.
I held you so close, now I'm holding a ghost
How can love just disappear?
And where does it go when it's over?
I know that it's somewhere out here

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Oh wasted love
Oh wasted love

It's late, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight
Baby, I'm chasing my shadow around
Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets
I can't change what I've become
There's pain and there's glory, but this is my story
I'm asking everyone

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Bring it back to me, all my wasted love
