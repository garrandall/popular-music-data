I was standing at 7:15 waiting for my baby's car
Just then out stepped the driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far
I said I've got my mind made up
I don't wanna leave him baby cause it's clear to me
That it's just to tough to find another lover like mine

With the right stuff
The right stuff baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Oh no with mr. right

Just friday 'bout a week ago
This fellow called me on the phone
And said 'i live in paris, don't you want to go
I know you must be all alone'

Well, it'll take more than a fancy trip
Or a chauffeured limousine
Cause I ain't never seen no one

Who could give me love like this
The other fellows don't compare

To the right stuff
The right stuff baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Oh no with mr. right
Sing

He's the only to give me that lovin'
Cause next to him there is no other one
He's very sexy and oh so sweet
And he knocks me off my feet
Say it

I need the right stuff
I got to have the right stuff
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
