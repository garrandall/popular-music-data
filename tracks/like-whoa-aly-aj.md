Life is good I can't complain
I mean I could but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good, good, good

Now I'm rolling my window down
I love the wind but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good


Like a rollercoaster ride
Holdin' on white knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
Can't believe I'm like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like

In the morning it begins again
Feels like I'm falling better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good



My inhibitions are beginning to let go
This situation
I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good
I'm holding on,
(holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin')
I'm holdin' on

Like a rollercoaster ride
Like I'm running a red light
Like a rocket ship in flight
There's nothing else that makes me feel like WHOA!

Like a roller coaster
Whoa
Holding on white knuckles
Whoa
Once you let your love in
Whoa
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
Whoa, whoa
