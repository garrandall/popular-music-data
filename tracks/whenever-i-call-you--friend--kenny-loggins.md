Whenever I call you "Friend"
I begin to think I understand
Anywhere we are
You and I have always been
Forever and ever
I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do
Always takes me home to you
Forever and ever
Now I know my life has given me more than memories
Day by day, we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doing it
Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doing it

Whenever I call you "Friend"
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are
You and I were meant to be
Forever and ever
I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
And ever our love will last
I always want to call you "Friend"

Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doing it



And now I know my life
Has given me more than memories, day by day
We can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doing it, doing it
Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Sweet love, sweet love
You're the glowin' light in my life
Source of pride in my life
