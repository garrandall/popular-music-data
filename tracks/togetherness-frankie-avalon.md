Two hearts are
Better than one heart
Four lips are sweeter than two
Come close to me
Let's kiss and see
What togetherness, can do

Two dreams are
Better than one dream
Four arms can make them come true
Let's pool our love
Follow the school
Love togetherness, right through

There's strength in numbers
Everybody knows
Between us, we'll have
Twenty fingers, twenty toes

No one should ever be lonely
No one should ever be blue
Love's not for one
It's made for two
So together let's find
Togetherness, for two

(Let's pool our love
Follow the rules
Love togetherness
Right through)

There's strength in numbers
Everybody knows
Between us we'll have
Twenty fingers, twenty toes

No one should ever be lonely
No one should ever be blue
Love's not for one
It's made for two
So together let's try
Togetherness, for two
