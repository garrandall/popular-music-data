Wind it up baby
Awww, shake it pretty daddy
I'm gonna ride that train tonight
Goodbye

Wheel rollin' down the track
Make your true lovin' daddy
Don't come back
I wanna move
I got the hoot!
Well don't you hesitate when I'm motorin'
I wanna move on

One of these days
And it won't be long
You're gonna look for Matt Lucas
Matt Lucas be gone
I wanna move
I got the hoot!
You're flyin' much too high
When you give him the eye
I wanna move on

I got the hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Why hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
I got the hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
I got the hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
I wanna move pretty baby
Move it on down the line
I got the hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Why hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Yeah hoot
Ch-ck-ch-ck
I wanna hoot
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Well goodbye pretty baby
I'm on my way
I wanna move on

Engineer, take a throttle in hand
And won't you move me right down
To that good lovin' land
I got the hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Why hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Well I'm on my way
I'm goin' home to stay
I wanna move on

I wanna hoot!
I wanna hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
I wanna hoot!
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Get rid of these flutes
Ch-ck-ch-ck

You're flyin' much too high
When you gave him the eye
I wanna move on

I got the hoot!
I got the hoot!
Baby!
Baby!

You're flyin' much too high
When you gave him the eye
I wanna move

Well don't you hesitate
I wanna motivate
I want to move on
Well get yourself under control
I got to go
I want to move on
Goodbye baby

Ch-ck-ch-ck
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Ch-ck-ch-ck
Ch-ck-ch-ck
