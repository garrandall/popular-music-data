Gotta get close to me, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms
And listen to the voice of my heart
Oh OhOOh

Searchin' my soul, searchin' for somethin'
To find a way to make you believe, yeah
And what can I say, words don't mean nothin'
Oh, what can I do, to prove what I'm feelin' for you
Oh, I could promise you love eternally
Swear you mean the world to me
Tell you over and over, get down on my knees
To hold you and make you believe

Gotta get close to you, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms, and listen to the voice of my heart
Baby, the only way you'll know the sound inside my soul
Gotta get close to me, and listen to the voice of my heart

Look into my eyes, don't look behind you
Let me take you where heaven is waiting
Right here in my arms, yeah
I promise this time, real love will find you
Oh, what can I do, to just make this one thing come true
Oh, I would take your heart, into my hands
Shelter you, make you understand
Tell you over and over, you're all that I need
To hold you and make you believe

Gotta get close to you, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms, and listen to the voice of my heart
Baby, the only way you'll know the sound inside my soul
Gotta get close to me, and listen to the voice of my heart

Talkin' 'bout some deep emotion
You'll find it when you look in my eyes
Lookin' for some real emotion
Come into my life, come into my arms
Come closer, come closer
It don't mean a thing until I can make you believe

Gotta get close to me, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms
And listen to the voice of my heart

Gotta get close to you, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms, and listen to the voice of my heart
Baby, the only way you'll know the sound inside my soul
Gotta get close to me, and listen to the voice of my heart

(Listen to the voice of my heart) Baby
(Listen to the voice of my heart)
Gotta get close to me, gotta let love inside
Baby, get close to me
