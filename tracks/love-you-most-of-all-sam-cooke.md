Your my girl you're so sweet
Honey you can't be beat
I love you, I love you
Most of all

I believe you can rock, you can roll
You're so fine
Honey, you're mine, all mine
That's why I love you, I love you
Most of all

Well, I love the way you move me
When you walk
I love the way you thrill me
When you talk
And, oh baby, when you hold my hand
Tell me, pretty baby, that you understand

When we walk down the street
All the fellas go "wooo weeee"
That's why I love you
I love you most of all

I love ya, I love ya, most of all

Well, and let me tell ya honey
You're my girl, you're just so sweet
Honey you can't be beat
I love you, I love you most of all

Well and I believe you can rock, you can roll
You're so fine
Honey you're mine all mine
That's why I love you
I love you most of all

Well, I love the way you move me
When you walk
I love the way you thrill me
When you talk
And, oh baby, when you hold my hand
Tell me, pretty baby, that you understand

When we walk down the street
All the fellas go "wooo weeee"
That's why I love you
I love you most of all
