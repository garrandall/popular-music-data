You were sun, I was sky
And you gently moved into me
And your light came
Shining through me
To the darkness inside

You were touch, I was feel
And the love just eased between us
As though time had never seen us
When you're up that high
Then say goodbye


It ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
It was so easy to pretend
Our world would never end
But suddenly, I found
It's coming down

You were rain, I was earth
And I needed you for growing
And my life was overflowing
With the feeling of you

I was sand, you were sea
And you made the tide move faster
But the wind was still your master
Though you wanted me
You must be free



Down, down, down, down

It ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
