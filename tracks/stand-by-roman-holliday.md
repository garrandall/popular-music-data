Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way

Well when they say you've lost your touch I smiled
They couldn't handle anything you're laying down
It's a fact you put the "snap" in crocodile

You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by

My aftershave has given my hiding place away
Stiletto heels a split skirt, you're a dream
But when you locked that bedroom door I screamed

You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by

Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way

You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by

You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
