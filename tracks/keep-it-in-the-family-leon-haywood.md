Oh keep it in the family, baby
If there's a problem in our home
We can solve it there, baby
We may have misunderstandings sometimes
But baby, I'm yours and I know you're mine, ohyeah

Hey, it's a family affair, baby
And we can work it out, yeah
We don't need no help from strangers
'Cause they don't know what it's all about

Hey, they're outside looking in, baby
Trying to put their two cents in
With misleading information
Trying to break up our relation

But it's a family affair
And we can work it out, baby
We won't seek no help from strangers
'Cause that would add to the problem, baby oh

Keep it in the family
Just keep it in the family, baby

We got to put faith where there's been doubt
'Cause faith and trust is what love's about
Life ain't always a bed of roses
Where sweet fragrance fills the air

But it's a family affair, baby
And we can work it out, baby
We don't need no help from strangers
'Cause that would keep our love in danger

It's a family affair, baby
And we can work it out, baby
Keep it in the family, baby
Keep it in the family, baby
