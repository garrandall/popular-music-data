You're so good
I hadda come back for more
I hadda have it one more time
You're so good, you're so fine
That I hadda have it

Ever since I met you
I been dying for to pet you
And I'm coming out to get you
Cause I never had it
Better than you, babe
I'm telling you true, babe

Girl, you got me ga-ga
Thinking bout your little ya-ya
Got me hotter than a toaster
Cause I need another dose of you, babe
Sweet medicine you, babe

You're so good (so good)
I hadda come back for more (some more)
I hadda have it one more time (one time)
You're so good (so good)
You're so fine (so fine)
That I hadda have it one more time

Lights low, mama
Get your fellow mellow, relax me
Turn on the stereo
Sunset charmer
Your jelly belly dancing attracts me
I said, go, go, go

Firecracker lover
Darling, but you are a mother
Everything between us
Making love, I mean
No go awaying
Well, this time I'm staying

You're so good (so good)
I hadda come back for more (some more)
I hadda have it one more time (one time)
You're so good (so good)
You're so fine (so fine)
That I hadda have it one more time

(Honey, honey) yeah, you're so good
(Honey, honey) yeah, you're so fine
(Honey, honey) yeah, you're all mine

Goody, goody, goody...
You're so good, you're so good
Goody, goody, goody...
You're so fine, you're fine, baby
Goody, goody, goody...
You're all mine, wow, wow, wow
