My world is like a river, as dark as it is deep;
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory
Sweet memories, sweet memories-
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night;
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness, clinging to her memory
Sweet memories, sweet memories-
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm
Sweet memories, sweet memories-
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm
