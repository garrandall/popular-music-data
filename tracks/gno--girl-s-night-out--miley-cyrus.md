Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't, no, I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't and I won't need you


Send out a 911
We're gonna have some fun
Hey boy, you know you better run


'Cause it's a girls night, it's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out, without you
You better hold tight, this girls night's without you
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night


I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows what let go will lead to


You'll hear from everyone
You'll get the 411
Hey boy, you knew this day would come


'Cause it's a girls night, it's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out, without you
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O, let's go


Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you I'm fine
And it's time for me to draw the line
I said, hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you I'm fine
And it's time for me to draw the line


'Cause it's a girls night, it's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out, without you
You better hold tight, this girls night's without you
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O
Let's go; G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night
