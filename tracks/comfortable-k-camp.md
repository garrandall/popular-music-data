Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

Ha, look
Hey, shawty, what it do, what's happenin'?
Peep the way you move I can tell you make it happen
I see you walking around like your feet don't hurt
Shawty just cold like the heat don't work
She independent, you be ballin' on the budget
She ridin' in the fly's all the real niggas love it
Money making mission she just steady chasin' duckets
Shawty, she ain't playin' she just ballin', Denver Nugget

G5 fly, lord oh ma
Can't help to stare, every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of a pie
Tell me you feelin' alright
I'm tryna get with you tonight
I'm with all the shit that you like
I'm with all the shit that you like


Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
Baby, just be comfortable
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

Look, I ain't worried too much bout shawty, no
'Cause I know that she be workin'
In the spare time shawty just countin' dough, we all know she's important
Let me know if you gon' ride for a fella
Me and you together super fly like propellers
I love to her hold her bag and I told her about whatever
Get it while's it's good 'cause nothing last forever

G5 fly, lord oh ma
Can't help to stare, every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of a pie
Tell me you feelin' alright
I'm tryna get with you tonight
I'm with the shit that you like
I'm with the shit that you like


Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
Baby, just be comfortable
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

Let's be real you know you're dealin' with a real one 

I ain't gotta say it all the pretty bitches want it
When I get the chance Imma fuck you like I own it
Feel good comin' from a real nigga, don't it
When we in the bed I just tell her jump up on it
Remi all wet falling right down your spine
I ain't tryna front I just want it from behind
Hope you don't mind for the time girl you mine
Tell me one more time


Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
