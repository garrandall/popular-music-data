I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on
(Lights on, lights on, lights on)
You're the only one I've got my sights on
(Sights on, sights on, sights on)
Type of sex you can never put a price on
(Price on, price on, price on)
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on
(Dice on, dice on, dice on)

And I just want a baby with the right one
(I just want a baby with the right one)
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
(I could never be the one to hide)
'Cause we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)

I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh (Oh)
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh

I'm tired of being home alone
Used to have a girl a day
But I want you to stay (I want you to stay, hey)
You said you might be into girls
Said you're going through a phase
Keeping your heart safe (Keeping your heart safe, oh)

Well baby, you can bring a friend
She can ride on top your face
While I fuck you straight (While I fuck you straight)

And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)

I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh

I'm tired of being home alone
Used to have a girl a day
But I want you to stay (I want you to stay)

I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh

I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe
I can't lose you babe, oh
