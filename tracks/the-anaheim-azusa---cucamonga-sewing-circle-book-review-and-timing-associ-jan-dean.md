For the Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review, and Timing Association
They wear organdy dresses and high-button shoes
They read Playboy magazine and Hot-Rod News
There's Patience Proper and Prudence Prim
You oughta see 'em do the swim

They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too
For a sewing circle and book review
The little old ladies wait in wild anticipation
For the meetings of the double-A-C A-S-S-N
The Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review, and Timing Association

They toot around town in their big Grand Prixes
Sittin' in their bucket seats, shootin' the breeze
You know that all week long they put up jammin' preserves
And on weekends they negotiate curves

They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too
For a sewing circle and book review
The little old ladies wait in wild anticipation
For the meetings of the double-A-C A-S-S-N
The Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review, and Timing Association

The meeting breaks up with a thunderous roar
Then there's a mad mad rush for the big oak door
They run to their cars like the start at LeMans
Then they go spinnin' donuts in the lawns

They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too
For a sewing circle and book review
The little old ladies wait in wild anticipation
For the meetings of the double-A-C A-S-S-N
The Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review, and Timing Association
