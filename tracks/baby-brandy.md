Baby baby baby baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby baby baby baby
Think about you all the time

I guess it's time to say baby, baby
How you make me feel
When you come to my mind
I can't keep my cool baby, baby
I can't hold it inside

I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Tryin' to move in close to get to where you are
I'm not trying to be rude baby, baby
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Oh I'm telling you

Words just ain't enough baby, baby
But that's all I can use to state my intentions
Hope it gets to love baby, baby yeah
It's a perfect situation

Cuz we fit together like a hand in glove
Just to be with you is all I'm thinkin' of
Oh oh yeah
What else can I say baby oh baby
We are alone and I'm singing this song to you

My darling, oh baby
You're all I'm thinking of now
My darling, oh baby
You're all I need right now
Hey, hey, hey
