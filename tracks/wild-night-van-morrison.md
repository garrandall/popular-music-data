As you brush your shoes and stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your memory ever

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright
Ooh-wee
Wild night is calling

All the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin' by just stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright
Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright

The wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Oh, come on out and make romance, yes indeed
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance

The wild night is calling, alright
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Oh, come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance, alright
Come on out and make romance
