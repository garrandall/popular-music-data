A love you hunting for you buck upon the right man
Well, if a loving you looking for you buck upon the right man

To satisfy her soul you know that she wants a man. But...

The vibe that's flowing through me makes me feel alright

Shabba Ranks:

You have it in a your mind fi come thrill me wid it
A going lay down and make you thrill me wid it
Because thrilling that is my favourite habit
And when me lay down you know me nah run from it

They call me Mr Loverman, they call me Mr Lover
Mr Loverman, they call me Mr Lover
Them call me Mr Loverman, they call me Mr Lover

A woman take a trip, she's coming from England
To satisfy her soul you know that she wants a man, boops

A going make you explode just like a bomb
Every hour, every minute man, every second
They call me Mr Loverman, they call me Mr Lover

Chevelle Franklin:
