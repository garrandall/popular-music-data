Je ne t'aime plus, mon amour, (hey!!)

The love I have a woman, it is rich and pure, (who this?)

Woman if you want this loving, then give it to your guy love

In my world you are my...again...jah... again...

Woman in the world love them familiar
With sweet, and no who is no supper long, it is silly
Now I give them girl, them none affi a baby
Girls are so want me, but them cannot trace me
In a bedroom Shabba Ranks killing easily

Boom, boom, boom, woman you make me sweat 'cause you are so sexy!
Boom, boom, boom, come again, come again!! Let's go make a baby??...(Shabba!)
