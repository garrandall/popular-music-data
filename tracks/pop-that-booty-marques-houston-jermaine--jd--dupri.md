MH and Pied Pied Pied Pi Piper
MH and Pied Pied Pied Pi Piper
We get the girls so so hyper
We make 'em say dad a dad a da


Pulled up to the party
In a black Lexus jeep (yeah)
Hop up out the whip I'm feelin' freaky (oh)
All the ladies comes surrounding me
Cause I'm so important like the H.N.I.C.
This one girl she making my body feen
I'm f'ed up on hypnotic and ice cream
So I stepped to her like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the jeweler


Mami won't you come take a ride with me (oh)
Be the girl of my fantasies
But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby won't you come pop ya booty for me (0hh)


I love the way you move so sexy (oh oh)
I love when you are all up on me
But there's one thing I have to see
Is the way you pop that booty (pop it for me)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you all up on me (oh oh)
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty


MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper (come on)
MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
We get the girls so so hyper (come on)
We make 'em say dad a dad a dada a da


Girl shake that ah like there's no rules
Love the way you move in those high heel shoes
So pop your booty like Beyonce'
Got me falling crazy in love with you
Making me wanna say
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Girl you shaped like a coke bottle
So let me see you pop your thing full throttle


I love the way you move so sexy (love to see, yeah)
I love when you are all up on me
But there's one thing I have to see (one thing I have to see)
Is the way you pop that booty (is the way you pop it for me,yeah )
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you all up on me (oh oh oh oh)
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty

I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like whoa
I bet it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like whoa
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm sturring
But I gotta no 1 thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you grindin
more than the Clipse
I aint never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is
What you doing is major, the way you keep
Shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya


Mami dancing all on me
She's not wearing any panties (ok)
I like it when she call me dadda
The way she pops it like she from Jamaica


I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you are all up on me
But there's one thing I have to see (the one thing I have to see)
Is the way you pop that booty (is the way you pop that booty)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you all up on me
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty
