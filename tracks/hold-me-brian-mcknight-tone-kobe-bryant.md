Brian McKnight, Trackmasters (ooooh) 
Here we go, Kobe, Brian McKnight 
 
Yeah, g's are 
 
Trackmasters (mmmm) 
Uh, red hot, baby 
Honey, listen up (listen) 
The lies and pain, it's enough (it's enough) 
End it, exit, leave homes alone (uh, huh) 
Got my Tone, the New York Giant man's a client 
I'm the president (yeah) 
Money, long like jail sentences 
Sentences, poetic, him? (Him?) 
Forget it (forget it) 
Amnesia, I need ya 
I need a women like you 
I know you wanna go (wanna go) 
Your girlfriends say (say) 
That you wanna leave (leave) 
Here's my chauffer (uh, huh) 
Give him his keys to his V's 
Now honey, you can ride me 
 
Remember way back when, when I first met ya 
Didn't wanna sweat ya, wanted you to put me on 
1-5-5 at the Rucker's 
All them other suckers tried the game 
I knew you were the one, oh yeah 
Well, I know you think about me (you think about me) 
But I don't know what you're waitin' to see 
Girl, I want you in my life 
Let me show you right 
You're the only one that matters to me (c'mon) 
Girl, it's about time 
 - It's time you put me on 
Right here's where you belong 
Don't be afraid to hold me 
I'm here and it's OK 
There's nothing else to say 
Don't be afraid to hold me 
When you were alone that night 
I called you from Jamaica 
You were listening to "I'll Take Her" 
And I know I made ya smile (mm, hmm) 
But I ain't on the shining tip 
But I know you like that flossy shit 
I just want to hold you for a while, oh, girl 
Well I know you dream about me (I know you dream about me) 
But I don't know what you're waitin' to see 
Girl, I want you in my life 
Let me show you right 
You're the only one that matters to me (c'mon) 
It's about time 

 
KB, sing it, Kobe 
 
Your love's a sword slicing gently through my body 
Burn so sweet, blood boils when you speak (yeah) 
Makes me weak but I refuse to weep 
Yet when I sleep I feel tears tricklin' down my cheek (c'mon) 
Stay strong, pride telling me move on 
My heart's fightin' me, forcin' me to hold on 
Yours forever, fell for you beyond measure 
Pure as ever, fazed by sins of treasure 
 
Tonight's the night 
(Tonight's the night, tonight) 
Let's make it tight baby 
(Let's make it tight, tonight) 
Leave all our cares 
(Leave all our cares behind) 
Tonight's the night 
(Tonight's the night, tonight) 
Hey 
 
Here we go
