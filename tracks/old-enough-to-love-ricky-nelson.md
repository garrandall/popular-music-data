Higher than the mountains, taller than the trees
Bigger than the moon above, deeper than the seas
Oh, that's how I feel now my love is real
Yeah, I'm old enough to love

Stronger than the winds that blow, brighter than the sun
Greater than the stars that glow, you're my only one
Holding you, holding you close now at last I know
Yes, I'm old enough to love

Higher than the mountains, taller than the trees
Bigger than the moon above, deeper than the seas
Oh, that's how I feel now my love is real
Yes, I'm old enough to love
Old enough to love
