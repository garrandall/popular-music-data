Go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
Southside
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back


Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Flint water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place ya order (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking Bron's set, 40 pointers
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)


I'm a young gunner, young gunner, young gunner, a nigga just wet up
We don't got no time for these boys, just shut up and bet up
The Rollie on Ric Flair, my wrist is just wet up (Whoo)
The plug just called like "What up?", nigga don't let up (Let's go)
The diamonds are yellow today, you gotta catch up, yeah
Money on the floor with these hoes, these niggas can't pose with us (Can't pose, no)
How the fuck you sound old? You never grown with us
Diamonds in the ear got big, look nigga, I told you (They dripping wet)
Flood that Patek in the sea and throw her that straw (Throw her that straw)
All these bitches they diggin' him with a golden shovel
Secret service, they taking me through the side door (Side, let's go)
And I promise I can fold with a blindfold


Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Flint water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place ya order (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking LeBron's set, 40 pointer
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)


Baguettes on the edge of my neck, I never settle for less (Nah)
Put her on Percy and Act, I'ma just fuck and forget (Smash)
Mansion that sit on the hill, after my last arrest
Niggas out here in the field, don't need a mask or vest (Brr)
Ah, back to back Lambos, repeat it, you like to run when it's heated (Run) (Back to back)
AR-15 with the coolant, just in case it get too heated
Hop on the wave and drown, my momma been Cartier bracelet down (Momma)
Ah, face it down, dirty in my soda, I hate the brown (Uh)
Hold it down 'cause the plug is illegal
Ridin' 'round with a dub and a eagle (Brr)
I heard that money get evil, prayin' to God to keep me from demons (God)
She lost in the vibe surrounded by stars, we got her sucking on semen (Ugh)
You gotta survive, ain't sparing no lives
F&N pop at your beanie (Ayy)


Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Flint water)
Ayy, what kinda shooters is them? Just place ya order (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking LeBron's set, 40 pointers
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done out did yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch Addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)


We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We just wanna go snatch a nigga's sunroof
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back
