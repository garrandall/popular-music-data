Come on

Come along
Come on and get up, get down

And get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

Rise, rise, rise
Shake your hips
(Get up) let me see you

Let me see your tight wire come alive

You ain't too old
(You ain't too hip) (get up)
I ain't asking for a cartwheel
(A somersault) or no flip

I just want you to

And get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

Now look at mama
(Look at mama)
She'll tear you up (get up)
To make sure you feel the cool
I get to turn the music up

Clap your hands
Stomp your feet (get up)
Keep in time with the music
Get on down with the beat

I just want you to

And get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

Come on

Come on and get down
Get up and get down
Come on, girl, oh, oh

And get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet
And get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet
