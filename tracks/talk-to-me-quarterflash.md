There's some out there tonight
Who's lost and lonely, too
There's a heart beating just with mine
There's a voice in the air
But it just can't get through
I'm hoping that someday I'll find someone
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door...
Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart
There's a song in the air,
But I can't hear the words
There's a promise that's never made
There's a voice in the streets
That no one's ever heard
I'm hoping I'll hear it someday calling...
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door...

Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart

Somewhere there's a voice that's calling
Someone who's alone and falling
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door...
Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart
