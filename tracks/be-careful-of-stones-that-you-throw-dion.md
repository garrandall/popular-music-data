So be careful of stones that you throw

Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's low
So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw

A neighbor was passin' my garden one time
She stopped and I knew right away
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say

"You know, that girl down the street
Should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to my child or me"
My neighbor then smiled and I thought

Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's low
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lyin' still

The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
"Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet?"
I covered the crushed broken body and said
"The bad girl who lived down the street"

So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw
