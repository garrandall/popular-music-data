You can't hide it from me
Admit it baby
'Cause I'm wise to your disguise
I've seen you love me with your eyes

Even if you think I'm a fool and I just can't tell
Then you don't know me well
Won't you come over here and break the ice
It would be so nice

It's what you want when you're around me
You're a little bit shy, and I feel the need
And I can tell that you're happy you found me
Just give it up...


Why wait around when you know what you're feeling (give it up)
I look through your eyes
I can see that you want somebody (give it up)
It could feel so good to get into it.
Give it up! Give it up! You want it baby.
Give it up! Give it up! You know you got me.
Come on, come on, come on and give it up.

I can't, I can't lie to you
Now we can all tell stories so come over here and love me. Uh-huh
Even if you think I'm a fool and I just can't tell
Sorry I know you well.
And I know you will

Come over here and love me
It's what you want when you're around me
You're a little bit shy, and I feel the need
And I can tell that you're happy you found me
Just give it up...



So dream your way into my life
'Cause baby I'll give you tonight
I'll bring all your pictures to life
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
Give it up... (oh God) Give it up... Just give it up...Give it up

Give it up! Give it up (Yeah!)
Give it up! Give it up!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, give it up
Give it up! Won't you give it up baby tonight?
