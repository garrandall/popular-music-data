I can't sleep at night, tossing and turning
I turn on the light then while it's burning
I think of all the things that we do
And all the reasons why I love you

Tossing and turning
I'm tossing and turning all night

In my memory there is confusion
Was it you and me or an illusion?
Was I really holding you tight?
Did I really kiss you goodnight?

Tossing and turning
I'm tossing and turning all night

Whatcha gonna do at night?
Nobody to hold you tight, are you lonely?
Don't you know that I get lonely, too?
And I'm blaming you

When we maybe tomorrow
You will goodbye tomorrow
We'll be lovers just as before
I guess, I'll never sleep anymore

Tossing and turning
I'm tossing and turning all night
