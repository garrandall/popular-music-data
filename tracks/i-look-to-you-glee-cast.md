As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you
Yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you
You

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Mmm
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm goin' make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you
Yeah
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you
Ohh
And when melodies are gone
Yeah
In you I hear a song

I look to you (My levees are broken)
Levees are broken (My walls are coming)
Yeah
Wall come down (Tumbling down on me)
Coming down on me (The rain is falling)
Rain is falling (Defeat is calling)
'feat is calling (I need you to set me free)

Need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you (To you)
I look to you, ohhh, ooooh (Oh-oh-oh)
And when melodies are gone (Melodies are gone)
In you I hear a song

I look to you
Yeah
I look to you
Ooooh
I look to you
