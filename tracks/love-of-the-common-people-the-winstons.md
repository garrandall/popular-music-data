Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
Tears from your little sister
Cryin' because she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by
Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
And mama's gonna love her just as much as she can...
And she can
It's a good thing you don't have busfare
It would fall through the whole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
You gotta walk into town to find a job
Tryin' to keep your hands warm when the hole in your shoe
Let's the snow come through and chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
And mama's gonna love you just as much as she can...
And she can
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Just take 'em in stride
For family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray it's making it strong where you belong
And we're living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can...
And she can
And we're living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
Livin' in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
Livin' in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can...
And she can
