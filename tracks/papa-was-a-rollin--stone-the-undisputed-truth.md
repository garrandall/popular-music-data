It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
Papa died when we was very young
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up and said, son


Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone


Hey, mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And mama, there's some bad talk goin' around town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Hey, heard some talk about papa doing some storefront preaching
Talking 'bout saving souls and all the time leeching
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just looked up and


Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone


Mama, mama, mama
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal to pay his bills
I wanna know, mama
Folks say papa never was much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
With tear-filled eyes, mama  say


Papa was a rolling stone, son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone, very alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone, very alone
