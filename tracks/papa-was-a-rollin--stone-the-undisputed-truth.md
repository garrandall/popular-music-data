It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day when my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

All he left us was alone
All he left us

Papa

Papa

All he left us was
Absolutely
Absolutely nothing

All he left us was
Absolutely nothing
All he left us was
Absolutely nothing

War, huh, come on ya'll
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh, come on
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing, nothing
War, huh, say it again
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh, come on
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing

Oh, war, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives

War, huh, say it again
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh, come on
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh (Papa was)
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
Absolutely nothing
