(I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together, and your hands together
And give me some of that old soul clapping)

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

If you took your love to somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

Every day was something new
You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

I want to thank you (thank you)
Thank you (oh, baby)
Thank you baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby (I gotta be thanking)
Got to say

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)

You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)

Thank you (thank you, baby)
Baby (got to thank you)
Baby (oh, baby)
Thank! I've! Got! I've got to (thank you baby)
Thank you baby (oh baby)
