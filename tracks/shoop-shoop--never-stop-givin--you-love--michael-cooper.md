Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Now it's nice to know
With you, I'm a needed soul
Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Yes, baby

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
And it's plain to see
With me, you wanna be
Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Love taught me
It's you that I need
Now I know I can
Never stop giving you love

You know you're on my mind
Sugar, all the time
And now I know I can
Never stop giving good love

Oh, baby

Now I want you, girl
I believe in your heart
I can't believe it that i'm
Living my life without you

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Never stop giving you love
Sweet, sweet thing
Sweet thing
Never stop giving you love

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Aww, never stop giving you love
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
It's all right tonight
If you squeeze my body some

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
We'll go round and round
Til my love comes tumbling down

You know I'm on the phone
With you all night long
And now I know I can
Never stop giving good love

Oh, baby, love it to me
Love it to me, love it to me
Love it to me, love it to me
Love it to me, love it to me alone

Oh, baby, sweet baby
Oh, baby I want you, girl
I believe in your heart
I can't believe it that i'm
Living my life without you

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Never stop giving good love
Come on, baby, come on, baby
Come on, baby

Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Never stop giving good love
Come on, baby, come on, baby
Come on, baby

It's you and me, it's you and me
It's all right tonight
Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
You and me...
