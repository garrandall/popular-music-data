Why do bitches lie so much?
I really tried to figure that shit out or nah
I really can't figure it out
Why fucking lie
Dumb-ass bitch

Should've left you where I met you bitch you fucked up
You hit the jackpot with me bitch you lucked up
But you wanted other bitches got me fucked up
But you got me over here screaming fuck love
You never loved me and I see it in your eyes tho
I was dumb enough believing all your lies hoe
Said she was just a friend but now she in your thighs yo
I tried to turn a fucking hoe into a wife bro

Damn bitch you then fucked up bad
Gone be ringin up my phone when you see what you had
And ima block, scan, delete and say oops my bad
And when she fucking breaks your heart I hope you cry and you sad
I hope she uses you for money hope she sucks you dry
I hope she leaves you and don't tell you, you won't understand why
I hope she textin other bitches while you layin at night
I hope you cryin everyday while she playin ya life

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

You fucking bitch

Gone and talk yo shit
Said I ain't do a thang for you girl you soft as shit
Stop fuckin walkin round boujee like you bought the shit
I fucking gave you what you got bitch you off as shit!

Switchin up when you got your own
Girl leave me alone
Say you grown
Playin on my phone
Gone end up alone
Cause every-time that I come over you be tryna fuck
But you got a girlfriend bitch you wild as fuck

I don't trust you
Look at what you're doing to your girl
Yea you showin her off, but tryna lick my pearl
And when I fucking decline you claim that she's your world
And how you never ever felt this with no other girl
Bitch

I'm fuckin tired of you hoe I really wanted to be proud of you hoe
They see your colors cause your attitude hoe
You never showed no fucking gratitude yo!

With all the fake shit girl you ain't shit you don't make shit
I'm patient
Cause karma coming for you and I'm waitin
You bakin? You smokin now girl like damn you changing
Yo faces, like what you on girl you actin basic
You wasted from every Friday to every Monday
You tainted
Hoping you change girl like maybe someday
Erase it, cause what we had girl it wasn't nothin
You said I was so easy to get over bitch you frontin hoe

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

You say I'm weird?
Somebody come get this weird ass bitch for some years
Bitch fuck you
You said you felt nothing bitch you ain't shit bitch cheers

To your future if you had one you really are the mad one
Texting me you hate me and your new girl is amazing
And you gonna have a baby and she movin in that's crazy
Whew
Back with her a week later
That's foul
But I'm not gonna do shit cause karma comin around
While I'm catchin flights and bookin shit you bummin around
I would be happy but you treat me like a bum on the ground

You said that you would never do youtube with another
You been actin fuckin shady ever since you got a lover
And you claimin that you love her and you puttin her out
Don't be surprised when she leave you
When she get all the clout
Bitch

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

I was blind
Everybody told me what it was
But I ain't fuckin listen cause I thought I was in love
I wish I never met you bitch you fuckin kill my buzz
You ain't have a fuckin reason you played me because you could

You fuckin bitch

Never again will I ever lose myself in no relationship
If you can't commit, if you don't like me how I am, then bitch
Fuck you
Go find somebody on your level, cause you ain't on mine

I wish I never met your ass
