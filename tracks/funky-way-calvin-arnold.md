Said you knocked me down
Well, you kicked me round
Say, I'm the biggest fool
In this town

Said I'll do my best
Ooh, gotta treat you right
Let you go out
You just stay out all night

Ain't that a funky way
To treat somebody
(Funky way to treat me)
Ain't that a funky
Way to treat me
(Funky way to treat me)
Ain't that a funky way to
Treat a good loving
Sweet loving man like me

(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is) uh huh
(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is)

Said I fix your meals
Clean your clothes
Said when you take
A notion, girl
You keep me outdoors
(Out in the cold)?
And I bring you my pay
Then you don't wanna see me
No more 'til next day

(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is) uh huh
(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is)

It's a crying shame the way
She dogged me around
And I ain't got the nerve, girl
To put you down

When I got home
I knocked on my door
Thenyou try to tell me
I don't live here no more

(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is) uh huh
(Yes, it is) all right
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(Yes, it is)

What you doing to me
(Funky way to treat me)
You treat me so bad
(Funky way to treat me)
You make me said
(Funky way to treat me)...
