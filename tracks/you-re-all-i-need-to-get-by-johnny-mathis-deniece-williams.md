With Deniece Williams

You're all I need to get by
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you Dedicate my life for you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure nough, that's enough
You're all, you're All I need to get by
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need to get by

You're all I need to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goa
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination

You're all, you're All I need to get by
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need to get by
