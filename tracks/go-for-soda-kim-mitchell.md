Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody drowns and nobody dies

So we're in one of our blue moods
You wanna have it your way and I want it mine
All this debating goin' 'round in our blue mood 
Makes me thirsty for love

(Might as well) Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
(Might as well) Might as well go for a soda
Nobody drowns and nobody dies

Life seems to be a bomb inside of your head
Well, the bomb in my head is love
All this debating goin' 'round in our blue mood 
Makes me thirsty for love

(Might as well) Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries (Nobody hurts, nobody cries)
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody drowns and nobody dies

Might as well go for a soda
It's better than slander, it's better than lies
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
Might as well go for a soda

Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody drowns and nobody dies

Might as well go for a soda
It's better than slander, it's better than lies
Might as well go for a soda
(Might as well, oh yeah)

Might as well go for a soda
(Oh yeah, nobody hurts, nobody cries)
Might as well go for a soda
(Oh yeah, nobody drowns, nobody dies)
Might as well go for a soda
(It's better than slander, it's better than lies)
Might as well go for a soda
