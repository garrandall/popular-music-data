Rainbow
Look me up look me down
Rainbow
You were fun to have around
I was dreamin'
Of the love I had to share
Never thinkin'
You were here you were there

Not a word, not a sound, could see or even feel the ground
A pot of gold, I was sold, by the way you let it fly

Rainbow
Look me up look me down
Rainbow
You were fun to have around
I was dreamin'
Of the love I had to share
Never thinkin'
You were here you were there

Rainbow
Look me up look me down
Rainbow
You were fun to have around
Now I'm changing
For the better for the day
Feel like singing
All the colours you convey

Come on home, keep me warm
And love me till the new day's born
And I pray, you will stay
For ever in my eyes
