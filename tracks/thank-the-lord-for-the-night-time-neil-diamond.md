Daytime turns me off,
And I don't mean maybe
Nine to five
Ain't takin' me where I'm bound
When it's done,
I run out to see my baby
We got groovin'
When the sun goes down

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

I'll talk about plans now
Baby, I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out
The way it should
Talk about money, girl,
I ain't got any
Seems like just one time
I'm feeling good

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

Seems like just one time
I'm feeling good
I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you
Thank the Lord for the night time
Thank the Lord for you
