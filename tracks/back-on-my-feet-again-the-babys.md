I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drownin' my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough

You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles
And the way that you came every night
Don't know what you got, but I'm sure glad I found you
Could be wrong but it sure feels right

And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

Surprised at myself for the way that I feel
So happy that you're here with me
Some women I've known, have left me with nothing
But I guess that was just meant to be

And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

I was down for the count
I was down, I was beat, I was cryin'
I was cornered and hurt
I was hidin' my face, sick of tryin'

I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drowning my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough

And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

Yeah, here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

Ohyeah, here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

Here I am, yeah
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
