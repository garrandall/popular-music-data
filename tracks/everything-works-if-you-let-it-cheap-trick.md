(Alternate intro)
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Let it in your heart

Everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
Yeah, everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart

She is the girl of his dreams
He wants her, he thinks "forget it"
He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying
So lonesome for love he feels like dying
But don't stop the dream
He can fix it, I know he can
He's the world's world's greatest at the work that he does
When he moves on down the line

Everything works if you let it
Everything works if you let it
Everything works if you let it
Let it in your heart

She is the girl of his dreams
He wants her, he thinks "forget it"
He'd love to look inside her heart and see if she agrees
But don't stop the dream
He can fix it, I know he can
He's good, he's great at the work that he does
And there's magic in the air

Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Let it in your heart

Good times, bad times, don't know what to do
Half the time and all the time, don't know if it's true
Someday, somewhere, he'll know if it's true
She'll look inside her heart and then decide it's really you
Oh

Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Let it in your heart

Everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
Everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
Everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
Yeah, everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
