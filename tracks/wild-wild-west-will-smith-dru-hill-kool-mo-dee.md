Wild Wild West, Jim West, desperado, rough rider
No you don't want nada
None of this, gun in this, brotha runnin this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step with flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With all of this, from the start of this
Runnin the game, James West tamin the west so remember the name
Now who ya gonna call?

Not the G.B.'s

Now who you gonna call?



If you have a riff with people wanna bust
Break out before you get bumrushed at the (Wild Wild West)
When I roll into the (Wild Wild West)
When I stroll into the (Wild Wild West)
When I bounce into the (Wild Wild West) Sisqo, Sisqo

We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West

Now, now, now, now once upon a time in the west
Mad man lost his damn mind in the west
Loveless, givin up a dime, nothin' less
Now I must put his behind to the test (can you feel me)
Then through the shadows, in the saddle, ready for battle
Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all the riffin' ya did
Front and center, now where your lip at kid?
Who dat is? A mean brotha, bad for your health
Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
Got mad weapons too, ain't tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me, this champion
When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is
I'm the quickest as they is, did I say I'm the slickest they is
So if you barking up the wrong tree we comin, don't be startin nothin
Me and my partner gonna test your chest, Loveless
Can't stand the heat then get out the Wild Wild West

We going straight to (when I roll into the) the Wild Wild
West (when I stroll into the)
We going straight to (when I bounce into the)the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West

To any outlaw tryin to draw, thinkin you're bad
Any draw on West best with a pen and a pad
Don't even think about it, six gun, weighin a ton
10 paces and turn, just for fun, son
Up till sundown, rolling around
See where the bad guys are to be found and make 'em lay down
The defenders of the west
Crushin on pretenders in the west
Don't mess with us cuz we're in the (Wild Wild West)

We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West, come on
(Wild Wild West) When I roll into the
(Wild Wild West)When I stroll into the
We going straight to the Wild Wild West (the Wild Wild West)
(Wild, Wild West) whoo, uh
(Wild Wild West) ha ha ha ha
(Wild Wild West) uh Dru, Dru
(Wild Wild West) I done done it again y'all done done it again
(Wild Wild West) ha ha ha ha
(Wild Wild West) Big Will, Dru Hill, uh
(Wild Wild West) Big Will, Dru Hill ha ha ha ha
(Wild Wild West) *the Wild Wild West*
(Wild Wild West) uh
(Wild Wild West) one time
(Wild Wild West) uh
(Wild Wild West) *the wild wild west*
Bring in the heat, bring in the heat, what? (Wild Wild West)
(Wild Wild West) uh can't stop the bumrush
*the Wild Wild* (the Wild Wild West)
