Preacher told me last Sunday mornin'
Son, you better start livin' right
You need to quit the women and whiskey
And carrying on all night

Don't you wanna hear him call your name
When you're standin' at the pearly gates
I told the preacher, "Yes I do"
But I hope they don't call today
I ain't ready

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Have a mansion high above the clouds
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now

Said preacher maybe you didn't see me
Throw an extra twenty in the plate
There's one for everything I did last night
And one to get me through today
Here's a ten to help you remember
Next time you got the good Lord's ear
Say I'm comin' but there ain't no hurry
I'm havin' fun down here
Don't you know that

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now

Someday I want to see those streets of gold in my halo
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so

Everybody wanna go to heaven
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

Everybody wanna go to heaven
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now
I think I speak for the crowd
