You're my number one deejay
Oh, my number one man
I can't lose with the songs you use
You get me up to dancin', get me on my way
Cheer me up with the latest, greatest hits of today
Oh, oh

You're my number one deejay
With the number one songs of today, yeah, yeah
With the number one sounds in the great big U.S.A
Number one deejay with the number one sounds of today
Oh, I like it like that
Number one deejay with the number one songs of the day, oh
My number one deejay with the number one hits of today

Can't enough of that funky stuff
Makes me wanna clap, move my feet
To the rhythm and the sound of the disco beat
Ah, boogie on down, boogie oogie woogie
Mr. Deejay, I got your number
Right here in my heart, you're number one
Oh love your style, love your style, yeah
Play it for me, la la la la la la la

(Repeat Verse 1 and 2)

Love your style, love your style, yeah
Play it for me...
