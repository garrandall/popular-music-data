Well, I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way
You make feel inside

Though the meaning maybe simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried

I need you and I couldn't
Live a day without you
I need you more than
Anyone could ever know
I need you and I wanna
Build my world around you
I need you, I need you

Well I sang the words and realized
It's all been said before
So I tried a different line
That meant the same

But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to
Say it once again

I need you and I couldn't
Live a day without you
I need you more than
Anyone could ever know
I need you and I wanna
Build my world around you
I need you, I need you

I need you and I couldn't
Live a day without you
I need you more than
Anyone could ever know
Baby, baby, baby
I need you and I wanna
Build my world around you
I need you, I need you

I need you and I couldn't
Live a day without you
I need you more than
Anyone could ever know
I need you and I wanna
Build my world around you
I need you, I need you

I need you and I couldn't
Live a day without you
I need you
