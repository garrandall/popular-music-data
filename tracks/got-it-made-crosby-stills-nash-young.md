One morning I woke up and I knew you were really gone
A new day, a new way, and new eyes to see the dawn
Go your way, I'll go mine and carry on

The sky is clearing and the night has cried enough
The sun, he comes, the world to soften up
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice but to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able to sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which we get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues and carry on

Carry on, love is coming, love is coming to us all

Where are you going now my love? Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness? Will you bring me sorrow?
Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?

Girl, when I was on my own, chasing you down
What was it made you run, trying your best just to get around?
The questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?
