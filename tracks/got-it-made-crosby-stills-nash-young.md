Know you are a friend of mine, babe you been gone
An awful long time. You might remember me, I tried
To set your soul free.

Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done

Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun.

I'm gonna be missing you, even though I understand that you're not through.
Go on take it day by day, seems like I lost you anyway.

Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done
Done
Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun.

When you came to save the world I caused your
Dreams to fade,
I couldn't do what you did and rained on your parade.

Glad that you got it made.
Glad that you got it made.

Hard set of changes, for anyone that I know,
You're gonna make it, make it, make it better for you
And me and anyone else you know.

Just don't forget me, I'll be there when you're done
And in the meantime, meantime, you'll get to know
Yourself
So don't judge anyone else, anyone.

It doesn't matter I don't mind, I'm sure that you'll
Remember sometime, even if you never do,
All you need to worry `bout now is you.

Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your
Last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done
Done
Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun.

Glad that you got it made.
