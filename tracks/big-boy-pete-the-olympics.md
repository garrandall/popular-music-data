Big Boy Pete
The Olympics
Arvee Records Single #595
Pop Chart #50 May 23, 1960
(Don 'Sugarcane' Harris and Dewey Terry)
(also recorded by authors Don and Dewey for Specialty Records #659 - was uncharted)

Piano Intro

WOO!

The joint was a jumpin' on the corner (yeah-yeah)
Down on a Honky Tonk Street (yeah-yeah)
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac (yeah-yeah)
And out stepped a cat named Pete

Diamonds on-a every finger (yeah-yeah)
Wore a tailor-made suit
He smoked a black cigar (so what?)
He wore a Stetson hat (yeah)
He wore a pair-a cowboy boots

He busted on through the doorway (yeah-yeah)
Bad as-a he could be (yeah-yeah)
He pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'My name is a Big Boy Pete'

The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
A-over in the corner stood-a, Bad Man Brown

Brown smiled a grin, he said, 'My friend'
('You take your 3 steps forward and I'm 'onna-a, clue you in')

Now Pete said, 'A look it, here buddy' (yeah-yeah)
'Fore I tan your hide' (yeah-yeah)
I got a forty-five to keep me alive
Seven bullets on my side

Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter right on out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth!
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
(Pete took his Stetson hat and beat the scene)

Now if you're ever down on the corner (yeah-yeah)
Down on-a Honky Tonk Street (yeah-yeah)
Don't mess with Brown (yeah-yeah)
He'll cut you down
Take a message from-a Big Boy Pete

Umm-umm, umm umm umm (yeah-yeah)
Umm-umm, umm umm umm (yeah-yeah)

FADES-
Umm, umm, umm
