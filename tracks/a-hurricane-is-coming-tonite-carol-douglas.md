(Hurricane) I can feel it
(Hurricane) feel it coming
(Hurricane) yeah, it's coming now


A hurricane is coming tonight, baby
A hurricane is coming tonight
And the water and winds
Are gonna drown all your sins
A hurricane is coming
And I swear that it's true

? Is our house, baby
? Is our house
Gonna shake up and down
For all your messing around
Yeah, a hurricane is coming
And it's looking for you

Baby, you know that I gave you
Everything with a smile
And you took it all
And had yourself a ball
Watching my temperature go up
And my barometer fall


Honey, you call me your lover
Your only sweet nature's child
But once you're outside my door
You were looking for more
So now I'm gathering my forces
Just to even the score

(Hurricane) I can feel it
(Hurricane) feel it coming
(Hurricane) yeah, it's coming now

(Hurricane) I can feel it
(Hurricane) feel it coming
There's a hurricane
Heading up the street, honey
(Hurricane) yeah, it's coming now
It's gonna wash you away


? Is our house, baby
? Is our house
Gonna shake up and down
For all your messing around
Yeah, a hurricane is coming
And it's looking for you
