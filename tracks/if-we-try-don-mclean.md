When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. Just the thought that we 
might meet creates anticipation.

Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to 
know. Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night...and I don't know if 
it'll work out right...but somehow I think that it just might...if we try.

Faces come and faces go in circular rotation. But something yearns within to 
grow beyond infatuation. 

Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to 
know. Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind...cause I see love as just a 
state of mind...and who knows what it is that we might find...if we try.

You're walking a different direction from most people I've met. You're givin' 
me signs of affection I don't usually get. I don't want you to pledge your 
future the future's not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let 
me watch while you live.

'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. And just the 
thought that we might meet creates anticipation.

Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to 
know. Well I've been thinking about you day and night...and I don't know if it 
will work out right...but somehow I think that it just might...if we try. 
Somehow I think that it just might if we try. Yes somehow I think that it just 
might if we try.

Note - Don would often change the last chorus when he performed the song live. 
The words were something like "Won't you look my way once before you go and my 
eyes will say what you ought to know. It'd be so nice to see it all work 
out...cause that's what fantasies are all about..."
