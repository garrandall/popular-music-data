On just an ordinary day, no reason, no reason for a fuss
But even though, it isn't Christmas, let us love one another, let us love
On just a day, just a day, no special name, no pretty presents, pretty presents to exchange
Make it a good day, just the same
Let us love one another, let us love

No special greeting, special greeting for the day
No happy easter, no merry christmas, only how are you today
Make it a good day, anyway
Let us help one another, help your neighbor, he's your brother
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us love, love one another

Help your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, now let us love
One another,
Help your neighbor, he might not feel so good sometimes,
Let us love, love one another, help your neighbor,
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us help, help one another
Love your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, let us love
Let us love, let us love, love one another, help your neighbor
He's your brother, let us love one another, let us love
