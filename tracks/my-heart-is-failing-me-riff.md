Here come the tear drops falling again
Seems like the night has come to an end
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failing me

When you were here I knew what to do
Now I just waste time thinking of you
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failing me

My heart lost in emotion
I'm shipwrecked out on the ocean
I wait hoping you'll come back to me

Never a single day passes by
When I don't feel a part of me die
I wonder why, I feel like my heart is failing me

I remember, the day that I found you
How I long to still be around you
So I wait hoping you'll come back to me
Darling I can't explain it
I just can't live my life without you
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failing me

If anybody should see her
Tell her how much, I need her
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failin' me

My heart lost in emotion
I'm shipwrecked out on the ocean
I wait hoping you'll come back to me...sweet baby

I'm dying, I wonder why
Seems like the night has come to an end
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failing me

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
I wonder why I feel like my heart is failing me

(Feel like my heart is failing me) Tell me why, baby
(I wonder why is failing..failing me) Please baby oh yeah
(I wonder why is failing..failing me)
(I wonder why is failing..failing me)
