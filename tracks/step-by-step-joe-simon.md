Oh yeah Step by step
I've got to get close to you
Step by step
I've got to get to know you - oh yeah You came into my life, my gods have the rain falling from above *And I knew when I first saw you
You were the one for me to love
But as sudden as you came, oh, you vanished into the night - yeah
I knew my life wouldn't be complete
Oh, without you to hold me tight Step by step
I've got to get close to you
Step by step
I've got to get to know you My friends all tell me
Tell me you're a woman of the street
Oh, but to me, baby, you're all my eyes can ever see
If we had one night together
I'll make you understand
That I need your love, baby
And I surely wanna be your man
Let me tell you, honey Step by step
I've got to get close to you
Step by step
Oh, I've got to get to know you - oh yeah Oh yeah - oh yeah Step by step
