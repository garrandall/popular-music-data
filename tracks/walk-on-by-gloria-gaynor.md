You always said my eyes
Were the windows of my soul
You could always fill my love
And pain without been told
I never knew how, but I don't
Even dare to look at you now.

So, if you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we leave
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry, oh baby,
Walk on by, ohdarling
Please, Walk on by,
I don't wanna you to see me cry
Walk on by, please, please
Baby, baby don't stop...

So, if you ever love
Look the other way
There is anything left to say
Anyway...

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goobye, oh baby
Walk on by, ohsugar
Walk on by...(baby, baby don't stop)

Baby, baby don't stop

Walk on by...ub...eh
Walk on by...
Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by...uuh baby
Walk on by...uuh sugar
Walk on by... walk on by

I don't want to see me cry
Walk on by, walk on by...
All the tears that I have cry...
I don't have nothing left to say...
Please take your head... look the other way...
Wow...wow...wow...walk on by...
Walk on by...
