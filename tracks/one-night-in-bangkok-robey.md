Bangkok, Oriental setting
And the city don't know
What the city is getting

The creme de la creme
Of the chess world
In a show with everything
But Yul Brynner

Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean spa
Had the chess boys in it
All change, don't you know that
When you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines
Or Hastings, or, or this place

(CHORUS)
One night in Bangkok
And the world's your oyster
The bars are temples
But the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in
Every golden cloister
And if you're lucky
Then the god's a she
I can feel an angel
Sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down
Over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore
It's really such a pity
To be looking at the board
Not looking at the city

Waddaya mean
You seen one crowded
Polluted, stinking town

Tea, girls, warm amd sweet
Some are set up in the
Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd
You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's
Among the purest
I get my kicks above
The waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok
Makes a hard man humble
Not much between
Despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful
With your company
I can feel the devil
Walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha

And thank God I'm only
Watching the game, controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use
Would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

One night in Bangkok
And the world's your oyster
The bars are temples
But the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in
Every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One night in Bangkok
Makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
