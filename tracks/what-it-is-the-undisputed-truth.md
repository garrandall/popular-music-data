What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky

Did I hear somebody say "Down with the system"?
Shut your mouth
Or I'll take your toy away
Children shouldn't play with bombs

Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along

What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky

Did I  hear somebody say "Down with the system"?
Shut your mouth

Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along

What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky

Don't try to figure out what this song is about

Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along

What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky

Did I hear somebody say "Sing a song, soul sister"?
