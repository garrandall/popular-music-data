There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere


There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
Someday!


Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living


Oh, we'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere


Somewhere


There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there

Somehow
Someday
Somewhere!
