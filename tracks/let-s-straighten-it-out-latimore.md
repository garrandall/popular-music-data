Sit yourself down, girl
And talk to me
And tell me what's on your mind
Don't you keep on tellin' me everything's okay
Cause if it was
Then you wouldn't be cryin'

You been tossin' and turnin' in yo' sleep lately, baby
Sittin' 'round poutin' all day long
Now, how in the hell you expect me to understand
When I don't even know what's wrong?

Let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straighten it out, honey
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out

For the last five nights, honey, when we went to bed
Oh, I could tell somethin' just wasn't right
When you turned your back to me and you covered your head
Then you didn't even say goodnight

Now, if you tired 'n' you don't wan' be bothered, baby
Just say the word and I'll leave you 'lone
Instead of layin' out cryin' yo' eyes out, baby
You and me oughta be getting' it on

Let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straight it out, honey
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out

Why don't you talk to me, honey?
Now, how in the hell do you expect me to understand
When I don't even know what's wrong?
I believe we gon' straighten it out
