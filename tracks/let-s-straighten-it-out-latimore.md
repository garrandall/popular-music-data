(Hit 'em with the Jabz)
(BUDDAH BLESS this beat)

Psychedelic flow
I'm the dope and the antidote
Played down the street from the package store
What ya know?
Goin' back 'n' forth, in and out
Movin' lateral
Tools like mechanics
Takin women for collateral
Put her on the saddle 
With a paddle and an Adderall 
Just tryna Straighten It Out like Latimore
Old-timer-ass nigga you are unemployed
I'll buy my girl a building with the furniture
You still gettin' that hair done, I'm on the tummy tuck
Yeah, I'm 2 Chainz, I'm known to double-up
In the double-R with with a double-cup
Yeah I double-parked at the W
I'm from the Southside, gonna throw it up
Bein' around lame niggas give me phobia (Damn)
Every verse I do need a coroner
They say I'm heavy-handed when I'm pourin' up
Above sea-level, I'm on G-level
Long as she naked, I will see her now

The money in the way for what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down
It's definitely in the way
I'm on three necklace
Talkin' big flexes
Turned the phone off
And she still textin'

The money in the way for what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down
It's definitely in the way
It's definitely in the way
The bands all get replaced 
Whatever's in the safe
I'll put it in your face

They say life a bitch
We goin' on a date 
I came from canned goods
I came from paper plates
God don't make mistakes
But He'll make a way
I got a pinky ring
It cost 'bout 80K
You was led astray
I'm 'bout to set the pace
I think I'm booked-up
But let me check the date

Watch my footsteps, yeah, anchor weight
Bought a new scale, tryna calibrate
Tryna add it up, I'm tryna allocate
Bought them red tops, talkin' alligat'
You can clap that, talkin' pat-a-cake
School of hard knocks, you ain't graduate
Surround the bedroom with some yellow tape
Add some chalk lines, they gon' investigate
Above sea-level, I'm on G-level
Long as she naked, I will see her now

The money in the way for what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down
It's definitely in the way
I'm on three necklace
Talkin' big flexes
Turned the phone off
And she still textin'

The money in the way for what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down
It's definitely in the way
