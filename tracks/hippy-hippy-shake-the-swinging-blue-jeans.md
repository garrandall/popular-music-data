For goodness sake
I got the hippy hippy shakes
Yeah, I got the shakes
I got the hippy hippy shakes

Oh, I can't sit still
With the hippy hippy shakes
Yeah, I get my fill now
With the hippy hippy shakes
Yeah, it's in the bag
Oh! The hippy hippy shake

Well, now you shake it to the left
You shake it to the right
You do the hippy shake shake
With all your might, oh baby
Yeah, come on and shake
Aw, it's in the bag
Oh! The hippy hippy shake, ow!

Well, now you shake it to the left
You shake it to the right
You do the hippy shake shake
With all your might, oh baby
Yeah, come on and shake
Aw, it's in the bag
Oh! The hippy hippy shake
Oh! The hippy hippy shake
Oh! The hippy hippy shake
