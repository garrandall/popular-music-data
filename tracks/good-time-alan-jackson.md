Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ah, I need a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!


Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Ah, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh


I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time


Ohh, yea, a good time
I need a good time
Yea, a good time
