Beast mode (Yeah), go beast mode
Ballin' so hard, yeah, they think I got the cheat code
Huh, I got the cheat code
Spent two bands on some mothafuckin' jeans, ho
Those is Mike Amiri jeans though
Yeah, bad little bitch, and she came from Puerto Rico
Yeah, she a freak ho (Huh)
Yeah, I don't really wanna fall in love with a freak ho
Yeah, she a freak ho
Huh, ballin' so hard they gon' think I got the cheat code
They gon' think I got the cheat code, yeah


I don't gotta do it
NBA gon' follow up, but, nigga, Rock'll do it
Yeah, but fuck it, I'ma do it
I got a .40 with a drum and I know how to use it
It go, with the beat, I told 'em, "It's the music"
See the pinky ring when I throw up the W
I gotta keep a pistol in my Bentley coupe, yeah
Don't get too comfortable, yeah
My Patek too flooded up, yeah
Got a Rollie but I fucked it up, yeah
We don't know about a one on one
We don't fuck with them if they don't fuck with us, yeah


Beast mode (Yeah), go beast mode
Ballin' so hard, yeah, they think I got the cheat code
Huh, I got the cheat code
Spent two bands on some mothafuckin' jeans, ho
Those is Mike Amiri jeans though
Yeah, bad little bitch, and she came from Puerto Rico
Yeah, she a freak ho (Huh)
Yeah, I don't really wanna fall in love with a freak ho
Yeah, she a freak ho
Huh, ballin' so hard they gon' think I got the cheat code
They gon' think I got the cheat code, yeah


Huh, man, I swear I be so faded
I almost forgot that I was famous
Last night I almost popped a nigga
He got too close, he had a hoodie on, he wanted a picture
He ain't even think that I was about to smoke him like a fucking swisher
I can't afford it, I got a daughter, you won't catch me slippin'
Yeah, shit been gettin' realer, I been gettin' richer
What I just spent up on my neck could pay a bitch tuition
All my diamonds, they be dancin' like they New Edition
I mix the Louis and Supreme, that's limited edition
Fuck your bitch and now your bitch, she missin'
Yeah, mothafucka I'm in...


Beast mode (Yeah), go beast mode
Ballin' so hard, yeah, they think I got the cheat code
Huh, I got the cheat code
Spent two bands on some mothafuckin' jeans, ho
Those is Mike Amiri jeans though
Yeah, bad little bitch, and she came from Puerto Rico
Yeah, she a freak ho (Huh)
Yeah, I don't really wanna fall in love with a freak ho
Yeah, she a freak ho
Huh, ballin' so hard they gon' think I got the cheat code
They gon' think I got the cheat code, yeah


Fuck her with my jeans on, I fuck her with my chains on
She like how I be kicking shit, might think that I'm from Hong Kong
Everybody turn yo power off if yo phone's on
Hoe you gon' get slapped up in yo shit using the wrong tone
PnB got all us Milly Rocking with his song on
A Boogie just walked up in the party with his hoodie on
You know me, rollin' off a pill, strapped up with that chrome
Ho, don't walk up smilin' in my face if I can't take you home
Baby girl, I'm leaning right now on a four
You know I'm going hard when it's time for beast mode
I'm turnt up, I'm out my body, I'm in crunch mode
.40 Glock up in my pocket, you don't wanna know


Beast mode (Yeah), go beast mode
Ballin' so hard, yeah, they think I got the cheat code
Huh, I got the cheat code
Spent two bands on some mothafuckin' jeans, ho
Those is Mike Amiri jeans though
Yeah, bad little bitch, and she came from Puerto Rico
Yeah, she a freak ho (Huh)
Yeah, I don't really wanna fall in love with a freak ho
Yeah, she a freak ho
Huh, ballin' so hard they gon' think I got the cheat code
They gon' think I got the cheat code, yeah
