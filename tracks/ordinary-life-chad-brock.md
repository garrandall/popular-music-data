Shelly's at the kitchen table, cup of coffee, the morning paper
When he walks in she's so surprised to see the tears in his eyes
He says, "I love you, I'm so sorry but bigger dreams
Are waiting for me but I can't do this anymore"

Pay the bills, watch TV, day in day out, the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
We go to church, go to work, so picture perfect that it hurts
I feel like I'm trapped inside this ordinary life

Shelly's at the kitchen table, crayons, construction paper
"Hey mom, look what I drew, it's a picture of me and you"
And later when he says his prayers
She runs her fingers through his hair, so thankful for every day

They pay their bills, watch TV, day in day out, it's all they need
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
They go to church, go to school, everyday it's something new
Precious are the days as they go by in their ordinary life

Phone rings, he's calling from the airport
It's midnight, he's all alone again
He says, "I can't believe how much I've missed
And what I wouldn't give"

To pay the bills, watch TV, day in day out, the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
Go to church, go to work, I can't tell you how this hurts
I miss my son, I miss my wife and my ordinary life
