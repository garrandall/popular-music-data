Color in sky, Prussian blue
Scarlet fleece changes hue
Crimson ball sinks from view
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love)
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Color sky, Havana lake
Color sky, rose Carmarthen
Alizarin crimson
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love)
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Cannot believe what I see
All I have wished for will be
All our race proud and free
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)

Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love)
