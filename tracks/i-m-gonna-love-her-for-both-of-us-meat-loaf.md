I can't stand to see it no more the way you're living with a
Goddess
But you treat her like a slave and you can't hold her back anymore
She's like a dreamer in a dungeon or an Angel in a cave

And I'll be closer to you now than any other boy
And you know what I'm saying is true you're gonna break her up
And tear her down and fade her away
And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do

But if you give me your girl and then you give me your trust
And if you give me till the end of the night-
I'm gonna love her for both of us

I'm gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live

I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done

You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

You can't hide anymore you had a chance and you blew it
And you'll never get it back and your holiness was never so pure
She needs a fire in the heart and not a stabbing in the back

And I've been closer to you now than any other boy
So you know what I'm saying is true you're gonna break her up
And tear her down and fade her away
And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do

But if you give me your girl and then you give me your trust
And if you give me till the end of the night -
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live
I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

When the screws are tightnin' and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved and like a bolt of lightning
I go answer the call but then
She's singing like a siren to me over the waves

I never wanted to take away your lover
Until I heard her cry out to be saved
I always thought of you as one of my brothers
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
Singing like a siren to me over the waves
There ain't no holding me down

I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna love her for both of us
Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
