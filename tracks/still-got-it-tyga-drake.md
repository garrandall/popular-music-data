I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? âcause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know Iâm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?


Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
âCause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment âcause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
Whatâs the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
Iâd rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like âone more chanceâ, more problems no biggie ah
Itâs all good donât take it the wrong way
Ainât nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ainât even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?


I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? âcause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know Iâm blunt, but how real is that,
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I stillâ¦


Uh, ainât no, ainât nobody like you
Heard you gotta ballplayer, but he donât excite you
I ainât the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when Iâm rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, âcause Iâm the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barneyâs, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit


I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? âcause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know Iâm blunt, but how real is that,
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go, itâs better that you know
I still.
