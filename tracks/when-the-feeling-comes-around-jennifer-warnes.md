We were walking in the sand
I could feel your heart pound
A man and a woman
Walking in the sundown

Maybe now I'll understand
How you feel the way you do
We all have the same emotion, baby
I can feel it too

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

I have looked for love before
I was looking all around you
I'm not looking anymore
Now that I've found you
I've found you

When there's something deep inside
That tells me this is real
We're not just going through the motions this time
I know it's love we feel

Just like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
Like the rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

La, la, la, da, la, la, la
La, la, la, da, la

Like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
