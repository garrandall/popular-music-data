They call me the hunter, that's my name
A handsome man like you is my only game
I bought me a love gun just the other day
And I aim to aim it your way
It ain't no use to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I got you in the sight of my love gun

The first time I saw ya standing on the street
I said to myself, oh ain't he sweet
I got my love gun loaded with a hugs and kisses
And when I pull my trigger there won't be no misses
It ain't no need to hide
Ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sight of my love gun

It ain't no used to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I got you in the sight of my love gun

I'm a big game hunter, baby
How can I miss when I got good aim
All I ever hunt is a big handsome man
On my way, hey

They call me the hunter
That's my name
A handsome man like you is my only game
I bought me a love gun just the other day
And I aim to aim it your way
Ain't no use to hide
And it ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sight of my love gun

The first time I saw you standing on the street
I said to myself, ow, ain't he sweet?
I got my love gun loaded with hugs and kisses
And when I pull my trigger there won't be no misses
It ain't no use to hide and it ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sight of my love gun, hey

Oh, it ain't no used to hide ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sight of my love gun
I'm a big game how can I miss when I got good aim
All I ever hunt is a big handsome man
Hey, alright and I'm on my way
