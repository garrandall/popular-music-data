People going, coming
Traffic always humming
A sweet city song
Everyone your neighbor
Living at a flavor
With a sweet city song

There was a certain way
That the city sound
Made you glad you belonged
I remember now
That the rhythm somehow
Made me want to sing along

Do do do do, sweet city song
Do do do do, sweet city song
Oh, come on along

Boxes on a brick wall
Boys are playing stickball
The chicks are walking by
Something bout their sweaters
Made you play a little better
Or at least you'd try

Meanwhile on the corner
A group is singing
In three-part harmony
There was a time
When you couldn't find
A better place to be

Do do do do, sweet city song
Do do do do, sweet city song
Do do do do, sweet city song
Come on

Johnny, ride the pony
The Dodger's own sym-phoney
An egg cream at the
Corner candy store
Radio and dancing slow
Who could ask for more

Do do do do, sweet city song
Do do do do, sweet city song
Do do do do, sweet city song
Come on along

Hello, Jack, it's good to be back
I been away at school
Yeah, Ed, I heard what you said
You know that I'm no fool

I know that it's changing
I see that it's changed
I know that it's changing
I see that it's changed

But goodbye is too hard
For me to say
When I still believe
The good things
Outweigh the bad

I think of all the
Good times we had
Think of all the
Good times we had

A junkie steals, a mayor deals
Who knows what's coming next
Traffic jams and greedy hands
Did you read it in the text

Of the daily news
The subway blues
How does your garden grow
And the strikes and the likes
All lined up in a row

Something is wrong here
It doesn't belong here
People are locking themselves
Behind their own four walls

It falls from the skies here
But no one's surprised here
And maybe that's the
Saddest part of all

Jesus freaks
Mohammed speaks
The Lord is on their team
Tenements and midtown rents
Rich and poor live in between

Say a prayer and breathe the air
In the cold or heat
When evening falls, the city calls
But the lights only shine
On empty streets

Something is wrong here
Doesn't belong here
People are locking themselves
Behind their own four walls

Falls from the skies here
No one's surprised here
Maybe that's the
Saddest part of all

Something is wrong here
Doesn't belong here
People are locking themselves
Behind their own four walls

Falls from the skies here
No one's surprised here
Maybe that's the
Saddest part of all

I think of her
I think of life's own music
At least that's the way
It used to be

I think of her and I
See the children laughing
But it's only on the streets
Of my memory

And I never felt so lonely
And so helpless
Wishing that I didn't
Know the truth

But they tell me
That a friend is dying
And there's nothing
In this world I can do

When she was good
It was, oh, so good
You were blessed
If she smiled on you

You could be king
If she believed your story
When it was over
If she laughed at you

Now I've never felt so lonely
And so helpless
I'm wishing that I
Didn't know the truth

They tell me
That a friend is dying
And there is nothing
In this world that I can do

The hands that used to
Reach out to everybody
Now they're lying by her side

And her eyes are closed
No one really knows
If she can make it through
Another night

Still most of what I love
Is locked inside her
Everything I thought
I'd ever need

My heart keeps crying
You've got to hold on
A little bit longer
But my head is sure
That it's time to leave

And I've never felt so lonely
And so helpless
I'm wishing that I
Didn't know the truth

And they tell me that
My friend is dying
And there's nothing
In this world that I can do

I've never felt so lonely
And so helpless
I'm wishing that I
Didn't know the truth

They tell me that
A friend, a friend is dying

Oh, New York City
Can you say it ain't true
Can you tell me now
Before I'm leaving you

I'd give anything I own
Just to believe in you again
