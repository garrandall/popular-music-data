I look at you and it's like being in a safe place, ya know?
I look into your eyes and I see a part of me that's gone on now.
And I wonder how long I can keep it inside your eyes, ya know?

I look at you and see more possibilities.
Little mes with more opportunities.
BooBoo I see ya 20 years down the road, when you wont listen to dad, because he old.
Ive lived my life, now you gotta live your own.
Tell ya bout my experience and just go on, got it?
You're the one that kept me alive boo.
Kiki, that's who kept me alive for you.
Grandma kept me alive for all ya'll.
My only regret is ya never got to see pa-pa.
I'm sumthin like him though.
Rain, sleet, or snow, no matter what I gotta do or where i gotta go.
I never say no, how could I?
When those girls is how I block out the rest of the whole world.
Tic-tak-toe to designer bags, sweet 16, daddy tryin to buy ya'll Jags.

I look at you and see somebody that used to reside inside me.
All of daddy's better qualities.
I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance,
We should try to be more like our children....oh. 

I see in you what I used to see in me.
Before they let me see what I never should've seen.
Gotti came up, G'd up, straps around her.
Bunch of G's given one another daps around her.
Hearin me tell killers watch their mouths around her.
Mossbergs laid out in the house around her.
And shell remember me. Kennedy will never see.
People might sell em' out, but never me.
I got your back baby, even when you're wrong.
You got lost in the world, mommy just come on home.
You don't gotta go through anything alone.
Regardless of what coast you end up on.
I jump on a plane, daddys in route.
I may not say baby come back to the house.
Stay and fight it out, cause I'm thinkin you could win.
Like I came this time, daddy will come right back again.

I look at you and see somebody that used to reside inside me.
All of daddys better qualities. I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance.
We should try to be more like our children...oh. 

I see honesty that you don't see in adults.
Love in these hugs, more addictive than drugs.
I wish I could see the world so innocently, I ain't gon' do to them like you did it to me.
I'm the bodyguard, Kevin Costner.
I'm whatever falls under bein a father.
A protector, provider, companion, padre, listen to you talk and wont say a word all day.
I feel your pain like it happened to me, got it?
You're the reason i quit rappin for free.
Its like a whole nother level that these babies be on, you should see the grades that these babies bring home.
Wow! That's my child, so proud!
And you can see it in her smile and her frown, you don't wanna let em' down.
The only ones that make you look at things the other way around.

I look at you and see somebody that used to reside inside me.
All of daddys better qualities. I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance.
We should try to be more like our children...oh.
