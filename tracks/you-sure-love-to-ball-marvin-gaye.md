OhBaby please turn yourself around
Ah baby so I can love you
Ohh baby baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh baby just like you want me to
Ohhh
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby I hope you never freeze
I love you I love you so much
Ohh baby baby don't ever go no where
Ohh baby I'll love you night and day
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
Since you're my foxy lady, foxy lady
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(on my mind there's...)
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got ot get ready
(oh)
Ohh baby You sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
