Where have you gone, my Rosealia?
Into the crowd, he'll never find you.
If you walk real fast, and you stay down low.
So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last.


You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.
You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.

What has he done, my senorita?
His kind of love is going to kill you.
Do you fake a smile when you dodge the blows?
So many times, so many chances.
This one could be your last.


You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.
You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.


Jealousy can rip your heart out.
And jealousy can turn a hand into a fist.


You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.
You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.
Put on your mask, wearing your cape.
Put on your mask, my Rosealia.

Rosealia
