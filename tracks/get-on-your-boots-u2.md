Future needs a big kiss 
Winds blow with a twist 
Never seen a move like this 
Can you see it too 
Night is falling everywhere 
Rockets hit the funfair 
Satan loves a bomb scare 
But it won't scare you 

Hey...Sexy Boots 
Get on your Boots 
Yeah... 

Free me from the dark dream 
Candy bars, ice cream 
All the kids are screaming but the ghosts arent real 
Here's what you gotta be 
Love & community 
Laughter is eternity if the joy is real 

You don't know how beautiful 
You don't know how beautiful 
You are... 
You don't know 
You get it do you 
You don't know 
How beautiful you are... 

If someones into blowing up 
Were into growing up 
Women are the future 
All the big revelations 
I've gotta submarine 
You've got gasoline 
I don't wanna talk about wars between nations 
Not right now 

Sexy Boots 
Get on your Boots 
Yeah... 
Foxy boots 

You don't know how beautiful 
You don't know how beautiful 
You are... 

Sexy Boots 
I don't wanna talk about wars 

Let me in the sound 
Let me in the sound 
Let me in the sound 
My God I'm going down 
I don't wanna drown now 
Let me in the sound 

Let me in the sound 
Let me in the sound 
Let me in the sound 

Get on your Boots 
Get on your Boots 
Yeah...
