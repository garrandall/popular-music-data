It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache
Hit you when its too late
Hit you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin' but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feelin' like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Lovin till your arms break
Then he let you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care
For you...

It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on
You

Whoa, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache
Hit you when its too late
Hit you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin' but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feelin' like a clown
