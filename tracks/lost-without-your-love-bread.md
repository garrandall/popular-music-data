Lost and all alone
I always thought
That I could make it on my own

Since you left
I hardly make it through the day
My tears get in the way
And I need you back to stay

I wander through the night
And search the world to find
The words to make it right

All I want is just
The way it used to be
With you here close to me
I've got to make you see

That I'm lost without your love
Life without you
Isn't worth the trouble of

I'm as helpless
As a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel
I can't believe it's real

And someday soon
I'll wake
And find my heart
Won't have to break

Yes, I'm lost without your love
Life without you isn't
Worth the trouble of

All I want is just
The way it used to be
I need you here with me

Oh, darling
Can't you see?
If we had love before
We can have it back once more
