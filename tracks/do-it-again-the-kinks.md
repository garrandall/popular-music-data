Standing in the middle of nowhere
Wondering how to begin
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday
Between now and then

And now we're back where we started
Here we go round again
Day after day I get up and I say
I better do it again

Where are all the people going?
Round and round till we reach the end
One day leading to another
Get up, go out, do it again

Then it's back where you started
Here we go round again
Back where you started
Come on do it again

And you think today is going to be better
Change the world and do it again
Give it all up and start all over
You say you will but you don't know when

Then it's back where you started
Here we go round again
Day after day I get up and I say
Come on do it again

The days go by and you wish you were a different guy
Different friends and a new set of clothes
You make alterations and affect a new pose
A new house, a new car, a new job, a new nose
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep
Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep
Get back, get back

Back where you started, here we go round again
Back where you started, come on do it again

Back where you started, here we go round again
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again
Do it again
Day after day I get up and I say, come on do it again
