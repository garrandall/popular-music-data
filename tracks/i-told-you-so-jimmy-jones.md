Here I am with a broken heart,
My whole world is falling apart.
Here I am feeling low,
All you ever say is 'I told you so.'

You say, "I told you so,
I try to let you talk to me
'I told you so, '
That's all you ever say to me."
Well here I am, I guess you win
"I told you so;" quit rubbin' it in.

Here I sit in misery,
You ain't got no sense of me
Here I am feeling low,
All you ever say is 'I told you so.'

You say, 'I told you so,
I try to let you talk to me
'I told you so, '
That's all you ever say to me."
Well, here I am, I guess you win
"I told you so;" quit rubbin' it in.

(Instrumental break)

You think you show some pity for my broken heart,
All you do is stand around looking smart.
You say, "I told you so,
I try to let you talk to me.
'I told you so, '
That's all you ever say to me."
Well, here I am, I guess you win.
"I told you so;" quit rubbin' it in.
