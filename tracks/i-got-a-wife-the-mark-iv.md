Hey, I got a wife at home
I got a wife at home
I got a wife she's the apple of my life
But I wish she would leave me alone

When I hear
Hang your clothes up
Wipe your feet off
Goodness sake don't slam the door
Fix the socket, dry the dishes
Can't you do a single chore?
Hang the picture
Set the table
Don't drop ashes on the floor
Heat the bottle
Change the baby
You don't love me anymore

He don't love her anymore
There he goes right out the door
He'll be back 'bout half past ten
And then she'll start right in again

Tack the shade up
Wash the windows
Wipe the handprints off the door
Change the light bulbs
Scrub the bathtub
Pick the toys up from the floor
Tape the lamp cord
Make some coffee
Burn the garbage
Oil the door
Get the kids
And call my mother
You don't love me anymore

I got a wife at home
I got a wife at home
I got a wife she's the apple of my life
But I wish she would leave me alone

When I hear

(Hang your clothes up
Wipe your feet off
Goodness sake don't slam the door)

OK OK I'll do it

(Can't you do a single chore?
Hang the picture
Set the table
Don't drop ashes on the floor)

Yeah OK

(Heat the bottle
Change the baby
You don't love me anymore
Tack the shade up
Wash the windows)

Honey, honey

(Wipe the handprints off the door
Change the light bulbs
Scrub the bathtub
Pick the toys up from the floor)

Please, honey

(Tape the lamp cord
Make some coffee)

Yeah I'll do it

(Oil the door)

QUIET!

He don't love her anymore
There he goes right out the door
He'll be back 'bout half past ten
And then she'll start right in again

SHEE!
