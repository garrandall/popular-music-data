Wanted man

Well, low dealer, with snake eyes
You cross me, you realize you're-
You're hot leather, you're cold steel
You make a move, I'll make you feel like a
Human target, in my eyes
I've got you, well, in my sights
And by the rope, you will hang
It's your neck, from this Ratt gang

'Cause I'm a wanted man
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man

Well, gun fighter, you think twice
Are you fast, you heed my advice
I drink whiskey, you say goodnight
I'll put an end, to this here fight you're a
Human target, In my eyes
I've got you, well in my sights
And by the rope, you will hang
It's your neck, from this Ratt gang

It's really what you wanna be
A wanted man (a wanted man) 

'Cause I'm a, a wanted man
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man, yes I am
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man
