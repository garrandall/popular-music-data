Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight

Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight


I look at you
You look at me
And then we smile
Knowing what we`re in for

The kiss that you give
Makes me want you more and more
We`re having the time of our lives

And then you say that
I will always be the one
Someone right for your dreams at night

I wish we could be
Right here
Right now, always
Touching and loving you so right


Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight

Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight


Seeing you here by my side
Words come out that I can`t hide
You`re an image of my dreams

I need you
And you need me too
As long as we keep holding on
I`ll be there for you


Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight

Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight
Love
Your body
Your beauty
I want more


I want you to
Hold me, love me, squeeze me
I need you to
Touch me, please me, tease me

I want you to
Hold me, love me, squeeze me
I need you to
Touch me, please me, tease me


Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight

Just want to hold you tight
All day
All night
Just want to hold you tight
