Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where
I've really always been

I got over you just long enough
To let my heartache mend
Then today I started
Loving you again

What a fool I was
To think I could get by
With only these few million
Tears I've cried

I should have known
The worse was yet to come
And the crying time for me
Had just begun

Cause today
I started loving you again
I'm right back where
I've really always been

I got over you just long enough
To let my heartache mend
Then today I started
Loving you again

Yes, today
I started loving you again
