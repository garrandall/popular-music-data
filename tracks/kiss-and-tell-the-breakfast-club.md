If I got before I wake, they can say I never did it
A lot of these niggers ainât gonâ never say they did it
Like abbreviated words it just feel like something's missing
I can dig it I concur you might get me if you listen
Prefer to be different so gifted, I'm cursed
No mystery, I'm first
Fuck what he said, image rather exquisite
Nigger never seen that before John Cooper
The glass roof in that look like can spin that
Itâs publicity, statue wish you rather rapping
Window tints there, he must be an athlete
No nigger it's just lil' ol' me
Ah you and me old beef is gonâ be
My life is Kobain, meaning I OD
And speak my mind like fuck the police
Cause they should scream
Wait, let Rule be, let's start shooting straight to the tope
Heading to the top

Keep them rocking till the sun gonâ drop
Keep spending money cause I got it so much
Club banger make them all show up
It ain't a sign of slowing down cause we're going straight to the top
Chain swinging, hanging low to the top
Keep sipping if you going to the top
Can't stop going straight to the top
Meet me at the teepee weâre going to the top

If I never catch a breakfast because I canât broken
Never give a hope, if I did that would be hopeless
Never wanna loose focus, I'm a visionary
I see far, I can see if the savants can expose it
Why go Brooklyn naming that position on me
Save a secondary, commentary witness, gossip, you overhear it
Damn canaries, you can hear them singing
Rock tombs like the stones that makes your spirits
This ainât just Sundance, this is real shit
In my presence to walk you should feel privileged
So arrogant yea so confident
I send books to them, I can't tell the difference
Muah, kiss myself, Gene Simons
Sometimes I get high, my sky has no limits
And why should it, one minute walk on the moon
Itâs the beautiful stars
Baby meet me at the top

Keep them rocking till the sun gonâ drop
Keep spending money cause I got it so much
Club banger make them all show up
It ain't a sign of slowing down cause we're going straight to the top
Chain swinging, hanging low to the top
Keep sipping if you going to the top
Can't stop going straight to the top
Meet me at the teepee weâre going to the top

Today Iâm driving cruising down town
And itâs eight till night the Eiffel Tower we ainât drunk yet
Shout it to my niggers from F to E
Bring it back to the east coast and party like we been here
We throwing hundreds we throwing twentyâs
We got the whole motherfucking club jumping
We ain't running, we see âem coming
We at the top so we don't give a fuck

Keep them rocking till the sun gonna drop
Keep spending money cause I got it so much
Club banger make them all show up
Ain't a sign it's going down cause we're going straight to the top
Chain swinging, hanging low to the top
Keep sipping if you going to the top
Can't stop going straight to the top
Meet me at the teepee weâre going to the top
