Every time somebody says to me
It's a secret
Well I have to laugh
'Cause that is something I just can't keep
It's a secret
Oh I tried it once or twice
But it didn't work too well
So you'd better think it over
'Cause I'm gonna tell

I kiss and tell
And everybody's gonna know
I kiss and tell
I've gotta let my feelings show

Don't you tell me it's gotta be a secret thing
It's no secret
Well I've heard that before
And there's always someone waiting in the wings
It's no secret

If there's somebody else on your mind
Then it's not gonna work too well
You would only be wasting your time
'Cause I'm gonna tell

I kiss and tell
And everybody's gonna know
I kiss and tell
I've gotta let my feelings show

Well I'm not gonna get down to it
Until you make your mind up, you make your mind up, mind up
Mind up
Hurry up, 'cause I want to kiss and tell

If there's somebody else on your mind
Then it's not gonna work too well
You would only be wasting your time
'Cause I'm gonna tell

I kiss and tell
And everybody's gonna know
I kiss and tell
I've gotta let my feelings show

Well I'm not gonna get down to it
Until you make your mind up, you make your mind up, mind up
Mind up
Hurry up, 'cause I want to kiss and tell

I kiss and tell
And everybody's gonna know
I kiss and tell
I've gotta let my feelings show

Well I'm not gonna get down to it
Until you make your mind up
