You can breathe in the music the city makes
Move by the rhythm the Gypsies play
Deep inside it comes alive

There is a whisper that feeds your soul
Word's so beautiful like a Spanish rose
Till you're hypnotized that's when you've arrived


You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on
Get up when you feel it
It's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on, yeah

Ooohh, whoa, yeah!

Pounding the pavement kicking through the streets
To wander like Picasso in the Barcelona heat
Passion is the fashion and life is poetry
We welcome to another world where every heart can beat (ow, ow)

In a different tempo there's never a wrong one (never a wrong one (never a wrong one))
Building to a crescendo
You know the journey is just begun (ah, ah, ah)


You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on
Get up when you feel it
It's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Ooohh!

Hey feel the flow when you just can't move no more (no more)
The city wants to show (aha) you something (something), something (something)
A heart unfolds (unfolds ) that you would never know (never know)
Barcelona's soul (ooh) - so something (something), something good is coming, is coming, yeah
Everybody knows that something good is coming on!


You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on
Get up when you feel it
It's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on

You got to strut..

Bienvenidas, esto es mi sueÃ±o
Come on, come on, get up!
SÃ­ganme y descubran mi Barcelona
Stand! Come on, come on!
Bienvenidas esto es mi sueÃ±o
Come on, come on...
