I know I got all dressed up for the club
Waiting on you come pick me up
Baby, ooh, when I saw ya walking out the door
Ooh, yeah I just knew ya needed something more
Now whip it straight back to the crib, ay
Finna give you something that you won't forget, no
Baby, ooh, I just wanna get you out them clothes
Don't you wanna see me dance in

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
In slow motion

So I'ma let my hair down and take a sip
Gon' put this joint between your lips
So, baby, ooh, why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Ooh, while I go and put this tongue on you
I tell you I'm ready, can you speed it up for me just for a second
Just for a second, then can you slow it back down and keep it steady
Ooh baby, now that you are out them clothes
Ooh, you just wanna see me dance in

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
In slow motion

Oh darling, I just wanna get you out them clothes
Watch me dance in

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
