Yo doc thank for sending me the instrumental, I owe you lunch

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Yeah, I know at moments life get overwhelming, no one helping
But I'll be there to be the air
You need when you breathe, I get scared too
But its my job as big sister
To never let the world creep up to get you
And never let no boy ever think to hit you
Forever smile when you pose for pictures
And everyday, look at your reflection
You're so beautiful life's a blessing
And I know that I'm gone a lot
But I'm working till I'm on the top
And I'm gonna take you right there
I know sometimes, I don't fight fair
Don't you ever give into the hatred
Cause you and I too strong to break it
And I love how you wear my old shoes
And when you cry, then I'm there to hold you
And remember every line that I told you
Never let nobody think they own you
And one day you could run the world
Put a cape on, you're my wonder girl
And you always know what's up
Know that I'm gonna lift both us up

Ah, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Ah, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

(I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us)
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

I wish (I wish) I was strong (one day) enough to lift not one (not one) but both of us (the both of us)

I know those bullies think they tough as ever no one better
Oh so clever, they won't get you
Cause I look at them like, so whatever
You the young man in this family
And I love it ever time that daddy
Looking at you like you're the truth
And we call you that cause you speak the truth
And you always keep us laughing
Wanna know it all, and you keep on asking
And I call you Chunky Monkey
I never let you fall Humpty Dumpty
No one look at the world like you do
Artistic I'm like, who knew?
I wish I was as smart as you is
Got the heart as the size of two kids
Alejandro, hope you knew this
Just be you, if the shoe fits
And you taught me to have some patience
Little brother you are the greatest
Don't you ever be afraid to fail
Just walk that road, I'll pay the will
And you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

(I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us)
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

Someday (yes), I will (I will) be strong enough (one day I'll be so strong, I'll lift the whole world up, say it with me) to lift not one but both of us
And Frankie, you're the big brother of the family I want you to wear that Gomez name proud on the back of that jersey
One day, when the world starts caving in
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both of us up
