Oh, I'm so excited, think about you all the time 
Yes I can't wait to see you baby 
You really best of my mind 
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time 

Oh, when you touch me baby, tears of joy I'm crying 
Oh, when you hold me, chills run up and down my spine 
You're so fine, think about you all the time 

Yes, I'm so excited, I met peace with the world 
Oh, can this love be real? I'm talking about my new, new love 
You're so fine baby, wanna love you all the time 

Hey, I'm so excited, don't know what you're doing myself 
Oh, I'm so happy baby, don't need nobody else 
You're so fine baby, think about you all the time 

Yes, when I look in your eyes, you put me in a trance 
Oh, I just shake all over baby, I feel like I wanna dance 
You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time 

How can this be a dream, can this really happen to me? 
Oh, I surely loved at last, seems like a fantasy 
You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time 

I thought I've been in love, so many many times 
Oh, but this new love, has really messed up my mind 
You're so fine, think about you all the time 

You're so nice and lovin', everything you do is right 
I just can't wait, I can't wait baby 
Can't wait for you hold me tight 
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time
