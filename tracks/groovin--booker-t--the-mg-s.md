Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

Groovin', down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do

There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just

Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
