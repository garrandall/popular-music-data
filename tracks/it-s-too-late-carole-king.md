Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying


And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh no no no no (no no, no no)


It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool


And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Ohhhh, nooo no

{Instrumental}
(Do do do do do do do do doo do doo dahhhhh)


There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you


But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Ohhhh, nooo no no no no


It's too late, baby
It's too late, now darlin'
It's too late
