I stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time 
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin' 
One of us is changin', or maybe we just stopped tryin'. 

And it's too late baby, now it's too late 
Though we really did try to make it 
Something inside has died and I can't hide 
And I just can't fake it, oh no no no no. 

It used to be so easy livin' here with you 
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do 
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool. 
And it's too late baby, now it's too late 
Though we really did try to make it 
Something inside has died and I can't hide 
And I just can't fake it, oh no no. 

Do do do do do do do do do do. 

There'll be good times again for me and you 
But we just can't stay together, don't'cha feel it too? 
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you. 

But it's too late baby, now it's too late 
Though we really did try to make it 
Something inside has died and I can't hide 
And I just can't fake it 
Oh, no no no no no. 

It's too late, baby 
It's too late, now darlin' 
It's too late
