You don't have to cry-cry-cry-cry...alone
‘Cause I'll be right by your side to help you be strong
Baby, dry your eyes
Please be strong
I can pull you through these times and help you hold on


I've been on standby
Waiting for your call
I'll catch any teardrop
Before one can fall
I'll never deceive you
The way others did
I've got what you need, girl
And so much to give


You don't have to cry-cry-cry-cry (Don't cry, lady) alone
I'll be right by your side, you've found a new home
Baby, dry your eyes
Please, you've got to be strong
Just hold, hold on


There's someone here now
Who cares about your needs
We'll make it somehow
‘Cause I'll share your grief
I'm just here to fill you
With some good love and bad times
I'm yours when you need me
Keep me close, I'll keep you warm all the time


You don't have to cry
Oh...I'll be right by your side to help you be strong
Baby, dry your eyes
Hold on
‘Cause I can pull you through these times and help you be strong, yeah
You don't have to cry


Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry...


You don't have to cry...alone
I'll pull you through these times and help you hold on
Baby, dry your eyes
Be strong
‘I can pull you through these times and help you hold on


Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(And you don't have to cry, girl)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(You can dry your eyes)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(Never alone)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(You don't have to cry)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(Baby, dry your eyes)
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(Never alone)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(You don't have to be alone)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(And you don't have to cry, girl)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(You can dry your eyes)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(And you don't have to cry, girl)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(Hold on)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(Never alone)(You don't have to cry, boy)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(Baby, dry your eyes)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(Oh, you don't have to cry, boy)
You can be strong if you just hold on
You don't have to cry
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(And you don't have to cry, girl)
You can be strong if you just hold on
(You can dry your eyes)
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
(And you don't have to cry, girl, no)
You can be strong if you just hold on
Baby, dry your eyes
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
You don't have to cry...
