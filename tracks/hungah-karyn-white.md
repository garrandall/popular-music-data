Oh
Oh, baby

An appetizin' love recipe
Just like honey to honey bees, oh
I just can't get enough
So fill me up, quench my appetite
I think you know what I have in mind (And you got it)
I'm not gonna let go

I'm burnin' with desire
I'm starvin' for your love
Put out my fire
Oh, don't ask what you should do
Be the doctor, baby, I'm in need of a cure
I hunger for your love

I hunger for your love (Just a little bit)
I hunger for your love (Ooh, baby, I hunger)
I hunger for your love (Hunger for your love)
I hunger for your love

Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger
Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger

Ooh

A tantalizin' love fantasy
And when your body is close to me, oh
I end up in a fuss
The heat is on and I start to sweat
I wanna take a bite
But I know you're not mine yet, but, baby, oh, baby, I want you

I crave the way you move (Oh, do it, baby)
If I act too polite I just might lose
My chance at lovin' you
If what I'm thinkin' feels this pleasin'
Then the real thing will keep me screamin' for you

I hunger for your love (Baby, I hunger for love)
I hunger for your love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hunger)
I hunger for your love (I hunger for your love)
I hunger for your love

I'm burnin' with desire, baby
Your body heat just drives me crazy, yeah, yeah
{I hunger for your love}
I need your lovin' here tonight
To fill my lovin' appetite, I hunger
{I hunger for your love}

Hunger for your love
I hunger for your love
Hunger for your love

I'm starvin' and I need what's makin' me weak
Like a bee needs honey, baby, I need lovin'
Can I get it, come on
Can I get it, come on
Can I get it from you, baby, come on
Ooh, I want ya, hoo
Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh...

So tell me what you wanna do (Yeah)
Delight me with the pleasures of you
Baby, I want ya
So fill me up with your love real severe

I hunger for your love (Oh, I hunger for you baby, how I want ya)
I hunger for your love (It's so good, I need your love)
I hunger for your love (Oh, baby, I hunger)
I hunger for your love (For your love)

I hunger for your love
I hunger for your love

Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger
Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger
