She said, "I'm going out with my girlfriends
For margaritas at the Holiday Inn"
Oh have mercy my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off

I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patron
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

Them panty hose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a table cloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

She don't mean nothing, she's just havin' fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh tequila makes her clothes fall off
