Make someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
Make just one heart the heart to sing to

One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One li'l girl you're everything to

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?

Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her
Build your world around her

Make someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
And you will be happy, too

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?

Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her
Build a world around her

Make someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
And you will be happy, too
