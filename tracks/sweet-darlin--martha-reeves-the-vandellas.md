Hm hm-mm-mmm (sweet darlin')
Hm hm-mm-mmm
Hm hm-mm-mmm
Hm hm-mm-mmm (sweet darlin')


You're the brightest, warm sunshine that fills my every day
You're the sweet soul music that sets my heart at play
You're the string around my mind that spins it like a top
And such a good bad habit, I just don't want to stop

You got my mind in a ball and chains
Your good love is driving me insane
Like a moth I can't avoid the flames, sweet darlin'
I'd walk a mile just to see your face
And you can in your embrace
'Cause when you smile I'm a hopeless case, sweet darlin'

Hm hm-mm-mmm, hm hm (sweet darlin')
Hm hm-mm-mmm (sweet darlin')
Oh yes you are


All my friend and neighbors just can't believe it's true
They say you're no good for me, honey, and I'm too good for you
But if I 'stand this understandin', always will be thin
'Cause they can't see what you mean to me from the outside lookin' in

I'm gonna love you 'til the end of time
With a love as strong as Georgia pine
And ain't no bad talk is gonna change my mind, sweet darlin'
I'm like a needle in a stack of hay
Here I am and here I stay
'Til milk runs out of the Milky Way, sweet darlin'

Hm hm-mm-mmm, oh yes you are
Hm hm-mm-mmm, (sweet darlin') oh yes you are


You've got my mind in a ball and chains
Your good love is driving me insane
Like a moth I can't avoid the flames, sweet darlin'
I'd walk a mile just to see your face
And you can in your embrace
'Cause when you smile I'm a hopeless case, sweet darlin'

Hm hm-mm-mmm, (sweet darlin')
Oh yes you are!
Hm hm-mm-mmm, (sweet darlin') oh yes you are
Hm hm-mm-mmm
