Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor


Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up


If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more


Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that


Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up


If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more


Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more
Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more


If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more


Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more
