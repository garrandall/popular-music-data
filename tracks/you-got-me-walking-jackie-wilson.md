Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
My heart's been broken so many times
That's where I begun to draw the line
But your cookin' is good, your kissin' is fine
And your lovin', baby, is right on time
Ain't no man so bad
That he cannot be bad
You got me walking, yeah (You got me walking)
Facing the floor
You got me knocking (Knock-knock-knock-knock)
On the wrong door
You got me talking, yeah (You got me talking)
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
Oh, breakfast in the morning, right on time (Feels so good)
While you teach the little baby (La-la-la-la-la-la-la) a nursery rhyme
I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lucky, lucky, lucky man, you better believe
'Cause ain't no man so bad
That he cannot be bad
You got me walking, yeah (You got me walking)
Facing the floor
You got me knocking (Knock-knock-knock-knock)
On the wrong door, yeah
You got me talking, yeah (You got me talking)
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me walking (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Feels so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me talking (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Feels so good
You got me walking, yeah (You got me walking)
Facing the floor (Feels so good)
You got me knocking (Knock-knock-knock-knock)
On the wrong door (Feels so good)
You got me talking, yeah (You got me talking)
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
