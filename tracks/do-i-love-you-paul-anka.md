Beyond the shadow of a doubt
As the mighty river flows
As the meadow gaily plays
With the wind on summer days
Bout as deep as deep can go
From the canyons to the sky
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bears

Do I love you? Don't you know by now?
Do I love you? Must I show you how?
Do I love you? Must I always say?
Do I love you? Yes in every way!

About a s sacred as a hymn
And a Bible full of prayers
From a whisper, to a roar
Very much and even more
And I shall show it with my eyes
And share it with the night
If in death the good Lord is kind
You'll be the last thing on my mind

Do I love you? Don't you know by now?
Do I love you? Must I show you how?
Do I love you? Must do I have to say?
Do I love you? Yes in every way!

Do I love you? You should know by now
Do I love you? Must I show you how?
Do I love you? Do I have to say?
Do I love you? Yes in every way!

Do I love you?
You should know by now
Do I love you?
