We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her
Look out, babe


She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew


How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day
Split, man


She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew


La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
