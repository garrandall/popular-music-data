Tellin' you darlin' we can do it in style
My imagination is drivin' me wild
'Cause the things that you're sayin'
Cuttin' right through me
Way that you're swayin'
Is gonna undo me and I'm

So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away

Baby you know you're lookin' good tonight
I don't know what's wrong or what's right
'Cause you're shaking me up
I'm lost in the feeling
Taking me up
Up to the ceiling, it's

So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away

Somewhere deep inside my mind
Emotions feeling right
Lay me down and hold me close
Take me through the night
Rock me baby

If you're looking for an ornate man
Baby, I'm doing the best I can
'Cause I'm takin' my time
Finding ways
Out of my mind
All I can say is that I'm

So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away

Keep on rocking me baby
Keep on rocking me baby
Roll me away

So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high (you got me movin')
Rock me baby
Roll me away
