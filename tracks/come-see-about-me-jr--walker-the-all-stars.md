I've been crying for you
'Cause I'm lonely, so blue
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away my fears
That you're never ever gonna return (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
To ease the fire that within me burns (Hey, hey, hey, hey)


Keeps me crying baby for you (Crying, crying, crying)
Keeps me sighin' baby for you (Sighing, sighing, sighing)
So why don't you hurry?
Come on girl, see about me (Come see, see about you, yeah)
See about you yeah, that's me (Come see, see about you now)


(Come see, see about you yeah)
(Come see, see about you yeah)


I've given up my friends just for you
My friends have gone and you too
No more peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm gonna love you anyway (Hey, hey, hey, hey)


Keep on crying baby for you (Crying, crying, crying)
I'm gonna keep on sighin' baby for you (Sighing, sighing, sighing)
So come on, hurry
Hey girl, and see about me (Come see, see about you, yeah)
See about you girl, that's me


(Just cryin' for you)
(Just sighin' for you)
(Just cryin' for you)
(Just sighin' for you)
