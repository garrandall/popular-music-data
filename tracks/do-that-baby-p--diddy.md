C'mon now, c'mon now
Cash Money, Bad Boy baby
Let's go


Pretty lady go on do dat dance
Pretty lady go on do dat dance (c'mon now, let's go)
Sexy momma go on do dat dance
Sexy momma go on do dat dance (c'mon now)
Make it move for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Make it jingle for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Touch it down to the floo' (do you like dat daddy?)
Pick it up and let's go (put it right there daddy?)


See I walk through the club wit my Prada on
Vallet to da keys cuz tha cars so strong
Twenty four whoooo, mami know too
Ballas come through tha side doo' wit they crew
I went left and Puff went right
Plus we had on all that ice
I had a bald chick he had one too
I had a mink on she had one too


Hey Birdman hold up a second
You see them ladies over there?
Them ladies singing that thing, ladies sing
Yeah, I like that there
Finish what you were saying


I bought tha bar out so he bought tha bar too
It ain't nothin to a balla mami do what we do
Pimp game wear big rings
Birdman drive a red Range


Pretty lady go on do dat dance
Pretty lady go on do dat dance (c'mon now, let's go)
Sexy momma go on do dat dance
Sexy momma go on do dat dance (c'mon now, let's go)
Pretty lady go on do dat dance
Pretty lady go on do dat dance (c'mon now, let's go)
Sexy momma go on do dat dance
Sexy momma go on do that dance (c'mon now)
Make it move for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Make it jingle for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Touch it down to the floo' (do you like dat daddy?)
Pick it up and let's go (put it right there daddy?)
Make it move for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Make it jingle for me baby (do you like dat daddy?)
Touch it down to the floo' (do you like dat daddy?)
Pick it up and let's go (put it right there daddy?)


Now shake it fast, watch yo'self
Ma show me what you workin wit twerk dat thang
Bounce like dat girl work that thang
Make a pimp wanna hurt that thang
Stop frontin ma and do dat dance
Make yo knees touch ya elbows and do dat dere
What you got dere? Bend ova show that tattoo right there
Jus shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Now look at you momma, oh, high cut
I see from behind ya, oh, she's all that
Baby you a designa wit a, coach bag
Wit a scarf around it wit a, coach hat
Smack it up, slap it up, let me turn it up
Til you steam and you scream, I'm burnin up
On tha scene I seen her doin the butt
Keep doin what your doin to her, let's go

I see you lookin at me momma like you could, drop somethin
Keep lookin at me momma cause you a, hot somethin
Girl shake it around, like you got somethin
No playin around momma, stop frontin


I see what you doin mami, um hum
I like the way you move mami
Me and Diddy could buy you a car, ma
Me and Diddy could make you a star, ma
See those? Let's go
Tell hot get them broads I'll bring 'em to the car show
Wipe a pimp down, touch the floo'
Bend ova pop it love, show me what'cha know
