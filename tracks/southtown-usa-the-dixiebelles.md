Well, I'm gonna pack my
Clothes and leave tonight
I got a big sugar daddy
That's waiting to hold me tight

His kisses knock me off my feet
I wanna go where loving is sweet
In Southtown, USA

Southtown, Southtown
I'm coming home
My heart is aching for a lovely time
And a honeysuckle vine

So I'm going back to my honey shack
In Southtown, Southtown, USA

There's a little old house
Where you can eat by candlelight
And all the hip cats
Meet there every night

They got a red hot band
That you can't beat
And all the cornbread you can eat
At Southtown, USA

Southtown, Southtown
I'm coming home
Oh, how I'm yearning for
Blackeyed peas and a sassafras tea

So I'm going back to my honey shack
In Southtown, Southtown, USA
