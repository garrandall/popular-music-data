Wait
I know you got a lot of shit you like to say
(To say, to say)
Slow it down, think you're getting a little carried away
You're too close to the flame
But you don't wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out
But girl what I can promise is I let you down
So don't put up a fight, you'll get lost in the light

If you keep staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again
I warned you in advance
But you just keep on staring at the Sun

Wait
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me
Now we're free to loving anyone other than me
I try to rewind I reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close, no, let it go
'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight, I got lost in the light

If you keep staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again
I warned you in advance
But you just keep on staring at the Sun

Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say
Today is not your day
You should walk away
But you won't listen, you just keep on

Staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again
I warned you in advance
But you just keep on staring at the Sun
