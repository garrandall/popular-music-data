Before I fall too fast
Kiss me quick, but make it last
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye
Keep it sweet, keep it slow
Let the future pass and don't let go
But tonight, I could fall too soon under this beautiful moonlight


But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me


See this heart won't settle down
Like a child running, scared from a clown
I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams just when I look at you
Run far away, so I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high, 'cause every 'Hello' ends with a 'Goodbye'


But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me


So now you see why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart without a care
But here I go, it's what I feel
And for the first time in my life, I know it's real


But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me
If this is love, please don't break me
I'm giving up, so just catch me
