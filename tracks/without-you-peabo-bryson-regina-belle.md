Yeah, living against the grain
Two hearts sharing one pain
But thanks to love, we got by


I couldn't let my feelings show
Couldn't let you ever know
That the end that seemed so real was just a lie


All the things I did for love
Have turned out so wrong
No matter what I try
Love just magnifies the lie


I just can't live without you
There's just no me without you
I feel so lost without you
I need my arms around you



So glad we found out in time
True love is hard to find
This time we're gonna get it right
We're holding on tight
I won't be misled again
This time the good guys are gonna win
Our love comes so naturally
We were meant to be


Pretending not to care was the hardest thing to fake
A day without your love is more than I can take


I just can't live without you
There's just no me without you
I feel so lost without you
I need my arms around you


Nobody thought we could make it, no
They didn't think our love would have the strength to take it, oh no
The lesson's been hard to learn but we passed every test
After all that we've been through, our love is still standing, baby
Our love is still standing, yes it's still standing


I just can't live without you
There's just no me without you
I feel so lost without you
I need my arms around you

I just can't live without you
There's just no me without you
I feel so lost without you
I need my arms around you
Just can't live my life without you, baby
Just can't live, no, no, without you, no
