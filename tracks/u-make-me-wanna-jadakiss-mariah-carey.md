Let's go, uh huh..

K-i-s-s- me...
Uh and I just wanna make...
Love, love, love
Ya, I love it when u say...
K-i-s-s me...
Uh and I just wanna make...
Love, love, love...

A yo.. the crib got ur friends working
We travel to france for french curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carrys the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks,clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push imma cosign
And if I aint got it already than imma go find it ..
I guess imma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cuz her jewerly box look likes lucky charms
All color stones
And she no that I'm in the hood
But she also nows that I'm coming home
Mr. raspy thought I was in love with money
Till the first time we did the nasty

K-i-s-s- me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love
I love it when u say
K-i-s-s me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love

Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens point of view
And thats why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin in the bed with a pearl long vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiten on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy u whilin

K-i-s-s- me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love
I love it when u say
K-i-s-s me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love

When things was ruff only person I could call was u
Now everything I do I do it all 4 u

Come touch me, come kiss me, come love me neway u wanna boy

N I'm hood as long as I'm close to u
N we doing wut grown folks is suppose to do

Come hold me, come feel me, come take me anyway u wanna baby

A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that u trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought u
That dragged the floor and all the night u sat up
And bagged the raw
Damn I'm thinking that u gotta hate it but yet and still u tolerate
It thats y ma we gotta make it

K-i-s-s- me
Ya and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Ya uh, I love it when u say
K-i-s-s me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
