Backwords words, he got em
Shut up, I'm talking
This time, you'll listen
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You drive, too fast and
I smoke, too much and
My heart, is broken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous
Don't go changing every time
Not for me to comprimise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
Yeah - end of, stop sulking
Get out, you're walkin
Too bad, I've spoken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
Your lies, don't want em
Drop dead, not joking
This thing, is broken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous
Don't go changing every time
Not for me to comprimise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous
Don't go changing every time
Not for me to comprimise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
You're forgiven
Yeah yeah
Drop dead
