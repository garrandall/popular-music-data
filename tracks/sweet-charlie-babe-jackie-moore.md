What a man, what a man
There's a guy that they call sweet charlie babe
(Sweet charlie babe)
Finest man that the Lord has ever made
(Ever made) oh yeah
I was born not to look at his eyes
Many girls have been left hypnotized
Sure he has other girls in town
But he's got enough to spread it around

I'm in love with sweet charlie babe
Oh yes I am
Finest man that the Lord has ever made
Uh huh

He sets fire to this heart of mine
If I had to I would stand in line
I don't care if he has someone else
He's just too good to keep to myself
I'm in love with sweet charlie babe
Oh yeah, oh baby

I'd walk a mile for one second of time
That I could spend with that hunk of mankind

I'm in love, I'm in love with sweet charlie babe
Yeah babe
Finest man, finest man, that the Lord has ever made
Has ever made, babe
I'm in love with sweet charlie babe
Finest man that the Lord has ever made
Oh babe, babe
(Repeat to fade)
