Look at us baby
Up all night
Tearing the love apart
Aren't we the same two
People who lived through the years
In the dark
Oh no
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why
No baby I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Oh no
No baby

When we're crazy
It just ain't right
Cause baby I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Baby hold on tight
You've got to know I'll always love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
You make it harder than it has to be

And I can't tell you why
No I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Every time I try to walk away


Something makes me turn around and stay
It's your love
And it makes me feel real good
So I can't tell you
So I can't tell you
I can't
I can't
I can't tell you
No I can't tell you
(Repeat) I can't tell you why
I love you
Love you, love you
I need your love baby
And so
Won't you help me
Won't you help me
I've gotta tell you why
I've gotta tell you why
I wanna be your only thing
I wanna be your only thing
Tell me why
Tell me why
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
Tell me why
Please tell me why
I can't tell you babyLook at us baby
Up all night
Tearing the love apart
Aren't we the same two
People who lived through the years
In the dark
Oh no
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why
No baby I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Oh no
No baby

When we're crazy
It just ain't right
Cause baby I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Baby hold on tight
You've got to know I'll always love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
You make it harder than it has to be

And I can't tell you why
No I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Every time I try to walk away


Something makes me turn around and stay
It's your love
And it makes me feel real good
So I can't tell you
So I can't tell you
I can't
I can't
I can't tell you
No I can't tell you
(Repeat) I can't tell you why
I love you
Love you, love you
I need your love baby
And so
Won't you help me
Won't you help me
I've gotta tell you why
I've gotta tell you why
I wanna be your only thing
I wanna be your only thing
Tell me why
Tell me why
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
Tell me why
Please tell me why
I can't tell you baby
