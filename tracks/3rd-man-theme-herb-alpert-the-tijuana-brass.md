When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again

Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear
The Third Man Theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past

Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting
Third Man Theme

Carnivals and carousels
And ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights
The dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain

Like new May wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords
And make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why

It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush

A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear
The Third Man Theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again

Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear
The Third Man Theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past

Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting
Third man theme

Carnivals and carousels
And ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights
The dancing lights again will shine

The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new May wine

Strauss waltzes, candle glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords
And make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why

It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush

A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear
The Third Man Theme
