No parking by the sewer sign
Hotdog my razor broke
Water dripping up the spout
But I don't care, let it all hang out

Hanging from a pine tree by my knees
Sunshine through the shade
Nobody knows what it's all about
Too much man, let it all hang out

Saw a man walking upside down
My TV's on the blink
Make Galileo look like a Boy Scout
Sorry about that, let it all hang out

Sleep all day, drive all night
Bring down, can't stop now
Sure ain't no doubt
Keep an open mind, let it all hang out

It's raining inside a big brown moon
How does that mess your baby up
Like eating a reuben sandwich with sauerkraut
Don't stop now baby, let it all hang out

Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out

Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out

Aww yeah
Nothin' but yeah
Wooh
