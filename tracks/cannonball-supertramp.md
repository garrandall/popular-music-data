You're tellin' lies, so don't you criticize
Yeah I got used, all messed up and abused
You let me down, with all your runnin' round
Still you pretend and try to call me friend

don't say a word, I know just what I heard
Yeah you've been loose, you just go no excuse
Just feel my rage, why can't you come of age?

I felt it all, just like a cannonball

Then you got mad, you said that I'm all bad
So what's the use, you lied and that's the truth
You took the key and drove right out on me
I never knew, put all my trust in you

OK that's it, I'm leaving now, I quit
I was unwise, so don't apologize
I paid the price, for taking your advice
I felt it all, just like a cannonball

You can say what you want all day
But I've never been so outraged
I'm washing my hands of you
How could you be so untrue
You know I can't stand no more
You know I can't stand no more
