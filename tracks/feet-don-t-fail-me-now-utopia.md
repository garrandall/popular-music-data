Can't you see
She don't want you around no more
Can't you see
That her hands pointing at the door


Feet don't fail me now
How could anyone stay
Anyone could see it's time to go away
Time to take a powder
Open up your eyes
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed


Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me
Feet don't fail me now
Please don't keep me where I should not be
Feet don't fail me now
Stop pretending that you've gone to sleep
Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me


See your things piled in the hall
Turn around, there's a new picture on the wall


Feet don't fail me now
We're the last ones to know
Anyone could see it's time for us to go
Time to hit the highway
Nothing left to do
But it feels like my shoes
Have been crazy glued


Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me
Feet don't fail me now
Please don't keep me where I should not be
Feet don't fail me now
Stop pretending that you've gone to sleep
Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me


Feet don't fail me now
How could anyone stay
Anyone could see it's time to go away
Time to take a powder
Open up your eyes
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed


Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me
Feet don't fail me now
Please don't keep me where I should not be
Feet don't fail me now
Stop pretending that you've gone to sleep
Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me

Don't make a fool of me
