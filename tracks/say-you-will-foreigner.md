Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you won't
Be mine tonight


I can't sleep I keep dreaming I'm losing you
Feel so alone in the night, scared to open my eyes
I'm in too deep, I'm in over my head this time
Can't get you out of my mind no matter how hard I try
So won't you...


Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you won't
Be my guiding light
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine


I get the feeling I've never been here before
Because no one I've known's ever moved me the way
That you do
And I know this is the real thing
It's all I've been searching for
I've put it all on the line now I'm hoping you feel
That way too
(And if you do) Why don't you...


Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine
Now will you, say you will, you say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you will
You'll be mine tonight


Will you tell me how much I mean to you
Will you say you always will be true
I need more than a come-on sign
So won't you say you will be mine


Now won't you, say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be my guiding light
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine


Come on come on
Say you will make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be mine tonight
