One by one they're turning out the lights
Lord I've been feeding out that jukebox just to get to hold you tight
Guess it's for the best I just put in my last dime
Heard you whisper we meet me again another place another time

The chairs are stacked all on the table and it's closing time they say
I could wait my here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than that lonely room of mine
And the sleepless nights are waiting for another place another time

Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
After I've been holding you oh so close to me
And won't that old stairway be a little hard to climb
To my lonely room to wait for another place another time

And won't that old stairway...
