Now there's a place I go with a boy I know
We're together, gettin' better all the time
And there are words I say when we hide away
Makes him crazy, makes him love me all the time

And no one knows
How love goes
It's a mystery
But it's clear to me
And now

Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna find ya
Love is right behind ya
Love has got a line on you

When I close my eyes
Oh the time slips by
Cause I can see him oh so clearly in my mind

And it's so real, this love I feel
It's a mystery
But it's clear to me
Don't you know that

Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna find ya
Love is right behind ya
Love has got a line you

It's got a line on you
Baby love has got line on you

So some know why
I'm the only one
It's a mystery
But it's clear to see

Whoa tell her that
Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna find ya
Love is right behind ya
Love has got a line on

Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna find ya
Love is right behind you baby
Love has got a line on you

It's got a line on you
It's got a line on you
Love has got a line on you

It's got a line on you
It's gonna find you
Love has got a line on you
