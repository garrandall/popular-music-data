Why
She must come and poses me
In the heat of the night?
Toss and turn me and then disappear

Here
On the edge of obsession
I turn off all the lights and pray
That this fantasy can be real

Night and day
I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through


She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my life

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind


I
I can almost taste her
And smell the scent of her perfume
I wish she were here for me to lay next to

She's so very close
But like every illusion
That's just how it appears

I reach out to touch
And find out there's no one there
Right now I'm going to close my eyes
And go back to where I need to be

Maybe then I'll get to hear her say
She loves me
And will never leave


She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my life

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
Smack dib in the middle of my mind


Night and day
I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through


She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
Smack dib in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind
Girl's in the middle of my life
