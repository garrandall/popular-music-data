La, da, da, da
De de de de de


The moment was custom-made to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul


She said
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

La, da, da
Da, de, de, de, de


Well, I won't lie
I pulled that car right over
And I sat there on the shoulder
Trying to dry my misty eyes

And I whispered
Lord, I wanna thank you for my children
Cause your innocence that fills them
Often takes me by surprise like


Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit
Or are we goin' there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?


Well, I thought about it later on
And a smile came to my face
And when I tucked her in to bed
I got down on my knees and prayed


Lord, when I get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
I don't wanna come to visit
Cause I'm coming home to stay?

And I can't wait to see my family
And meet Jesus face to face
And do you think, Lord
You could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

Mmm
Can I help pour out the rain?
Can I help pour out the rain?

La, da, da, da
De, de, de, de
