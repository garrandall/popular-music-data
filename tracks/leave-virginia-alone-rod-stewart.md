Well I've Seen her
Down the alley
And over the hill
To steel her away
She was as hot as
Georgia asphalt
When the aircraft came
To adore her brain

So leave Virginia alone
Leave Virginia alone
She's not like you
And me
She's not like you
And me
You should've seen her
Back in the city
Poetry and jewels
Broke all the rules
She was as high as
A Georgia palm tree

(1) So Leave Virginia alone
Leave Virginia alone
She's not like you
And me
She's not like you
And me

Some sunny day
When the h... of times have
Gone farewell
You'll understand
Why it was so hard
To run away
To run away

She's a loser
She's a forgiver
She still finds good
When no one could
You want her
More than money
Cadillac can rust
Diamond and dust



Ah, yeah
Leave Virginia alone
Leave Virginia alone
She's not like you
And me
She's not like you
And me

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ,...

La, la, la, leave her alone

Oh, Virginia
Oh, Virginia
Leave her alone
