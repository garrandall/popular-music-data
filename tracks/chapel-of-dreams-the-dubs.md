In the chapel of dreams
Every dream will come true
In the chapel of dreams
There's a dream there for you

Through the dark of the night
Though as strange as it seems
Every heart finds delight
In the chapel of dreams
(Chapel of dreams)

Oh, was until I found
This chapel of reknown
I've searched and searched
For peace of mind

I'm glad that at last
My empty days have passed
Now I worship at the shrine

It is heaven to know
Just what happiness means
It is found at the door
In the chapel of dreams

(Chapel of dreams)
(Chapel of dreams)
(Chapel of dreams)
