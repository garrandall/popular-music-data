Hey, yeah ya know what?
I like the players
No diggity, no doubt
Play on play that
Play on play that
Yo Dre drop the verse


It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB collab creations Funk like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ear-gasms with my mellow accent
Still moving his flavor with the homies Blackstreet & Teddy
The original rump shakers


Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10,
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win


I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up girl)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up


She's got class and style
Street knowledge, buy the pound
Baby never act wild,
very low key on the profile
Catching villains is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word,
spin's the verb
Lovers it curves
so freak what you heard

Rolling with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, everyday
You're blowing my mind,
maybe in time
Baby I can get you with my ride



Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
(hey yo that girl looks good)
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
(play on play on player)
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
(you're my kind of girl)
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo


Cause that's my peeps and we rows "D"
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me
Not a (motherfuckin') thing
Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty
Ask for me
> Icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on this scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
High shows and proves, no doubt
I be diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how a player's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital "G"
Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be
Word is born
Faking moves never been my thing
So Teddy pass the word to your (nigga) Chauncey
I'll be sending a car, lets say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity



Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo

Yeah, Come on
Jackie in full effect
Lisa in full effect
Nicky in full effect
Tomeka in full effect
Ladies in full effect
Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent
Yeah play on play that
Play on play on
Cause I like it
No diggity, no doubt, yeah
Blackstreet productions
We out, we out right
We out, we out...
