You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you’ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me


So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you


It was ’94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart


So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you


I don’t know what I’d if you left me
(So please don’t go away)
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today


So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher (you higher)
'Cause I, I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (I still turn to you)
Yeah-Yeah
Cause I
I turn to you
