Well, it's two a.m. in Nashville
Midnight in L.A.
You're asleep and
I'm out on the road

And I know that you can't hear me
But I'm talking anyway
It helps me kill some time
Ease the load

Hon, the man didn't like my song
And he sent me on my way
And I put my bus fare
On that tootie's bar

I'm out on Murfreesboro Road
Hitchhiking to L.A.
And the rain's pouring down
On my guitar

Honey, dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Won't you dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Well, no one wants to help out
The longhair hippie freak
At two a.m. in Nashville, Tennessee

They threw me out of the truck stop
And I got no place to sleep
If this freedom, Lord
It ain't for me

Hon, I'm hanging up
My Nashville dream
As soon as I get home
And I'll share my songs
With no one else but you

We'll sing 'em up together
They'll be mine and yours alone
I'll be all the things
You wanted me to

If you'll just
Dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Honey, dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Baby, dream, dream me home
Dream, dream me home
I wish you would
Dream, dream me home

Come on, baby
Dream, dream me home
Baby, baby...
