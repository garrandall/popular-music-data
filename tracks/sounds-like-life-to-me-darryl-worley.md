Got a call last night from an old friendâs wife
Said I hate to bother you
Johnny Ray fell off the wagon
Heâs been gone all afternoon
I know my buddy so I drove to Skullyâs
And found him at the bar
I say hey man, whatâs going on
He said I donât know where to start 

Sarahâs old carâs about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the babyâs cutting teeth
I didnât get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ainât what you wanna hear
But itâs what Iâm gonna say 


Sounds like life to me it ainât no fantasy
Itâs just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know itâs tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk youâre caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me 

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you donât understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And Iâm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarahâs 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate 


Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride
Get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life 

Man I know its tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk youâre caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life
