Blind man standing on the corner
Crying out the blues
Said, "I don't need a dollar, and don't you give me a dime
Until you bring back that little girl of mine"
I can't let her go, I'm hooked, I can't let her go
People try to tell me, "Stop crying, and find you someone new
'Cause when that good Lord made one woman
Hallelujah, don't you know he made two"
But I can't let her go, I'm hooked, I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Lord, I can't let her go
He lifted up his head toward heaven and said
"Good Lord, I'd rather die than to let a no-good
A no-good cheating woman make me stand on the corner and cry"
Lord knows, I'm living in a world of darkness
But that don't, that don't bother me
And until I find that sweet little girl of mine
Lord knows, I just don't want to see
But I can't let her go, Lord I'm hooked
I can't let her go, Lord, I can't let her go
Won't somebody please help the blind me
Lord, won't somebody please help the blind me
I can't let her go, I'm hooked, I can't let her go
