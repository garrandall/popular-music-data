Meet me at my door
By the end of the night
You'll be screaming for more more more of me
Tonights a big night, so lets make history.

My lips touch your lips
My hands is on your hips
Whats it gonna take for you to give me my goodnight kiss?

Oh. Whooa
My heart is beating fast but my hands are moving slow
Oh. Whooa
Feels so right you just cant say no

Late night gonna hit the town
Gonna take you out
Gonna make you go
Whooaa. Midnight romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna feel you head to toe
You know,
I'm your midnight romeo

I'll be your Dr. Jekyll, and you be my Mr. Hyde
The best of both worlds when you get inside my place place place with me
You be the lock, yeah I'll be the key
Tonights about to win
Tell me baby, are we more than friends
Tonight your dinner is free
Whats in it for me?

Oh. Whooa
My heart is beating fast but my hands are moving slow
Oh. Whooa
Feels so right you just cant say no

Late night gonna hit the town
Gonna take you out
Gonna make you go
Whooaa. Midnight romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna feel it head to toe
You know, I'm your midnight romeo

Show me yours and I'll show you mine
I'm gonna make you sweat
Gonna be your romeooooooo
Whooa.
Whoooaoo

Late night gonna hit the town
Gonna take you out
Gonna make you go
Whooooaa

Late night gonna hit the town
Gonna take you out
Gonna make you go
Whooaa. Midnight romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna feel you head to toe
You know, I'm your midnight romeoooo

Head to toe, you know
Midnight Romeo
Head to toe, you know
Midnight romeo!
