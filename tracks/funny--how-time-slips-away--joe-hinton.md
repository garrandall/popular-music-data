Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How'm I doin'?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now
An' it seems like it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away?
How's your new love?
Gee, I hope he's doin' fine
I heard ya told him
That you'd love till the end of time
Well, that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny how time just slips away?
I gotta go now
Guess I'll see you 'round
I don't know when, though
I never know when I'll be back in town
Now remember whatcha told me
That "In time you're gonna pay"
And it's surprisin' how time slips away
