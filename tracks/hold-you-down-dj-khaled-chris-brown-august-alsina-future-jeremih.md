I'll hold you down
I'm on my way (DJ Khaled!)


All you've been thinking about
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (rule your mind)
(we the best music)
And now you say you dream about doing it anywhere
Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind (on your mind)
(another one)

Sit in my whip and see the stars (and see the stars)
Show me just who you are (show me just who you are)
You know who really hold you down (hold you down)
And when you not around (and when you not around)


I'll hold you down
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
(Some rollin' up)
Want you like right now
(You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me babe)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)


I had some problems back home (so I heated up)
I ain't with that bullshit at all (then I laid it down)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (nigga say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard
Oh but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of ya'll for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
And I'll hold you down, (I'mma hold you down)
I'mma hold you down baby


I'll hold you down
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
(Some rollin' up)
Want you like right now
(You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me babe)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, bitch, I'm the one gon' hold you down)


I'm the one gon' hold you down
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roads is down, you mesmerized by the flying sky
We gotta socialize and cherish times
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck

We've been playing in that Versace
I swear
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby
Your body my new Bugatti


I'll hold you down
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
(Some rollin' up)
Want you like right now
(You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me babe)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)


Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started
I get instant hype 'cause you forever my lady
Forever my baby (real life)
Hold you down, hold you down
Girl you helped me up when I was down
In and out, girl
Hold you down like I'm supposed to
Real nigga, I know you,
real nigga, I know you (another one)


I'll hold you down
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
(Some rollin' up)
Want you like right now
(You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me babe)
I'm on my way
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)
