You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away
But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never,
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at the party
Good at the bar
Somethin' 'bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're lookin' so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby, yeah
