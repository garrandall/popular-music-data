I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig the buried treasures
I know, exactly how I feel


Don't want to live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe
In the falling rain


Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself


I went walking through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends






I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long, as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name



 repeat x3
