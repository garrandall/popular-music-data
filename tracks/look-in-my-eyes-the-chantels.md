Yo, aight
Hardy, Hardy Caprio
Big up everyone
Yo

In my life had a caption
2 cherry b's and a magnum
I've had green on my head like zoro
Lord know's I don't wanna go back to transactions
Cause it got hot like chantelle jeffreys
It's all mad when you see another man get bad
And you thinking I can't sit back but
I can't face time like samsungs
I got tunes online there's traction
Man come from the block, no mansion
New schemes I'm plankton
But I can't be a patty going off on a tangent
Mmm, I'm south London like morleys
But I got meego's up in north achton
They finesse like chicks in north hampton
Dohs are the bruddha's that I bank on
Might fly there if I wanna get banks in
Fuck what happened
I'm whats happening
I see everybody out there chattin
But me I was going on cold, I'm trappin
Mumzy said 'Wha what happened?'
Island girl got a man saying plantain
I get love from the white and the black tings
XXX saying naomibanxxxing

I'm back in effect
Last week I was in ends in a dealo
Friday, hittin more cells than chemo
And then it's back to the west near Heathrow
I see yous with egos
Huh?
Why dem boy got egos?
Huh?
He started a lie last year
Now there's rumours he turned to a cat like sneakbo
Psssh

Mad
I got the juice dey ain't
Got bits like mine
They from the bits
But they ain't bits like mine
Never popped off done bits like mine
Heard your ting is a beat like mine
Your G's wanna be a beat like mine
New tune that's a beat like mine
Cuz your hoping that it does bits like mine
I'm not Bryson Tiller I'm more Tory
I'm not Torey tho I'm more labour
I'm not into the party I'm grinding
More, more money more paper
More, more money more pagans
More dogs when I ask for a favour
Man can't chat to me like that chat to me
Anyhow rudeboy chat to me later

Came up hood
Know whats bad, say what's good
Man can't walk in my size 8 boogz
I'm a scumbag used to get brain in the woods
Now I've grown, I've changed and I'm stush
I throw that back like a 5 day pass
They say I'm blunt
I say that I'm kush
Girls never like me for the way that I look look
Dem man a jokers, Borat
Dem man are holders, hopeless all dat
Dem man are still on drawers and all dat
Q's they're still up in the queue yeah all dat
Man came with a brand new format
Now I got bare man on my ballsack
Bare Wahgwarns, yo's yeah all dat
Got man stretching arms like straw hat
I've had bags on my eyes like Gara
Going in since 2 double 0
Hollywood ting, man come like hollyoaks
Bare G A Y man like hollyoaks
I got tunes on the side yeah they wanna know
New EP, new tings yeah they wanna know
Where's that tune with dave yeah they wanna know
Got man giving us eyes like obito
Hollywood hard, heartbreak H
I go there but I can't stay late
6 outta 10, I'm a 6 outta 10
But I still do bits so they can't say nay
Hollywood hard, heartbreak H
I go there but I can't stay late
6 outta 10, I'm a 6 outta 10
But look real close might turn to a 8
Yo...
