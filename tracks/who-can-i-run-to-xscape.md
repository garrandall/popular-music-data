As I stand here contemplating
On the right thing to decide
Will I take the wrong direction
All my life, where will I go
What lies ahead of me?


I have strong determination
And I'm not afraid of change
I have yet to find that someone
Who would care to satisfy me
To stay right by me


Who can I run to
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to
When I need love?
Who can I run to
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to
When I need love?


And my mind is so confusing
Who would be that special one?
Everyday I'm trying to find you
All along, I've got to know
Is there a place for me?


I know love has many meanings
And a message very clear
All it takes is time and patience
To bring you near
But who got me, tell me
