I got my suitcase in my hand
I walk alone, alone and mad
You lied to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill

If my friends should ask for me
You'll know just where I'm gonna be
You lied to me, now I had my fill
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill

I guess I'm going, join the many
Cause I know there's a plenty
Million hearts all alone and
They call heartbreak hill their home

Maybe in time, I'll get by
Then I'll learn not to cry
You lied to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill

I guess I'll go, join the plenty
Cause I know there's a many
Million hearts all alone and
They call heartbreak hill their home

Maybe in time, I'll get by
Then I'll learn not to cry
You lied to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill
