Oh! OhI want to find a better place
Oh! OhI'm searching for a better place

Oh! OhI'm tired of living in the sand
Oh! OhI'm searching for a better land

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never - never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place

Oh! OhI'm always trying to escape
Oh! OhI never know which road to take

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place

Live in this place

Live in this place, this place

Oh! OhI want to find a better place
Oh! OhI'm searching for a better place

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place (don't wanna live)

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere (must be there-ere)
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere (must be there-ere)
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place (fade
