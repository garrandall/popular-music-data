Heart in my mouth, but my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
Iâm realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate

I just know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is electric, it heightens the senses
I can feel it charging
Iâll never forget it, weâre transcending
And I know weâve started

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate

Heart in my mouth, but my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
Iâm realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate

I just know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can levitate
I can levitate

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate
