My feeling goes around
And upside down
I said, oop de doo doo
Feeling goes around
And upside down
I said, oop de doo doo

Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong

My heart's full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

I'll tell you, my darling
I don't know what to do

I want to try, try, baby
Love me one more time
Try, try, baby
Love me one more time

I swear, pretty baby
I'll drive you out of your mind

Yes, I'm on my knees, baby
And it's more than I can take
I'm on my knees, baby
And it's more than I can take

Come back, baby
Give my heart another break

My feeling goes around
And upside down
I said, oop de doo doo
Feeling goes around
And upside down
I said, oop de doo doo
My feeling goes around
And upside down
I said, oop de doo doo

Yes, I'm on my knees, baby
And it's more than I can take
I'm on my knees, baby
And it's more than I can take

Come back, baby
Give my heart another break

Yeah, try, try, I said try
Try, I said try, try, try, try
Try, try, try, love me one more time
