Everyone considered him
The coward of the county.
He'd never stood one single time
To prove the county wrong.
His mama named him Tommy,
But folks just called him Yellow.
Something always told me
They were reading Tommy wrong.

He was only ten years old
When his daddy died in prison.
I looked after Tommy
'Cause he was my brother's son.
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy,
"Son, my life is over,
But yours has just begun.

Promise me, son,
Not to do the things I've done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek.
I hope you're old enough to understand:
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man."

There's someone for everyone,
And Tommy's love was Becky.
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was working
The Gatlin boys came calling.
They took turns at Becky.
There was three of them.

Tommy opened up the door
And saw his Becky crying.
The torn dress, the shattered look
Was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace
And took down his daddy's picture.
As his tears fell on his daddy's face
He heard these words again,

"Promise me, son,
Not to do the things I've done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
Now it won't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek.
I hope you're old enough to understand:
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man."

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the bar room.
One of them got up
And met him half way 'cross the floor.
When Tommy turned around they said,
"Hey, look, old Yellow's leaving."
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door.

Twenty years of crawling
Was bottled up inside him.
He wasn't holding nothing back,
He let 'em have it all.
When Tommy left the bar room
Not a Gatlin boy was standing.
He said, "This one's for Becky,"
As he watched the last one fall.
N' I heard him say,

"I promised you, Dad,
Not to do the things you've done.
I walk away from trouble when I can.
Now please don't think I'm weak.
I didn't turn the other cheek.
And, Papa, I sure hope you understand:
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man."

Everyone considered him
The coward of the county.
