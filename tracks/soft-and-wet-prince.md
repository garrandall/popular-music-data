Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I wanna lose in you,
Baby can you stand the pain
Hey, lover, sugar don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooo baby!
All I wanna see is the love in your eyes (hey, lover)
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
All I wanna feel is burning flames (hey, lover)
Tell me, tell me, baby, that U feel the same
Tell me that U feel the same way I do
Tell me that U love me girl

[We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way)
U feel so wrong, be alone, if u just follow somebody someday]

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooo weee, baby. you leave me without...
Breath! Ooo, baby! Oooo, yeah

You're just as soft as a lion tamed (hey, lover)
You're just as wet as the evening rain
How will I take it when you call my name? (hey, lover)
Your love is driving me...
you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby
Oh, girl
Crazy 'bout your love

Soft and wet (U know)
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Soft and wet
