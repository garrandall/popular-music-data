Well the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street, there is danger at your door
Think this through with me, let me know your mind
Wo, oh, what I want to know, is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend; better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Will you come with me? Won't you come with me?
Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?

Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like?
Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is "Don't tread on me"
Come hear Uncle John'n Band playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it Beggar's Tomb
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home

Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go

Come hear Uncle John's Band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
