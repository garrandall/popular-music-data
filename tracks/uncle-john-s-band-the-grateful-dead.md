Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Will you come with me?

Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide



It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home



Whoa-oh what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
