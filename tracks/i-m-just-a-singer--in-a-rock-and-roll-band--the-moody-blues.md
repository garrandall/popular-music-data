I'm just a-wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling, I hear so many words
Language barriers broken, now we've found the key

And if you want the wind of change to blow about you
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

A thousand pictures can be drawn from one word
Only who is the artist, we got to agree
A thousand miles can lead so many ways
Just to know who is driving, what a help it would be

So if you want this world of yours to turn about you
And you can see exactly what to do, please tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

How can we understand
Riots by the people, for the people
Who are only destroying themselves?
And when you see a frightened person
Who is frightened by the people
Who are scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)
Scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)

I'm just a-wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling, I hear so many words
Language barriers broken, now we've found the key

And if you want the wind of change to blow about you
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

How can we understand
Riots by the people, for the people
Who are only destroying themselves?
And when you see a frightened person
Who is frightened by the people
Who are scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)
Scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)

Music is the traveler, crossing our world
Meeting so many people, bridging the seas

I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

Music is the traveler, crossing our world
Meeting so many people, bridging the seas

I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
We're just the singers in a rock and roll band
