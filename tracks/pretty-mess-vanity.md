Ah

Here we go again falling on my bed and pulling on a pillow
Well I think you got what it takes to get me boiling like a kettle
Here everything's boiling up
I boil to the maximum,yeah
Well I do believe babe,you boil me bubbling
You get me in so much trouble
Oh and baby someday soon
I will take you there
Promise you the moon
And then he pulled a seam and it went all the way

Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
He made such a pretty mess on my dress
Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
Such a pretty
Here we go again,pulling on my hair
I'm dripping like a hot tea
I'm aware if you drip it too hot
It just might spill all over this lovely
Here everything's boiling up
I boil to the maximum,yeah
Well I do believe babe,you boil me bubbling
You get me in double trouble
Oh and baby someday soon
I will take you there
Promise you the moon
And then I took a drink and it went all the way

Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
We've made such a pretty mess of my dress
Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
Oh such a pretty
Here we go again,crawling through the kitchen...oh ho ho hum
I bet you got what it takes to get me into a living room position
Oh and baby someday soon
I will take you there
Promise me the moon
And then he found a hallway that went all the way

Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
He made such a pretty mess of my dress
Oh yeah,such a pretty mess
Oh it's such a pretty
