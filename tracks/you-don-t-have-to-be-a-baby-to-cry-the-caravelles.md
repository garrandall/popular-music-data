You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry
All you need is for love to go wrong
You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry
Or to lie awake the wh-o-le ni-i-ght long

When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears

These ain't rainbows in my eyes, why should I lie
You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry

When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears

These ain't rainbows in my eyes, why should I lie
You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry
You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry
You don't have to be a ba-a-aby to cry
