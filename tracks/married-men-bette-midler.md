The world is full of married men
with wives who never understand.
They're looking for someone to share
the excitement of a love affair.

And just as soon as they find you
they'll wine you and dine you.
Fly on the wings of romance.
But in the eyes of the world
you're just another girl
who loves a married man.

Uh! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
again and again.
Ow! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.

Oh, you make him feel so young,
but his wife is still the number one.
He promises to marry you.
Yeah, just as soon as his divorce comes through.

Whoa, it's not just a fling,
he swears it's the real thing,
a love that will last 'til the end.
But as he's driving away
you know it's true what they say
about a, a married man.

They say they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
again and again.
Wooo, they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.

Ah, he'll run when the scandal
gets too hot to handle.
He'll say he just wants to be friends.
And then he'll walk outta your life
and go home to his wife
'cause he's a married man.

Oh, your love is a secret.
You've got to sneak it
long as you can.
Don't cry for your lover.
There's always another
married man! Married men!

They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Married, married men.
Ah! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.

The world is full of them.
Girls, now listen.
They're hungry. Don't trust a . . .
Oh, the world is full of them.
The world is full of them!

They do it, they do it, they do it, do it
again and again.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Oh girl, these married men.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
again and again.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Can't help but lovin'.
Oh, honey, they do it and then they do it again.
Oh, make you feel real good!
Ow! They do it and then they do it again.
They love you and leave you

(Nasty, nasty married men)
I know! The world is full of them.
The world is full of them!
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Whoa, I love a . . .
Ah! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Don't trust a . . .

Oh, you make him feel so young,
but his wife is still number one.
He promises to marry you.

I know! The world is ful of them!
The world is full of them!
They do it, they do it, they do t, they do it.
Whoa, I love a . . .
Ah! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it!

Ow! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it!
Bum's gonna hurt you, destroy you!
Yeah! They do it, they do it.
They're gonna do it, do it to you.
Married men, married men.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.

Please! They do it and then they do it again!
Again and again and again!
They do it, I don't care what you do!
Take off that mask, old boy!
You did not listen to me, baby! . . .
