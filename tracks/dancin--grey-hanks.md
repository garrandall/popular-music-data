Love to see you dancing
Love to see you party now
Love to see you dancing

Piano break

Love to see you dancing
Just love to look at you
Love to see you party now
Until the night is through
Love to see you dancing

Hey Lady!
Come and party with me
Aw aw aw
Don't stop what you're doing.
Up is gettin' down.
Don't stop what you're doing.
Where I wanna need to be
Don't stop what you're doing.
With you beside me

Piano break

(Rap)
You know I been looking at you all night long
I only wanna ask you to dance.
I know you know what to do
Come on

Love to see you dancing
Hey you look fine
Love to see you party now
You made me spill my wine
Love to see you dancing
Oops there goes my mind
Got to dance with you

Don't stop what you're doing.
Come on and party with me
Up is gettin' down.
Don't stop what you're doing.
Up is gettin' down.
Don't stop what you're doing.
Where we need to be
Don't stop what you're doing.

Dance
Gotta keep on
