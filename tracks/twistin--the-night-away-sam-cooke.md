Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin'
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twistin' the night away
He's dancin' with a chick in slacks
She's movin' up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothin' like
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin'
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night

Let's twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
They're twistin' the night away

Here's a fella in blue jeans
Dancin' with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twistin' the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', man
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night

One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
