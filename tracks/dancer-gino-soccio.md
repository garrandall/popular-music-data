Dancer
Let your body free now
Dancer
If you want to feel good
Dancer
Got to get a move on
Dancer
Try to take it higher
Dancer

Dancer
Try to take it higher
Dancer

Dancer
Try to take it higher
Dancer

CHORUS
You never knew the power of your body
But when you keep on dancing to the music
You reach up high into the sky

Dancer
Got to get a move on
Dancer
If you want to feel good
Dancer
Keep your body shaking
Dancer
Try to take it higher
Dancer

Dancer
Dancer
Dancer
Try to take it higher

(Chorus x2)
Dancer
Got to get a move on
Dancer
If you want to feel good...
