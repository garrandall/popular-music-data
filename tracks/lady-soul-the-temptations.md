My lady soul

Laying here beside you, 
Close as we can be. 
I know what this leads to. 
I know what you need. yeah. 

I'm ready to surrender, 
My love, lay it all in your hands. 
Give you my forever. 
Everything I am. 

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul. 
You warm my heart when I go cold. 
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul. 
You are my life, you make me whole. 

My lady soul 

I feel it in your heartbeat. 
Hear it in your cries. 
This is where our hearts meet. 
I see it in your eyes. 

I've been waiting for this moment, 
My love, it's a dream come alive. 
Heaven must have sent me, 
An angel of the night. 

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul. 
You warm my heart when I go cold. 
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul. 
You're my lady soul. 
You are my life, you make me whole. 

Hmm, I've always knew we end up together, 
Right from the very start. 
And I believe we will make it forever. 
It's written right here in my heart. 
Oh yeah. 

You're my, you're my, my lady soul. 
You warm my heart when I get cold. 
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul. 
You are my life, you make me whole. 

My lady soul

O my, my... my lady soul
