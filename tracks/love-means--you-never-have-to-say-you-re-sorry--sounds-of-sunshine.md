Love means you never have to say you're sorry
Love means without a word you understand
Hold me and let the pressures disappear
Kiss me I only need to know you're here

Love means you never have to say you're sorry
Touch me the love I felt is everywhere
I know I'll never be alone again
Love means we'll never really say goodbye

Love means you never have to say you're sorry
Touch me the love I felt is everywhere
I know I'll never be alone again
Love means we'll never really say goodbye
