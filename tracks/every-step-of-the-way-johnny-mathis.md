This is a dream Melinda
Just a mirage, so they say
This whole affair they all declare
Was dreamed every step of the way
You're a mere dream, Melinda
Out for a gay little spin
Telling me lies before my eyes
of days that never have been
There's no Melinda, they say for sure
But don't go Melinda
I know and you know
That you're no mere dream, Melinda
Gone when the dawn gleam is through
You and I know that long ago
before the dream there was you
There once was you
