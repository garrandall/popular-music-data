Clap your hands
Stomp your feet
We're gonna dance
To the limbo beat

Form a line
Take your turn
The easiest dance
That you can learn


Limbo, la la la, limbo
Limbo, la la la, limbo
Limbo, la la la, limbo
Limbo, la la la, limbo

You bend way back
Let yourself go
Hop to the pole
Then you keep real low

Each time through
The pole goes down
You get so low
You touch the ground



Clap your hands
Stomp your feet
We're gonna dance
To the limbo beat

You bend way back
Let yourself go
Hop to the pole
Then you keep real low
