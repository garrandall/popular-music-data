I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
Cause she can be my lady,
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night,
Get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I am


Sight seeing we might be in the
Codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face,
Next semester she transfer to Florida state
Cooking like home-etch for financial aid.
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid .
Remember mean time my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the panantial states Boss
She used to fight with her moms,
Till I sat em both down
Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm,
Now she know she getting sliced
Spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow weed together,
Cheated on her but we still gone be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss


I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
Cause she can be my lady,
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night,
Get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I am


Hear I am and here I go
Why you looking for that other
When you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya,
Now you in the big leagues
A black Steinbrenner who
Wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump
And you can tell him I said it
He was talking a lot at first,
But you can see that dead it
You can see I ain't sweat it,
Hell ill even call him my self
And tell him I dead it naw
Please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryina see if I could put you
On my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit and
That's straight up real talk, all bullshit
Aside she replied
"I Like To Do The Wild Thang"
Action took place at my place
Now my place is her place


I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
Cause she can be my lady,
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night,
Get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I am


Mo better mo cheddar not the man
Off your clothes last sweater (what)
Hoe getter gorilla fuck chuffers,
I went and got mo killers boss
I rock with Niggas like Fabulous cause
He tell the truth baby like Fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Here's spaghetti strapped heals not for amateurs
Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like roxy,
Spark that broccoli walk quite aky
Let me sexy I will save you if you let me.
Fly with me, get high as me
I love the alphabet girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches
We show stoppas, hoes just watching


I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
Cause she can be my lady,
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night,
Get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I am
