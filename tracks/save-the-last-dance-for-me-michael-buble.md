You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye,
Let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand
Beneath the pale moon light

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine,
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much

You can dance, go and carry on
'Til the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he walk you home,
You must tell him "No"

'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine,
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darling, save the last dance for me

So, don't forget who's taking you home
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darling, save the last dance for me

Oh, baby, won't you save the last dance for me?
Oh you make a promise that you'll save the last dance for me
Save the last dance, the very last dance for me.
