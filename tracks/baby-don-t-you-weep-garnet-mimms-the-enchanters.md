Baby, don't you weep
I said, baby, don't you weep
Baby, don't you weep

Said I'm not fooling this time
(Baby, don't you weep)
I'm not going to hurt you no more
(No more) no more (no more)

I said never (never)
I said never (never)
Never, never, never, never

Baby (don't you weep)
Come and get the
Love I offer you
(Baby, don't you weep)
I'll do anything you
Want me to
(Baby, don't you weep)

Not going to hurt you no more
(No more) no more (no more)

I said never (never)
I said never (never)
Never, never, never, never
Baby (don't you weep)

How many times
I've wanted to tell you
Exactly the way I feel
But I put you through
Some heartaches, baby
When I need you
Your love is real

And these tears
Falling from your eyes
Are the last you'll
Ever have to wipe away
So don't be afraid
To love me, darling
Cause I'm really here to stay
Believe me

Come on (yeah) come on
(Yeah) come on (yeah)
Come on (yeah) come on

Baby (don't you weep)
Come and get the
Love I offer you
(Baby, don't you weep)
I'll do anything you
Want me to
(Baby, don't you weep)

I'm not going to
Hurt you no more
(No more) no more (no more)
I said never (nor)
I said never (no)
Never, never, never, never
Baby (don't you weep)

Baby (don't you weep)
I don't want you to
Cry no more, darling
(Baby, don't you weep)...
