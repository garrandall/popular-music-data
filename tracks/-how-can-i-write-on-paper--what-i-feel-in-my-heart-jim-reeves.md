With pen in hand, I try to write this note to you
I know now where I stand but what am I to do
I found so many things to say since we're so far apart
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

How can I write on paper, what I'm feeling deep inside
Words to you would last no longer, then it take tear to dry
A love as sweet as your and mine, deserve another start
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

Those simple things you gave are worth the world to me
And each up when I cling to you can take memories
So many things were left unsaid, I don't know where to start
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

How can I write on paper, what I'm feeling deep inside
Words to you would last no longer, then it take tear to dry
A love as sweet as your and mine, deserve another start
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?
