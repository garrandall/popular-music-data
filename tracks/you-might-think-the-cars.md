You might think I'm crazy to hang around with you
Maybe you think I'm lucky to have something to do
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child


You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you


You might think it's hysterical, but I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies, and everything's so deep
But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile


You might think it's foolish
What you put me through (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
All I want is you


And it was hard, so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape
But you kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going


Well, you might think I'm delirious the way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes, when you're curious, I'll be back around
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled


You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
