I've been alone inside myself, far too long
Never really wanted it that way, but I let it happen
If I could do it all again, my life would be infinitely better than before
I wouldn't waste a moment
Make time for laughing with my friends
Make love, make music, make amends
Try to make a difference, try to love, try to understand
Instead of just giving up, I'd use the power at my command


That's why there's always tomorrow, to start over again
Things will never stay the same, the only one sure thing is change.
That's why there's always tomorrow

I guess it took a little time, for me to see
The reason I was born into this world,
And what I'd have to go through
For I've finally realized, that I could beinfinitely better than before, definitely stronger
I'll face whatever comes my way, savor each moment of the day,
Love as many people as I can along the way
Help someone who's given up, if it's just to raise my eyes and pray



Before your last setting sun
And everything your heart has longed for 
Has yet to be (one)
Yes there's always tomorrow though people come and they go
But if you've brought some love to their lives
Then you've got something to show
