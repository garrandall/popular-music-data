Heaven only knows where you've been
But I don't really need to know
I know where you're gonna go

On my heart where you're resting your head
And you just look so beautiful
Just like you were an angel

Can I stop the flow of time?
Can I swim in your divine?
'Cause I don't think I'd ever leave this place

Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you breathing slow

'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids
Tryna find an island in the flood
Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low
Oh


Moon light, mood lights, moves like J-Lo
Tell me what you want from me
I'll do it if you say so
'Cause you're the only one for me
I'm never gonna say "No"
I found me an angel
I can see it in your halo
Have you ever dreamt of what we can do?
Have you ever sent an "I love you"?
I've never felt the feelings that I feel for you
So, maybe we can make a "we" of "me" and "you"
I'mma treat you right tonight
Let's make it last forever
I promise you that no one else will ever treat you better
And if you don't believe me
Please see I don't need no effort
All you gotta do is flip that switch before we bed up

Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you breathing slow
Oh

'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids
Tryna find an island in the flood
Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low

Turn the lights down low

And I would give you everything, baby
But can you feel this energy? Take it
And you can have the best of me, baby

And I would give you everything
But can you feel this energy? Take it
And you can have the best of me, baby

Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you breathing slow

Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you breathing slow

'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids
Tryna find an island in the flood
Oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low

Oh
Turn the lights down low
