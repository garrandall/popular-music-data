Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better


And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide


And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues


Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man


Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself


And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself


And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues


(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
