ayo ne-yo wut up son,

i need you to tell me somthin real quick
check the joint but weezles round me
and all that you no i keep mad
not even wanna be fresh tho
but i got my eye on this won chick you na mean
i dont even wanna be bothered with these weezles
like that u know got that chance
to be up under my wing though
na mean let me know
how you handle your situation right quick


When Im single it dont really matter who it is (no)
Or how many I descide to kick it wit (no)
Long as she can understand how I do it
Im a man with a very healthy appitite for chicks
But when I settle down, find a woman to live for (yea)
Still may be a couple cutties at my door (yea)
Thinkin we can get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell her It cant be like that no more


Girl...you know I got a girl
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that
baby You fine.....baby you'z a dime
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that


Understand baby girl im a totaly new man (yea)
I dont live to crush as many as I can (no moe')
Found a girl that change my whole game plan
She the one (she the one) Only one that Im wantin' (yea)
And I know..girl I know that you really want it bad (yea)
I'd be liein' if I said I wasent tempted
All the things we use to do I kinda miss it
It aint nothing you can give as good as this is


Girl...you know I got a girl
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that
You fine.....baby you'z a dime
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that


ayo im layed back,
on the couch chain out watchin the rain,
hit the window pain when my lotto numbers came out,
just last month told my boo to listen
take off your scarf, gloves,
and hat i got things i needa hear out,
see memba that time in the grand marques
we was poppin mad pain up in the grandpa suit,
and a that night we mad love
and the phone rang twice,
and a
you answerd it and
you asked me who the bitch was,
stephany i met her at the coffee shop
spirtiualy we connected from the day we poped,
a swear to god there no other women
that made me feel wut i feel,
or see wut i see,
this girl brought chills to me,
and the thought of losing you yo is killig me,
your babys father be hoggin
gettin all my time you see i love you yo
you my nigga for life but if it wasnt for sqribs
word to my momma you probrarly be my wife


Baby, all I can say is im sorry
Since I found you me lady (my lady)
To think about cheatin' would be crazy
I dont get down...
Baby, all I can say is im sorry
Since I found me my lady
To think about cheatin' would be crazy
I dont get downnnn...


Girl...you know I got a girl
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that
You fine.....baby you'z a dime
But I just dont get down like that, I dont get down like that
