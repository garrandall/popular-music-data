You and I in this moment, holding the night so close 
Hanging on still unbroken, while outside the thunder rolls 

Listen now, you can hear our heart beat
Warm against life's bitter cold... these are the days 
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me, that rattle the house like wind 
Both of us so unbending, we battle the fear within 
All the while, life is rushing by us hold it now and don't let go 
These are the days, the sweetest days we'll know 

So we whisper a dream here in the darkness 
Watching the stars til they're gone 
And when even the memories have all faded away 
These days go on and on 

Listen now you can hear our heartbeat 
Hold me now and don't let go 
These are the days 
Every day is the sweetest day we'll know 

The sweetest days we'll know
