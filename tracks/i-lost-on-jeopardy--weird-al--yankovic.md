I was there to match my intellect on national TV
Against a plumber, oh and an architect, both with a PhD
I was tense, I was nervous, I guess it just wasn't my night
Art Fleming gave the answers
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right-ight-ight

I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh

Well, I knew I was in trouble now
My hope of winning sank
Oh, 'cause I got the Daily Double now
And then my mind went blank
I took Potpourri for one hundred
And then my head started to spin
Well, I'm givin' up, Don Pardo
Just tell me now what I didn't win, yeah, yeah

I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh


That's right, Al - you lost
And let me tell you what you didn't win: a twenty set volume of the Encyclopedia International
A case of Turtle Wax, and a years supply of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco Treat
But that's not all, you also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people
And you brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come
You don't get to come back tomorrow
You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game
You're a complete loser!

Don't know what I was thinkin' of
I guess I just wasn't to bright
Well, I sure hope I do better
Next weekend on the Price Is Right-ight-ight

I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, oh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
