I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'
But he ain't got nothing on you

I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, ah


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder roll in
It makes you move a little closer to me
And girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep

We can worry bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on
Baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere
I'm all yours tonight


It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do
Ohhh oh oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh
