Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go, go, go, go, go

You gotta get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time
The minute you walk in the room I break into a sweat
My hands begin to shake so bad I can't light my cigarrette
Then you start walkin' towards me and my cool comes all undone
If I could get my feet to move I'd turn around and run
My pulse is beatin' faster And I'm headin' for disaster
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go
Get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time

One kiss from you and my whole body starts to actin' strange
You shake up all my senses, yeah, you tie me up in chains
This chemical reaction isn't easy to define
You drive me to distraction, you disturb my peace of mind
You got me spinning like a top now
And I don't know how to stop now
Is this what love's all about
Lately I feel so without
Wild sensations
Sweet frustrations
You get me goin' and theres no slowin' me down
Here I go Whoa here I go, go Whoa, Here I go, go, go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
