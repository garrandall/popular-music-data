I put a spell on you, because you´re mine
You´d better stop the things that you do
I ain´t lyin´, no I ain´t lyin´, yeah!
I just can´t stand it, baby, for you´re always runnin´ around
I can´t stand it the way you´re always puttin´ me down
I put a spell on you, because you´re mine

I put a spell on you, because you´re mine
You´d better stop the things that you do
Lord knows I ain´t lyin´, said I ain´t lyin´
I just can´t stand it, baby, the way you´re always tryin´ to put me down
I just can´t stand it the way you´re always runnin´ ´round
I put a spell on you, because you´re mine
Because you´re mine



I said I love you, I love you, I love you, oh baby how
I don´t care if you don´t want me
I said I´m yours, I´m yours right now
I put a spell on you, because you´re mine
I put a spell on you
I just can´t stand the way you´re always tryin´ to put me down
I put a spell on you, oh yeah
I put a spell on you, I put a spell on you
