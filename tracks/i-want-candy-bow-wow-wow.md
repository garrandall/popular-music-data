I know a guy who's tough but sweet
He's so fine, he can't be beat
He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want candy
I want candy

Go to see him when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer boy in town
You're my guy, you're what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water

I want candy
I want candy
Yeah!

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time

I want candy
I want candy

I want candy
I want candy

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
