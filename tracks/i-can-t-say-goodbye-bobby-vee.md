I memorized the words
I'm gonna say to you
To tell you that
I just don't love you anymore

But though my lines
Have been rehearsed so well
They slip my mind
When you walk the door

Cause when I see your face, I realize
No matter how you make me blue
I just can't say goodbye to you

When I'm alone, I say
I can't go on this way
A fool could see
You really love another guy

But when I hear you say
That it's me you love
My foolish heart believes
It's not another lie

'Cause when you're in my arms
My heart forgets all the times
You've made me blue, oh oh
And I can't say goodbye to you
No, I can't say goodbye to you
