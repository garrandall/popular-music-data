Good morning starshine
The earth says "hello" (the earth says "hello")
You twinkle above us (twinkle above us)
We twinkle below (we twinkle below)
Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singin' song

Gliddy glub gloopy, nibby nabby noopy
La la la lo lo
Sabba sibby sabba, nooby abba nabba
Le le lo lo
Tooby ooby walla, nooby abba nabba
Early morning singin' song

Good morning starshine
The earth says "hello" (the earth says "hello")
You twinkle above us (twinkle above us)
We twinkle below (we twinkle below)
Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singin' song

Singin' a song, lovin' a song
Singin' a song
Lovin' a song, laughin' a song
Singin' a song

Sing a song, song a-singing
Song song song sing...
