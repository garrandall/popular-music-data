1-2-1-2-3-4


Give me more loving than I've ever had
Make it all better when I'm feeling sad
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely gettin' mad
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy


It's as easy as 1-2-1-2-3-4
There's only
One thing (one)
To do (two)
Three words (three)
For you... (four)
(I love you) I love you
There's only
One way (one)
To say (two)
Those three words (three)
And that's what I'll do... (four)
(I love you) I love you


Give me more loving from the very start
Piece me back together when I fall apart
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Best that I've had
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy


It's as easy as 1-2-1-2-3-4
There's only
One thing (one)
To do (two)
Three words (three)
For you... (four)
(I love you) I love you
There's only
One way (one)
To say (two)
Those three words (three)
And that's what I'll do... (four)
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you


You make it easy


It's easy as 1-2-1-2-3-4
There's only
One thing (one)
To do (two)
Three words (three)
For you... (four)
(I love you) I love you
There's only
One way (one)
To say (two)
Those three words (three)
That's what I'll do... (four)
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you


1-2-3-4
I love you
(I love you) I love you
