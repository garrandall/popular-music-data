So hot outside all i can wear
Is these cut off overalls
And these sandals on my feet
But i emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
So i could sit there on a broken seat
I got no place i should go
I got no worries you know
Second or seventh street
It doesn't matter to me


'cause you're mine
That's all i need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right cause i've got you to hold
Every night yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

Well i pulled back down to my upstreet apartment
And the air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven and i thought i'd be further along
Than just this rented space
I got no papers to read
I got no cable tv
And i got no places to be
I got no people to meet



I'm on a roll
When i'm with you
Don't stop me now
I just can't lose
