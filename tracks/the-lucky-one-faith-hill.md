So hot outside all I can wear
Is these cut off overalls
And these sandals on my feet
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
So I could sit there on a broken seat
I got no place I should go
I got no worries you know
Second or seventh street
It doesn't matter to me


'cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right cause I've got you to hold
Every night yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

Well I pulled back down to my upstreet apartment
And the air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven and I thought I'd be further along
Than just this rented space
I got no papers to read
I got no cable tv
And I got no places to be
I got no people to meet



I'm on a roll
When I'm with you
Don't stop me now
I just can't lose
