I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to 10
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in my bed


You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same


So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay


Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on (Oh, I)


You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same


So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that gives you
All of the things I could not know
'Cause I keep fighting all the way
I let you down so I could stay


If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go
And, baby, I'll go


You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
