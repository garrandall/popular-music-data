I wouldn't call in the midnight hour
I wouldn't tuck you in and turn the nightlight out
You would walk through the door and I wouldn't say hi
I would walk out the door and wouldn't say bye-bye
It's funny that I never thought about it that way
I never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady


You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time


I wasn't there to help you take your clothes off
When it was time for work didn't see you off
When your tense didn't give a massage
I never told you I think you're hot
It's funny I never thought about it that way
Never knew the things I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady


You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time


When you thought you had to lie
Why didn't you come and tell me why?
Didn't you see those tears I cried?
Oh why?


You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time
(repeat until song ends)
