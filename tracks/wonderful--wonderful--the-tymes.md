Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare
Then your lips cling to mine
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you and you melt in my arms
There we are, darling, only you and I
What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is full of wond'rous things it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet ev'ning I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own
And I say to myself
"It's wonderful, wonderful"
"Oh, so wonderful, my love"

And I say to myself
"It's wonderful, wonderful"
"Oh, so wonderful, my love"
