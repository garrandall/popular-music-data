What's so different? (Uh huh)
Baby (Say what?)
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Yeah (Bom, bom, bom, bom yeah)
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gonna do it to me?
(Can you feel this? Bom bom bom bom, yeah)
I need to tell you something
Check this out
(Uh, Ginuwine, check)

You say you love me.
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you, were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feedin' me, All this rap about,
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about,
You and me, cause this is not how I want it or it should be.


You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

You're creepin' on him for me,
But you say just trust me.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

(Check this out)
Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure,
That he's thinkin'
That you're totally his, but you're here in my my rimmed up drop top with me
All hugged up,
And all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this
To happen to me.
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cause really, this ain't me.



Baby, uh uh uh, uh uh uh (Say what?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)

(Uh, ya see?)
Don't tell him baby
(You don' went too far now, baby)
You won't do this shit to me
(Yo G, bring the bridge in)

Baby tell me one thing
How could you do it?
What did he do to you?
Does he know he blew it?

Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason
(Tell me, tell me)

I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him
(What?)

If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cause tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me?
(Not to me baby)
You would do it to me
