With Count Basie
Don't you know
That's the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
Woah, lord, the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
All day long, they're singing
Don't you know
The sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
Can't you hear them
They're out there working
They're working on the chain gang
All day long, they work so hard
Til the sun is going down
Working on the highway and byways
And wearing, wearing a frown
You'll hear them
Moaning their lives away
Then you might hear
Somebody say now
That's the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
Woah, lord, the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
All day long, they're going
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
Every day, that's the sound of men
They're working on the chain gang
This is what they're saying
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home, yes, I am
See my woman, the one I love so dear
But in the meanwhile, people
You know I gotta work right here
The sound of the men
They're working on the chain...
