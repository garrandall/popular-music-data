Peek-A-Boo, I do love you.
You're the girl for me.
When I look into your eyes
I see my destiny.

Peek-A-Boo, what can I do?
You're so fancy and free.
'Though I try, I can't disguise
The hold you have on me.

I would grow much weaker,
Weather would be bleaker
If I spent a week
Away from Peek-A-Boo.

Peek-A-Boo, I'm telling you
You're the girl of my dreams.
Please don't walk away and put
An end to all my schemes.

I would grow much weaker,
Weather would be bleaker
If I spent a week
Away from Peek-A-Boo.

I said that
I would grow much weaker,
Weather would be bleaker
If I spent a week
Away from Peek-A-Boo.

Peek-A-Boo, I'm telling you
You're the girl of my dreams.
Please don't walk away and put
An end to all my schemes.

Peek-A-Boo, oh dee oh dee oh doh
Peek-A-Boo, oh dee oh dee oh doh
