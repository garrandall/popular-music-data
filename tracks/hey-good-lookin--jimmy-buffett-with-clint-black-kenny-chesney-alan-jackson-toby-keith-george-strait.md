Hey, Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' something up with me


Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe.


I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill

And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come a- long with me.


Say Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'

How's about cookin' somethin' up with me.


Let's stir it up boys.


I'm free and I'm ready
maybe we can go steady

How's about savin' all your time for me

No more lookin',

I know I've been tooken

How's about keepin' steady company.


I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence

And find me one for five or ten cents.

I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age

'Cause I'm writin' your name down on ev'ry page.


Hey, Hey, Good Lookin',

Whatcha got cookin'

How's about cookin' somethin' up with me.

How's about cookin' somethin' up with me.

How's about cookin' somethin' up with me.
