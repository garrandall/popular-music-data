Every dream with you I'll sway, dear
To the Waltz you saved for me
Every dream while I'm away, dear
You'll hear this melody

Whisper goodbye and gently say, dear
That in all the days to be
You will sometimes remember
The Waltz you saved for me

Whisper goodbye and gently say, dear
That in all the days to be
You will sometimes remember
The Waltz you saved for me
