I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I want'a
Right now
Oh, baby

Your love is like a mountain
I'd love to slide down into your canyons
(Slide down)
In the valley of love
(In the valley of love)
I won't rest
(I won't rest)
Until I bring joy and happiness
(Ah)

I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
(Something freakish to me)
Oh, baby
Oh
I want'a
(Something freakish to me)
Baby

All prepostitons of the Zodiac signs
I won't quit until I blow your mind
(Blow my mind)
Compatible am I
(Compatible am I)
I'll hit the spot
(Hit the spot)

In the name of love
Ooh, everything I've got
Ooh Ooh Ooh

Ow!

I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
(Freakish to me)
Oh, baby

I don't want'a stop your image of me
But my style of love is totally free
(Free)
I'll put it where you want it
(Put it where you want it)
As long as you need it
(As long as you need it)
I'll make it good
Mm
And I won't mistreat it
(Ah)

I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
(Something freakish to me)
Oh, baby
Oh
I want'a do something freakish to you right now
(Something freakish to me)
Oh, baby

Get a little freakish, baby
Get a little freakish, baby
(Ah)
Get a little freakish, baby
Get a little freakish, baby
(Oh)

All prepositions of the Zodiac signs
I won't quit, no
(Freakish to me)
Until I blow your mind
I'm compatible as ever
Ooh
I'll hit the spot
Oh, in the name of love
(Something freakish, baby)
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
Ooh, in the name of love
(Freakish, baby)

(Freakish, baby)
(Freakish, baby)
(Get a little freakish, baby)
Oh
Oh
Oh
Get a little freakish, baby
