Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
Never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine
Yes he always had some mighty fine wine
Singing joy to the world
All the boys and girls now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
Throw away the cars and bars and wars
And make sweet love to you
Yes I'd make sweet love to you
Singing joy to the world
All the boys and girls now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flyer and a rainbow rider
A straight shootin' son of a gun
Yes a straight shootin' son of a gun
Singing joy to the world
All the boys and girls now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the world
Joy to you ane me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
