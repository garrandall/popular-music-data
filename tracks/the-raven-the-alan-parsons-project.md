The Clock Struck Midnight
And Through My Sleeping
I Heard A Tapping At My Door
I Looked But Nothing Lay In The Darkness
And So I Turned Inside Once More

To My Amazement
There Stood A Raven
Whose Shadow Hung Above My Door
Then Through The Silence
It Spoke The One Word
That I Shall Hear For Evermore

Quoth The Raven, Nevermore
Thus Quoth The Raven
Nevermore

And Still The Raven
Remains In My Room
No Matter How Much I Implore
No Words Can Soothe Him
No Prayer Remove Him
And I Must Hear For Evermore

Quoth The Raven, Nevermore
Thus Quoth The Raven
Nevermore
