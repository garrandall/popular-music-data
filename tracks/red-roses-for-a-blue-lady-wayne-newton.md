I Want Some
Red roses for a blue lady
Mister florist take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day
Hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away
Wrap up some red roses for a blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick
I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown
