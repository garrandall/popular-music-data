FRANKIE: Gimme a "ho" if you got your funky bus fare

KIDS: Ho! Ho! Ho!

FRANKIE:
There's a double dutch bus coming down the street
Moving pretty fast so kinda shuffle your feet (shk-a-shk)
Get on the bus, pay your fare
Then tell the driver that you're going to a Double Dutch Affair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
Well I'll be darned, here it comes
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street
You'd better get off the curb, move your feet

Bus fare trans-pass
That's the way my money lasts
Ain't got no car to get around
When I go to work, I've gotta go downtown
Now I've missed my train, that's a darn shame
When I'm running late, no sleep's to blame
If you've got a wife, you know I'm right
You got a special man? Well, I can understand
Uptown, downtown everybody's getting down
Say uptown, say downtown
Well, I missed my bus I know I'm late
I gotta do something I know I hate
I'm gonna walk to work fifteen blocks
I already got a hole in my socks
Go ahead and laugh that's okay
Cause what I really wanna say
I got bad feet my corns hurt
To top it off I'm late for work
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealin' wit a funky sidewalk
Let me show you how I walk
When I gotta do my funky walk
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealing wit a funky sidewalk
I say shhhhhhhhhhh-sugarrrrr

BOY: Hizzey, gizzirls! Y'izzall hizzave t' mizzove izzout the wizzay sizzo the gizzuys can plizzay bizzasketbizzal

FRANKIE:
Bip, bomp, bam, alakazam
But only if you're grooving with the Double Dutch Man
Put on your skates, don't forget your rope
Cause I know I'm gonna see you at my Double Dutch Show
Rebecca, Lolita, Veshawn and Dawn
Every time you do the Double Dutch you really turn it on
Bilzarbra, Milzary, Bilzetty, Pilzam
Tilzommy, Tilzerrance, Bilzobby that's my man
Come on get on my Double Dutch Bus
(The Double Dutch Bus)

Let me hear you say do that
(Do that)
Let me hear you say do that again
(Do that again)
Let me hear you say do the do
(Do the do)
Let me hear you say do the do the do
(Do the do the do)
Do the do the do the do do do
(Do the do the do the do do do)
