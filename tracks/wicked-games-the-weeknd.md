I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love, baby, your love
Bring the drugs, baby, the drugs
And I'll bring the shame
Bring the cups, baby, the cups
Bring your body, pretty baby, bring your body
And I'll bring the pain

I'll bring the pain
The pain
I'll bring the pain
I'll bring the pain
And I'll bring, and I'll bring the pain

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
Get you dancing with the Devil
Take a, take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

Bring your love, baby, your love
Bring the drugs, baby, the drugs
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups, baby, the cups
Bring your body, pretty baby, bring your body

Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself

Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
So tell me you love me
