Hold on to the night
Hold me baby until the light slips softly through the curtains drawn, the sun comes up and the magics gone

So hold on to the night hold me baby until the light comes creepin through my window pane

When the day light comes and everybody runs on there way
Talkin about there lives, nothin to say
Well in a hard packed sunlight nothin seems to go right for me
But in the cool of the dark we can be free

Hold on to the night
Hold me baby until the light slips softly through the curtains drawn, the sun comes up and the magics gone

So hold on

When the neon flash's and everbody crash's along
We'll be cruisin the street out on our own

Hold on to the night
Hold me baby until the light comes creepin through my window pane

Comes creepin through my window

Hold on
Hold on Yeh Yeh Yeh
Hold on
Hold on Yeh Yeh Yeh
Hold on
Hold on Yeh Yeh Yeh
Hold on
Hold on Yeh Yeh Yeh
