Somebody loves you
Somebody needs you
Somebody loves you through your tears
Don't you see me standing there
Don't you know I'm the one who cares

Somebody loves you
Somebody needs you
Somebody loves you through your tears
Don't you see me standing there
Don't you know I'm the one who cares

Your eyes are filled with tears
And I know your heart is full of fears
Oh, and there's no one you can talk to
Who understands what you're going through
And if you turn and run away
Don't you know yours won't be the only pain

Somebody loves, oh, somebody loves you
And somebody needs, oh, somebody needs you
Somebody loves you through your tears
Don't you see me standing there
Don't you know I'm the one who cares

You're feeling helpless and so lost
And you've made a mountain of your faults
But no matter how bad things may seem
Through it all, honey, you've still got me
And when your future is lookin' dim
I'll be there to light your way again
And remember

Somebody loves you
And somebody needs
Somebody needs you
The one who loves you
I'm the one who needs, oh
I'm the one who needs you

Somebody loves you
