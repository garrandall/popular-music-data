What would the world be like, y'all
Without, without music
What would the world be like now
Without a song to sing

Just think, no more dancing
No, no, no people dancing to the beat
There'd be no birdy
To wake you in the morning
With a sweet, sweet melody

Oh, cars and buses
Wouldn't have no horns
A baby wouldn't cry
The first day he's born



Now think, there'd be no answer
Blowing in the wind in a shell
Laying by the sea

There'd be no church bells
Ringing in the morning
From the steeple across the street
Now, now look here

A singer wouldn't have a song to sing
Your baby couldn't call cause
The telephone wouldn't ring



Think about this
A singer wouldn't have a song to sing
Your baby couldn't call cause
The telephone wouldn't ring
