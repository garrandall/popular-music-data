Gotta see how far I can go
Gonna make it to the late show
Need to find some new romance, oh, yeah

Then I saw you all alone
And how can I make my feelings known
And not leave it all up to chance?

Oh, should I call your bluff
And let you know what I'm thinkin' of?
It's black and white, I'm not lyin'
If it takes all night, I'll keep on tryin'

Never give up
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up
I've just got to see it through

Had my share of ups and downs
Don't you tell me that I'm out of bounds
You're no master of deception, no, no

I can see what's in your eyes
Kinda makes me wanna fantasize
'Cause I know there's no exceptions, no, no

I'm gonna call your bluff
Just let you know what I'm thinkin' of
It's black and white, honey, I'm not lyin'
If it takes all night I'll keep on tryin'

Never give up
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up
I've just got to be with you

Take a look around you
And see if you can find
Someone who cares about you
A love you can't deny

I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up
I've just got to be with you

I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up
'Till I make this dream come true

I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up
I've just
