Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said "Man, your baby gonna leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed"
That's right

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
But if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river child
And jump overboard and drown
Thats right

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
I said hey, hey baby, hey, hey now
What you trying to do?
Hey, hey baby, hey, hey now
Please don't say we're through

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
But if you stay baby
I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work two jobs, seven days a week
And bring my money home to you
That's right
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Yeah

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
