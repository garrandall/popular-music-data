My baby, she may not look
Like one of those bunnies out of the Playboy book
Well, I'm sorry bout that, Mr. Williams
But she's got something,
Johnny, much greater than gold
Well, now what's that?
I'm crazy 'bout that girl,
She's got so much soul

She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do - ow!
Tell 'em bout it, Watson

My baby now, when she walks by
All the fellows go, and I know why
Have mercy, just look at her walk
It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow

And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
I'd better tell 'em one more thing

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow, tell 'em bout it, Mr. Williams

Now everybody in my neighborhood
An' that's what's grooving me
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Well, let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind
Help 'em to make 'em see
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Mercy, mercy, mercy!
