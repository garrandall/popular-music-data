It was noon time, down time, break time
Summertime, Miller Time, anytime
She was looking pretty fine
A red light, green light, go
All fired upside downtown
She was shaking me all around
I was tuned in, going nowhere, second wind
Jonesing, drooling, feeling good, if you would


Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white t-shirt
Breaker Breaker 1-9 she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose

In like Flynn, I was
Looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey
Baby, where you been
All my life I've been looking for
Someone like you
Falling head over heels
Hey what can I do





Now I'm in the fast lane going 98
By now I know she can
Smooth operate me
I know now she's no goody two shoes
But hey I got myself nothin' to lose



Noon time, down time, break time
Summertime, Miller Time, any time
She was looking pretty fine
In like Flynn I was looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey baby where you been
All my life I been looking for someone like you
Falling head over heels hey what can I do
I got nothin' to lose, yeah
