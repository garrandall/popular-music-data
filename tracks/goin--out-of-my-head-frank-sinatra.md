Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head over you, over you

I want you, want you to want me, I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
I must think of a way into your heart
There's no reason why my being so shy should keep us apart

And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'cause I can't explain the tears that I shed over you, over you

I see you each morning, but you just walk by me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
