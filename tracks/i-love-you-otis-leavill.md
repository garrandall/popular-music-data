Oohhhh, oooo
(Come and get your love)
(Come and get your love)
Here's your love‚ come and get it
I'm not ashamed to admit it
I love you

Here's my heart‚ come and take it
Cause I know we can make it
I love you

I'm not givin' up the fight
After your kiss last night
Girl‚ I know

Now take me for better or for worse
If you wanna
Baby I love you (nobody knows the love I see)

I send you flowers every day
Sooner or later you're getting you way
Now I've given you, you my hand
Let us spread love all over this land

Get it, get it‚ get it, because I want to see you with it
I love you
Oh yeah
Get it, get it‚ get it, because I want to see you with it
I love you

I have given up the fight
After your kiss last night
Now I'm yours
Now take me for better or for worse if you want to
I love you (nobody knows the love I see)

I have given up the fight
After your kiss last night
I love you (nobody knows the love I see)

Now take me for better or for worse if you want to
Baby, I love you (nobody knows the love I see)

Here's your love come and get it
I'm not ashamed to admit it
I love you  (nobody knows the love I see)

Come on and get it, get it, get it
Cause I want to see you with it
I love you  (nobody knows the love I see)
