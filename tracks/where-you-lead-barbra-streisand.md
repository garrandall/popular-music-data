Wanting  you  the  way  I  do
I  only  want  to  be  with  you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause  darling
To me that's what you're worth
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere,  that you tell me to
If  you  need,  need  me  to  be  with  you
I  will  follow where  you  lead
If  you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and oh so cold
All you gotta do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Where you  lead,  I will  follow
Anywhere you tell me to
If  you  need,  need me  to  be  with  you
I will follow where you lead
I've  always  wanted  a  real  home
With  flowers  on  the  windowsill
But  if  you  want  to  live  in  New  York  City
Honey,  you  know  I  will,
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
I  never thought I could get satisfaction
From just  one  man
If anyone can keep me  happy
Oh, you're the  one  who  can
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm  gonna  follow  where  you  lead me
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause  darling, to  me  that's  what  you're  worth
Where you lead I will  follow
Anywhere...
Anywhere you tell me to
If  you  need, need me to be with  you
I will follow, oh, where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where  you  lead  me
I'm gonna follow  where  you lead  me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me ...
