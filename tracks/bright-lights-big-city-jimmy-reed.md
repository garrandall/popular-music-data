Bright light, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Oh, bright light, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Well I tried to tell the woman
But she don't believe a word I said

Goodbye, pretty baby
Gonna need my help someday
Whoa, it's all right, pretty baby
Gonna need my help someday
Ya' gonna wish that you had listened
To some of those things I said

Go ahead, pretty baby
A-honey, knock yourself out
Oh go ahead, pretty baby
Honey, knock yourself out
Cause I still love ya baby
Cause you don't know what it's all about

Bright light, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Oh, bright light, big city
Gone to my baby's head
I tried to tell the woman
But she don't believe a thing I said

Bright light, big city
Bright light, big city
Oh, bright light, big city
Gone to my baby's head
I tried to tell the woman
But she don't believe a word I said
And I tried to tell the woman
Don't believe a word I said
I tried to tell the woman
She don't believe a word I said
