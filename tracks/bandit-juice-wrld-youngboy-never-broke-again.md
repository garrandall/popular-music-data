It's funny, the shit I put on this song ain't gonna sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin'
Oh
Yeah
I just want bad bitches
Baddest, them bitches is the baddest
Uh-uh, when I take the Molly I'm a savage
Uh, I say

I don't need no Molly to be savage
Uh, when I'm on that Molly I feel savage
She the definition of a bad bitch (Stole her)
I'm the definition of a bandit
I don't need no Molly to be savage
Aye but when I'm on that Molly I feel savage
Aye my girl the definition of a bad bitch, stole her heart
I'm the definition of a bandit

Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas jiggas jiggass
Tommy and the fuckin' Tommy Hilfiger (figer figer)
That Tommy hit a nigga Tommy Hilfiger fuck nigga
I'm nice when I'm high off the pills I'ma fuck with her
I don't smoke skunk but tonight I'm getting stuck nigga
Pour the codeine up and put some Molly in the cup with it
I know she a freak uh huh, she gon' fuck with it
She my Velcro uh huh, guess I'm stuck with her
I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and a eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
No TEC, no Beretta FN on me, am I understood? (Yeah)

I don't need no Molly to be savage
When I'm on that Molly I feel savage
She the definition of a bad bitch (Stole her)
I'm the definition of a bandit
Aye, I don't need no Molly to be savage
Aye, but when I'm on that Molly I feel savage
Aye, my girl the definition of a bad bitch, stole her heart
I'm the definition of a bandit


My brother point her out and she a bad bitch I'm on her
Must ain't heard that I'm a savage once I get a bitch I own her
I see she got swag I got cash so I want her
See this .45 in my pants put on your ass put you on one
Shorty, she a rider with that glizzy on her (With that glizzy on her)
And shorty, I'ma die there with no semi on me (No semi on me)
If we got a problem we get rid of homie (cash)
Put twenty thousand in your pocket we gon' get the money

I'm the definition of a bandit
Took your heart from out his hands and still ain't saying shit
Some new killers in my circle you done ran with
Like this dirty .38, this bitch'll damage
Popping wheelies 4KTREY caught when you land with it (pop, pop, pop)
I let you drive inside my bros where they been laying with it (skrt)
I work this bitch I open up a can with it
Like fuck the stove I make it jump without my hand in it


I don't need no Molly to be savage
When I'm on that Molly I feel savage
She the definition of a bad bitch (Stole her)
I'm the definition of a bandit
Aye, I don't need no Molly to be savage
Aye, but when I'm on that Molly I feel savage
Aye, my girl the definition of a bad bitch, stole her heart
I'm the definition of a bandit
