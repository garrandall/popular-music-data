I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking slurpees we mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (whoa oh oh oh)
I told her I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any girl to be getting in my way
But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh)
I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
I'll never say that I'm sorry

'Cause I want an american girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all american girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key right in your ignition (Oh-way-oh)

I wanna see all the stars and everything in between
I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
'Cause It's a free country so baby we can do anything (Whoa)
I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
I'll never say that I'm sorry

'Cause I want an american girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all american girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key right in your ignition (Oh-way-oh)

You know we're gonna shine so bright
(We're gonna shine so bright...)
Oh baby gonna go all night

'Cause I want an american girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all american girl (Whoa)
I want an American girl
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key right in your ignition (Oh-way-oh)

'Cause I want an american girl
