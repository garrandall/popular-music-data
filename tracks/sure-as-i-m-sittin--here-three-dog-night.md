Ya git up
Ya git down
Ya git lost
And then ya get found

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Ya git a laugh
Ya git a cry
Get 'em all before you die

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

All the ladies
(Fine ladies)
Hypnotize you
And all your friends
Well, they just patronize you

Don't gotta look for God
He's just sittin' here
And I think He's got a plan
But it's not too clear

You git the truth
Ya git a lie
'nough to make a grown man cry

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

You git the light
You git the dark
Fall in love
It breaks your heart

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Now you might think
It's confusin'
With all you got
Well, look what all you're losin'

But it's just life
And it just goes on
So quit with your complainin'
Soon enough you will be gone

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
