This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt like hell
This is gonna damn near kill me, sometimes the truth ain't easy
I know that you're scared of telling me something
I don't wanna hear, but baby believe that
I'm not leaving, you couldn't give me one good reason

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run

Let's lay it on the line, I don't care if it takes all night cuz
This is gonna makes us stronger, it's gonna make forever longer
I know it'd be easier walking away but what we got is real
And I wanna save us, baby we can do it, Baby we'll get through it cause

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough, it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run
Baby love don't run

So come over here and lay down in my arms
Baby tell me everything that's on your heart, cause

I won't run, and I won't hide
I won't turn away, I just wanna make things right
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run
Baby Love don't run
