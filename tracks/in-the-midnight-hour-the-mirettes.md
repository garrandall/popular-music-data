I'm gonna wait
'Til that midnight hour,
When when my love
Comes tumblin' down.

I'm gonna wait
'Til that midnight hour,
When there's no
One else around.

Gonna kiss you,
? You and hold you,
Do all things I told ya,
In that midnight hour.
(In the midnight hour)
Oh yes, oh yes I will.
(In the midnight hour)

I'm gonna wait
'Til the stars come out.
And see that twinkle
In your eye.

I'm gonna wait
'Til that midnight hour,
When my love
Begins to shine.

You're the only boy I know,
That really loves me so,
In that midnight hour.
(In that midnight hour)
Oh, baby,
In that midnight hour.
(In the midnight hour)



I just can't wait,
I say I just can't wait,
To hold you close to me, baby.
To have you close to me, honey.
To feel your touch.
You know you're much too much.

Oh, come on now, boy,
Hear my heart rejoice (?)

I say I just can't wait.
(In the midnight hour)
No I just can't wait.
(In the midnight hour)
I just can't wait!
(In the midnight hour)
Oh no! I just can't wait.
(In the midnight hour)
Oh oh oh!
In the midnight hour!

I'm gonna wait
'Til that midnight hour,
When when my love,
It comes tumblin' down.

I'm gonna wait
'Til that midnight hour,
When there's no
One else around.

Nobody but you and I,
Oh yeah,
(In the midnight hour)
No one, nobody else,
(In the midnight hour)
Oh baby, in that midnight hour.
(In the midnight hour)
Oh yeah, can you dig it, baby?
(Dig it dig it)
Oh yeah, I can dig it, baby.
(Dig it dig it)
In the midnight hour.
(In the midnight hour)
Oh yes, in that midnight hour.
(In the midnight hour)
