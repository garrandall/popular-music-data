When you drag in the sunrise
All over your feet
I never ask you where youve been
I always let you sleep late
And bring you breakfast baby in bed
Lord what a woman in love won't do.

At times I've caught you lying
With your bare face hanging out
But I just couldnt follow through
I'd just be proving
That you're being untrue
Lord what a woman in love won't do.

What makes me keep on
Puttin up with this?
What keeps me kneeling
Underneath my masters kiss?
Could it be that I'm leaving
Or being untrue too, like you?
Lord what a woman in love won't do
Whoo oo oo oohoo
In love won't do
Whoo oo oo oohoo
In love won't do
