Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I'll see you in the morning
No, of course, he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh you'll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny - like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waiting outside

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you'll stay up late just waiting for me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I've got eight days off coming up
And I can only come home for four

Yeah I just met his family
They're just like you and mom
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he'd never hurt me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you, "You were the first man that really loved me."

And before they open up the doors
I say, "I've never seen you cry before."
You say, "You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl"

You're looking at me, we're walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me

Oh, that really loved me, oh
You really love me
