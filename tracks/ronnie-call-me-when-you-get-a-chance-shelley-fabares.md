Ronnie, I know that you're mad at me
So, I'm writing this note to ask you please

Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
There's something I just have to say
I wasn't flirting with Jim
When you saw me with him
I could never hurt you that way

So, Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
And give me a chance to explain
You saw me talking to Joe
But I want you to know
Every other word was your name (Ronnie)

You saw me with some of your buddies
And that was careless of me (Sha la la)
Everything went wrong (Sha la la)
When you came along (Sha la la)
And saw what you weren't supposed to see

So, Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
So you can get everything right
I only met with the guys
Just to plan a surprise
For your birthday, Saturday night

(Ronnie, call me when you get a chance)
(Ronnie)

You saw me with some of your buddies
And that was careless of me (Sha la la)
Everything went wrong (Sha la la)
When you came along (Sha la la)
And saw what you weren't supposed to see

So, Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
So you can get everything right
I only met with the guys
Just to plan a surprise
For your birthday, Saturday night

(Ronnie, call me when you get a chance)
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
(Ronnie, call me when you get a chance)
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
(Ronnie, call me when you get a chance)
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
