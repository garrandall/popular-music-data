Welcome to the world, welcome to the world


You got your popstar, I'll be your rockstar
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You'll get your fifteen, and then they take the spot


(Let's go, let's go) And then you're ready to go
(Let's go, let's go) Cause it's the end of the show
(Let's go, let's go) So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go


All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world


She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent, and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination

Life's a tour, I'm so sure
The ex will come before you exit girl
No more games, I confess
Far from lane, I'm just so fresh
Who be me? It's the big boss
You get on the block, Mr Rudolf
2 stars, hold your applause
Hold it down to y'all's own guitars
Half my life I sacrificed
But I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up
Every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the big cuts
Only be the best sport, get your mix up
Took my time, she's loving me such
When she closes her eyes it's what she thinks of
Baous




Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
