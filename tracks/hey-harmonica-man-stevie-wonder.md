Hey Harmonica Man,
Whatcha calling my name?
Tell us if you can,
It's my one big thing.
Does it really true?
Whatcha want to know?
What your thing can do,
Did ya every hear me blow?
Can you play that thing?
I can play that thing?
Make it dance and sing?
Make you dance and sing
Do it if you can can can Harmonica man.
Aw I'm gonna blow now

Now we've been searching for a long long time
To find a way to leave our trouble behind
We been down under and we sure been blue
Come on and play it like we know you can do

Hey Harmonica Man
Whatcha calling me for?
You wanna take the stand?
You wanna dance some more?
We wanna dance some more
Everythings alright.
Down on the sandy shore
I can play all night!
Do the Monkey Watusi
Do the Monkey Watusi.
While you play lil bluesy
I'm playing it bluesy
Do it if you can can can Harmonica Man
Papa gonna wail now

Hey Harmonica Man
Whatcha calling me for?
Wanna take the stand?
Gonna dance the floor.
We wanna dance some more.
Everythings alright.
Down on the sandy shore
I can play all night!
Do the Monkey Watusi,
Do the Monkey Watusi.
Like little bluesy
I gonna play real bluesy
Do it if you can can can, Harmonica Man.
Awww everybodys gonna wail now
