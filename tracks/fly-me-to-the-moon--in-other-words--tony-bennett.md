Poets often use many words
To say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem sing
With music and words I've been playing
For you I've written a song
To make sure you know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Darlin kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you..
