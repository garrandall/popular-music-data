I be on it all night, man, I be on it (day day day)
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the

Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)

Time and time again, I gotta turn back 'round and tell these hoes
That I'm the H-N-I-C, bitch, that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit that have you on it, I don't want no more
At this time, I'll need all my freak hoes to get down on the floor
If you came to rep your set, break that bitch, I let them know
If it's jail I get for stomping haters to sleep, fuck it, I go
Freak, I'll be off in your sheets, straight geeked, swervin' down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23's on the feet
Collection while he do brown, back in town to do re-bag
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A
Hooked up, clicked up with some people that don't play
On that Kryptonite, stay
So high we might fly away

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I, I, I, I, I, be on it all night, man, I be on it (day day day)
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the

Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)

Kryptonite, on that Kryptonite
I'm on that Kryptonite
On that Kryptonite

Time and time again I gotta tell these bitches and these hoes
I'm from College Park, where we move that weed and we sling that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Pull the dro' and I'm on probation
My blunts, I don't be lacing

I'm on that Kryptonite
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run, tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell them 'bout the plaques on the walls
Tell them how you licked my balls
Tell them how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

Chevy riders, slingin' powders; Simpson Road, Dixie Hills
Diamonds pressed against that wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind time, rap game, remember bitches, Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rollin' o's, and we all be on that Kryp

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I, I, I, I, I, be on it all night, man, I be on it (day day day)
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the

Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)

Kryptonite, on that Kryptonite
I'm on that Kryptonite
On that Kryptonite

Time and time again, I gotta turn back 'round and tell C-Bone
Grab that kurl on out my book bag, I smell 'dro all on you, homes
Suppose the po-po get whiff of the spliff that you smoke, them folk gonna trip
Probably will cause the canines, move it the side of the road, let's take a sniff
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is GBK CD, Tackleberry
So we may be on our merry way
'Cause you just ain't gonna find no yah
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sippin' syrupy
They dirty, he can't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

Chevy riders, slingin' powders; Simpson Road, Dixie Hills
Diamonds pressed against that wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind time, rap game, remember bitches, Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rollin' o's, and we all be on that Kryp

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I, I, I, I, I, be on it all night, man, I be on it (day day day)
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the

Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)

Kryptonite, (I'm on it) on that Kryptonite (I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it)
On that Kryptonite

I, I, I, I, I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite

I, I, I, I, I, be on it all night, man, I be on it (day day day)
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the

Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)
Ay (I'm on it)

Kryptonite, on that Kryptonite
I'm on that Kryptonite
On that Kryptonite
