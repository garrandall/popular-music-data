Every time I look into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money, just can't buy
One look, from you, I drift, away
I pray, that you, are here, to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Everytime I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you, tells me your my man
I live, (I live) my life, (my life) to be, (to be) with you (with you)
No one, (no one) can do, (can do) the things, (the things) you do (you do)

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything at all... Babe

Whoa yeah babe

I'm glad, (I'm glad) to give, (to give) my love, (my love) to you (to you)
I know, (I know) you feel, (you feel) the way, (the way) I do (I do)

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Anything, anything you want baby
Anything you need
Anything at all
Anything at all
Baby, you got it
