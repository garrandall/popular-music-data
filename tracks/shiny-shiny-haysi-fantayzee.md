Good times come to me now
Good times come to me now
I ain't lying 'cause there ain't no time
No city
It's a pity 'cause I dress divine
City smokes, people choke
Big meanie he's a genie and we ain't got a hope
No chance, no chance
Well
I feel fine
No, it ain't no crime
I was dreamin' of a demon and I ate a dime
The dime floats
The colonel boasts
Send 'em up the hill boys, this ain't no joke

No chance, no chance, no chance, no chance
Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny sha-na-na-na
Shiny shiny bad times behind me

Shiny shiny bad times behind me

Your sure look fine your shoes they shine
I taste your face your love is mine

Mercury Dan with a spiky hand
I'm a hot retard
Marquis de Sade
No chance, no chance, no chance, no chance
Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Saw a cop on the line
Machine gun shine
I was dreaming not believing that I was alive
My mind broke
The cop he choked
Get out of here, boy, or I'll use the colt

No chance, no chance
You sure look fine your shoes they shine
No heat can compete with this blue-eyed liar
The child spoke, we ain't got a hope

Press the button
Press the button, it's all remote
No chance, no chance, no chance, no chance
Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me

Shiny shiny, bad times behind me
