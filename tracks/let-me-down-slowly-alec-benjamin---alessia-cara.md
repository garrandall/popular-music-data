This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly


I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly


And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
