Oohhh, hoo, hey hey

Time waits for no one
And nobody gets away
Nobody gets away
There's no exception
We all got our dues to pay
I got my dues to pay

We make it up baby
But we will?
If we don't hurry up
We're gonna lose our love

Because time waits for no one
And we're running out of time
Time waits for no one
Waits for no one
Waits for no one
Waits for no one

Some people blow it
They wake up when it's too late
Wake up when it's too late
Don't say tomorrow
The clock on the wall won't wait
My clock on the wall won't wait

It won't slow down
It just keeps moving away
While you talk about the future
It's becoming the past

Time waits for no one, no one
And we're running out of time
Time waits for no one
Waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Waits for no one

You better take me now
And love me right on the spot
We gotta make the most
Of every minute we got

Time waits for no one, no one
And we're runnin' out of time
Get it on, get along, get it on
Get it on, get along, get it on
Time, time, time, time

Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one
Time waits for no one

We're running out of time
