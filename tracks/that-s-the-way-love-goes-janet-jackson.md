Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
That's the way love goes
(That's the way love, that's the way love)
(That's the way love goes)
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire (that's the way)
My love is blind can't you see my desire? (that's the way)
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire (that's the way)
My love is blind can't you see my desire?
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
(That's the way, that's the way, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
My love is blind can't you see my desire?
(That's the way, that's the way, that's the way love goes)


Come with me, don't you worry
I'm gonna make you crazy
I'll give you the time of your life
I'm gonna take you places
You've never been before and
You'll be so happy that you came
Oh, I'm gonna take you there, oh


That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
(That's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes (that's the way)
That's the way love goes
(That's the way, that's the way love goes)


Don't mind if I light candles
I like to watch us play and
Baby, I've got on what you like
Come closer, baby, closer
Reach out and feel my body
I'm gonna give you all my love
Oh, sugar don't you hurry
You've got me here all night
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
(That's the way, that's the way)
Oh, baby, don't stop, don't stop
Go deeper, baby, deeper
You feel so good I'm gonna cry
Oh, I'm gonna take your there


That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
Don't you know it goes? That's the way


Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?


That's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way, that's the way)
That's the way love goes, it goes, it goes
(That's the way, that's the way)
That's the way love goes


That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way love goes)
That's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love
That's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love
That's the way love goes
