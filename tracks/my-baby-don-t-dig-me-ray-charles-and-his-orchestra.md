Sometimes I stop and wonder
How can this thing go on
For when I'm with my baby
She always make me feel alone

No, my woman don't dig me, no, no
Boys, I know I'm gonna
Know the reason why

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)

Well, we're as far from each other
As the Earth is from the sky

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)

Well, I put my arms around her
She'll flinch and move away
And that's not just one time
You know that's each and every day

I tell you, my woman
She don't dig me now
No, no, no, no, now, now
Boys, I know the reason why

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)

Well, we're far from each other
Hey, yeah, as the Earth
Is from the sky

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)

We don't have enough in common
To act like lovers should
I think that's the reason
Our love affair's no good

You know my woman don't dig me
No, no, no, no
Now people I tell you
I know the reason why

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)

Well, we're far from each other
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
As the Earth is from the sky

(No, no, my baby don't dig me)
(No, no, she just don't dig me)...
