Alone again, I'm waiting for your love
To come into my life
I'll take you in and give you all I have
Together we'll make it last

I've been thinking about you again
I'll be your lover and your best friend
Every night I hope and pray
That maybe you'll come my way

We could be falling together in love
You are the only one I'm dreaming of

I've been thinking about you
And I don't want to live without you (live without you)
You and I, we can be just fine
But I want your love to be all mine

I've been thinking about you
And I don't want to live without you
You and I, we can be just right
But I need your love tonight, uh uh yeah

Here I am, still waiting for your love
So come into my life
Take me in and never let me go
Baby, just hold me close

I've been thinking about you again
I know you know so I won't pretend
Every night I hope and pray
This time you'll come my way

We could be fallin' together in love
You are the only one I'm dreaming of

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you

We could be fallin' together in love
You are the one that I'm dreaming of

I've been thinking about you
And I don't want to live without you (live without you)
You and I, we can be just fine
But I want your love to be all mine

I've been thinking about you
And I don't want to live without you
You and I, we can be just right
But I need your love tonight

I've been thinking about you (thinking about you)
And I don't want to live without you (live without you)
You and I, we can be just fine
But I want your love to be all mine

I've been thinking about you
And I don't want to live without you (live without you)
You and I, we can be just right
But I need your love tonight
