We were half a mile high on the ferris wheel
At our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until
She told me way up there
That's when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground
The day that she left tulsa

Chorus
In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin down rain
With the caution lights flashin in the passin lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin down the drain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin' down rain

No she wasn't showin yet
But she'd be by Christmas time
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine
She never came out and told me that I was wrong
But all of a sudden the light came on
The day that she left tulsa


I guess she thought the truth would end up drivin me away
But she was wrong but I never had the chance to say
The day that she left tulsa

In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin down rain (2 X's)


In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin down rain (2x's)
