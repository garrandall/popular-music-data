Enough of the break up
Girl, let's deal with the make up
Alimony mean all the money
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man (The only man in you life)
Didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can (Mmm)

But for all the love I gave ya
It's never enough (Not enough)
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough (So)
So come on, come on, come on, come on, and

So what, you have me under pressure
Despite the fact say in life you give me pleasure
I'm the only man and I possess the keys to you treasure
So give the contender on the trail
Captivate your mind, I'll make your heart grow fonder
Still you're trying to find out whose covers that I'm under
So you start to wonder, heart beat like thunder
So I blow my cover
'Cause I'm the great pretender, girl, surrender, yeah

 Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
 Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(Hey, darling, give it up, give it up, give it up)
 Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good

You play detective boo, want a new suit
Going through my pockets, searchin' for clues
Trying to follow me, you and your desperate crew
The end of this relationship was long over due
Now what you did was cute, girl, you spent the loot
Easy on the tears, oops, man, you soil my suit
Do yourself a favor and find a new recruit
And don't take it personal because you got the boot

You're out on the streets (Absolutely)
And you know deep down in you heart that that ain't right (Come on, come on)
And, oh, you never, never hear me when I cry at night
I tell myself, that I can stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms (Yeah) I sing it again
So come on, come on, come on, come on (So what?) and

 Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
 Break another little bit of my heart now, honey (I don't think you know)
 Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good

I can make you , you can make me
Anyway you want it, baby, we can do it right
Jump out a the frying pan and straight down in a the fire
I'm Mr. Gigolo, your most notorious liar
Ex-amount of loving you get what me did require
Your personal attendant, well, my love is not for hire
Girl, search yourself, 'cause I'm you heart's desire
25 girls in a my life, don't want a wife, I need a lover, yeah

 Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
 Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(I got your heart, I got your heart, girl)
 (Shoop) Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good


Rock, baby
