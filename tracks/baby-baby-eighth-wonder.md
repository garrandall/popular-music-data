She hit that pole in my basement, she rollin', she wasted
She face bout an eighth of that space shit and went ape shit
Don't pace it, don't chase it
That's straight lick - it burn slow
She role play my teacher and I can't wait to learn nigga
I role play big turn up, Obey, that's G shit
We smoking Js of that juicy fruit, that Juicy J, that 3-6
White T's, first class flights and Nike kicks, believe this
Waves on, tsunami, she likely get seasick
I red tail that fly boy, Michael Phelp in the cloud, boy
In the sea of that loud boy, altitude is all altoids
Fresh bitch like breath mints
Whilin up in the section
The monkey's roll and that kush to go
Bottles up in this section


Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down


She dolled up, I'm soda
Red cup that I hold up
Break the milk but wait, hold up
Fuck I do with my roll up
I want this shit and I want you too
I know this shit sound cynical
But can I skip the skit and get into you?
Baby can you strip and get in the pool?
Life is so yummy when your problems taste like honey
Every day so sunny when I'm pound cakin this money
2 hands on full grip, take this shit to the bank
She said boy you takin my breath away
Girl get a oxygen tank
Damn, caught you fallin but my feet were out of bounds
Sooner or later you gon reach some solid ground
Who the fuck said chilvery dead?
Girl, why you quit givin me head?
Makin me call Lewinski
You fuckin up like Hilary did


Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down

Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down
Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down


I know that I belongs to you
I wonder if I'll ever be found
Caught between the life and the lights and uh
Oh maybe we can figure this out
I figure it's ahead of where the crown I found
The hardest form of troublesome
'Cause we always come undone, yea we always
Yea we always
