Nasty, you're nasty
Oh, that was nasty

Strange things are
Running through your mind
I look at you and now you're kind

Those things are
Written all over your face
You're a disgrace, let's face it
You're nasty

Nasty, you're nasty
Oh, that was nasty

You stop and watch them as they dance
You say you're looking for romance
You know wanna bump and grind
Nasty thoughts on your mind
You're nasty
