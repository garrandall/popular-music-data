The summer flowers are waiting
The birds are made for mating
A bee was pollinating
And I was calculating
Like a silly fool
Wondering what to do
Wondering what to do

I played the part of a queen
Sitting up on a throne
I had lots of guys
But no one I wanted to call my own
Deep down inside
I felt the same as you
Wondering to wondering to

Wondering if it happens
Like it happens to millions before
I took one look at your face
I wanted to see it some more
And I tried playing it cool
Like a silly fool
Wondering what to do

Baby I knew that
I couldn't live without you
I ran right home
And I wrote a song all about you
Nothing like this
Had ever happened to me before
I was afraid but I knew
I had to see you once more
Yeah, yeah

My minutes turn to hours
My hours turn into days
My road ahead got straighter
I exited my maze

And I did something new
I started living for you
I started living for you
