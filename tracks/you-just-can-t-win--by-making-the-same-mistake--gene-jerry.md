Over and over again


Oh, when am I gonna realize
Can’t bet my heart every time it cries
The things you never expect
That cause so much regret
I could have been much further today
If I had learned from my mistake
Like a stubborn child
I wouldn’t use my head
Remember what the old folks said


Oh, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
Oh, Lord, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
(I need to tell you)
Over and over again
(Hallelujah)
Over and over again


When I think I’m over the hill
Something happens to kill the will
The things that I enjoy
Seems always be destroyed
Jerry, I bit off more than I can chew
Depending on someone to see me through
Mama said the blind can’t lead the blind
Son, always keep this in mind


Oh, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
Oh, Lord, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
(Oh, no)
Over and over again
(Hallelujah)
Over and over again
(Well, well, well)


If a boxer telegraphs his punch
Or a fly when he catches lunch
The element of surprise
Make a whole lot of people realize
Sometimes you find that you’re in a pinch
Some games are won by the inch
The motto of the living man is
Don’t make that same mistake


Oh, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
Say it again, you just can’t win
By making that same mistake
(Hey, Lord)
Over and over again
(Hallelujah)
Over and over again
(Take it home)


You just can’t win
By making that same mistake
You just can’t win
By making that same mistake
You just can’t win
By making that same mistake
You just can’t win
By making that same mistake
