Baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night
Baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night
It's gonna be one on one
Let everybody know
We gonna be havin' fun
Gettin' down all night I know
Everybody's dancin'
Dancin' to the music
Lookin' for some action
Tryin' to find a new thing
But I know what's happenin', baby
I've been lookin' for you, yeah
I wanna give you somethin'
That you just can't lose
Hey, baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night
Baby, we're gonna be thumpin'
It's a disco night
We gonna be all night long
Let everybody know
It's gonna be one on one
Gettin' down at the disco
Oh, baby
Rock on, girl
Oh, baby
Rock on, baby
Oh, baby, the place is rockin'
