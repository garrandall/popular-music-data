I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
When I cry, you don't laugh
Because you know me


I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
Because you gave me the love
Love that I never had
Yes, you gave me the love
Love that I never had


You and I don't pretend
We make love
I can't feel any more
Than I'm singing, yeah




Come so far when you think
Of last fall
You can't buy what we made
You and I, oh




You gave me the love
Love that I never had
I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
