Yeah, baby
Ayy


I want you to be mine again, baby, ayy
I know my lifestyle is driving you crazy, ayy
I cannot see myself without you
We call them fans, though, girl, you know how we do
I go out of my way to please you
I go out of my way to see you
And I want you to be mine again, baby, ayy
I know my lifestyle is driving you crazy, ayy
But I cannot see myself without you
We call them fans, though, girl, you know how we do
I go out of my way to please you

I ain't playing no games, I need you


Baby, can you understand I'm a young nigga living?
Coming from the trap, all a nigga know is get it
I ain't chasing no pussy, girl, I'm talkin' 'bout the digits
Big bank rolls in my pockets, all fifties
Turned a little check, then I showed you I could triple it
Baby, it's Zoovier, I only want you
I don't give a fuck who cares, tats on my face
She don’t give a fuck who stares, looking too good
Get you fucked on sight
I'm tryna finish this who I started with
I'm tryna spend it all who I got it with, ayy
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando, ayy
We be counting up, watch how far them bands go, ayy
Hop out my Bimmer, she jump out the Lambo, ayy
Roll them bands up, smooth how the wind go, ayy
Dumping wood guts all out the window, ayy
Married to the money, I ain't never lettin' go, ayy
Baby, it's ZooWap from the bando, ayy
Dumping wood guts all out the window, ayy
Married to the money, I ain't never let go, ayy
Baby, it's ZooWap from the fucking bando

I hope you know I need you, ayy, yeah, baby

And all the bands down to going up, girl, you know we ran through it
