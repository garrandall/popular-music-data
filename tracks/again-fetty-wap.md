I want you to be mine again baby
I know my lifestyle is driving you crazy
I cannot see myself without you
We call them fans though, girl you know how we do
I go out of my way to please you
I go out of my way to see you
And I want you to be mine again baby
I know my lifestyle is driving you crazy
But, I cannot see myself without you
We call them fans though, girl you know how we do
I go out of my way to please you
I go out of the way to see you
I ainât playing no games, I need you

Baby, can you understand Iâm a young nigga living
Coming from the trap, all a nigga know is get it
I ainât chasing no pussy, girl Iâm talking âbout the digits
Big bank rolls in my pockets, all fifties
Turned a little check, then, I showed you I could triple it
Baby, itâs Zoovier, only want you
I donât give a fuck who cares, tats on my face
She donât give a fuck who stares, looking too good
Get you fucked on sight
Iâm tryna finish this who I started with
Iâm tryna spend it all who I got it with
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be counting up, watch how far them bands go
Hop out my beamer, she jump out the Lambo
Roll them bands up, smooth how the wind go
Dumping wood guts allout the window
Married to the money, I ainât never let go
Baby, itâs Zoowap from the bando
Dumping wood guts allout the window
Married to the money, I ainât never let go
Baby, itâs ZooWap from the fucking bando



I hope you know I need you, ay, yeaaah baby
I get up on my knees too, ay, yeaaah baby
Do anything to please you, ay, yeaaah baby
Top down when we breeze through, ay, yeaaah baby
Know they call me Zoovier
We living like a movie
And all the bands down to going up, girl, you know we ran through it
I need you baby, I ainât afraid admit it
Girl, I need you baby, girl tell me if you with it
Yeaah baby, all the bands Iâma spend it
Big ZooWap to the finish
When I come through, they screaming out
Zoovier, baby scream it loud



And I want you to be mine again baby
I know my lifestyle is driving you crazy
But, I cannot see myself without you
We call them fans though, girl you know how we do
I go out of my way to please you
I go out of the way to see you
I ainât playing no games, I need you
