Hey there, mister, build a fence around your sister
It's the boys' night out
Hey there, buster, it's the Injuns after Custer
It's the boys' night out

They're out to do the town and before they're through
It's bound to be likened to
The night they lost the Titanic and the Wall Street panic

What they're seekin' is a little cheek-to-cheekin'
It's the boys' night out
And that moon's about as big as a honeydew
Well, it's the boys' night out and they're so romantic
But I'll give you a clue
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after, too

Boys' night out


It's the boys' night out and they're so romantic
But I'll give you a clue
What the boys are out after
 (the boys are out after)
The girls are out after
 (the girls are out after)
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after, too
