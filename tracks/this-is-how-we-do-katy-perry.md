This is how we do
This is how we do (Oh-oh)


Sipping on Rosé
Silver Lake sun coming up all lazy (This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy (Oh-oh)
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy (This is how we do)
Chanel this, Chanel that
Hell yeah, all my girls vintage Chanel, baby


It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal


This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do


Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati (This is how we...)
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties (Oh-oh)
Now we talkin’ astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y (This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke (Oh-oh)


It's no big deal
It's no big deal (Uh-uh)
It's no big deal
This is no big deal


This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do


Yo, this one goes out to the ladies
At breakfast, in last night's dress
(It’s how we do, straight stunting like that)
Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids
That still have their cars at the club valet
And it's Tuesday
(It’s how we do, straight stunting like that)
Yo, shoutout to all you kids
Buying bottle service with your rent money!
Respect!


This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do


(This is how we do)
This goes out to all you people
Going to bed with a 10, and waking up with a 2
(This is how we do)
Ha, not me!


This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
What? Wait
No no no no, bring the beat back
That's right
This is how we do
Uh-oh
This is how we do
Uh-oh
