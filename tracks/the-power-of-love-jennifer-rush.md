The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look into your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender, a love that I could not forsake


Cause I am your lady and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you


Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side


Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love


The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away


Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
Oh, the power of love
The power of love

Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love
