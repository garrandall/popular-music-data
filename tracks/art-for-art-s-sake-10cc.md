Gimme your body
Gimme your mind
Open your heart
Pull down the blind 

Gimme your love gimme it all
Gimme in the kitchen gimme in the hall 

Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for Arts sake
Money for Gods sake 

Gimme the readys
Gimme the cash
Gimme a bullet
Gimme a smash
Gimme a silver gimme a gold
Make it a million for when I get old 

Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for Arts sake
Money for Gods sake 

Money talks so listen to it
Money talks to me
Anyone can understand it
Money can't be beat Oh no 

When you get down, down to the root
Don't give a damn don't give a hoot
Still gotta keep makin the loot
Chauffeur driven 

Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin' make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven 

Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays 

Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake 

Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
