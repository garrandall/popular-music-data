Trying hard to fight these tears
I'm crazy worried
Messing with my head this fear
I'm so sorry
You know you gotta get it out
I can't take it
That's what being friends' about


I, I wanna cry
I can't deny
Tonight I wanna up and hide
And get inside
It isn't right
I gotta live in my life
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it


Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate
Push until you can't and then demand more
Determinate, d-determinate
You and me together, we can make it better
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate

(Verse 2)
Hate to feel this way
And waste a day
I gotta get myself on stage
I shouldn't wait
Or be afraid
The chips will fall where they may
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it


Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate
Push until you can't and then demand more
Determinate, d-determinate
You and me together, we can make it better
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate


Okay, it's Wen and I'm heaven-sent, music like a veteran
Renegade, lemonade, use it in my medicine
Go ahead and try to name a band we ain't better than
Reason why the whole world's picking us instead of them
People need a breather 'cause they're feeling that adrenaline
Stop! Now hurry up and let us in
Knock! 'Cause we're coming to your house and
People keep on smiling like there lemons in their mouths
I'm the real deal, you know how I feel
Why they're in it for a bill, I'm just in it for the thrill
Get down now I ain't playin' around
Put your feet up on the ground and just make that sound like


Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate
Push until you can't and then demand more
Determinate, d-determinate
You and me together, we can make it better
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate


Come on and, come on and
Come on and get it going
Come on and, come on and
Come on and get it going
On the dance floor
On the dance floor
D-d-dance floor
Determinate
