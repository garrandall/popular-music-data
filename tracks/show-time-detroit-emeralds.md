Show time
Everybody feeling good
Let's go

Show time, baby
Ow, uh
Everybody's having fun, woo
Show time, baby
Ooh, ooh
Everybody, get some

Lookie here, ha

The clock on the wall
Says it loud and clear
If you're looking for excitement
Baby, you can find it here

It makes you feel good all over
I'm feeling good all over

It doesn't matter where you came from
Or whether you're young or old
Everybody, let your hair down
And let the music thrill your soul
Now everybody

Show time, baby
Ow, uh
Everybody's having fun, woo
Show time, baby
Ooh, ooh
Everybody, get some

It makes you feel good all over
I'm feeling good all over

Here comes the good old music
To fill you with delight, shucks
When the music hits your soul
Say, it's all right

Tell each and everybody
For miles and miles around
Shucks, now get yourself a partner
We gonna tear the whole house down
Now everybody

Show time, baby
Ow, uh
Everybody's having fun, woo
Show time, baby
Ooh, ooh
Everybody, get some

It makes you feel good all over
I'm feeling good all over

James Brown says
Now Wilson Pickett says
Otis Redding says
Now everybody say

Ow, shucks
T's show time, baby
Come on, baby
Everybody's having fun, shucks
I said it's show time
Everybody's getting some

I said it's show time, baby
Everybody's having fun
