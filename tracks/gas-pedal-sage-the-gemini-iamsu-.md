H-h-h-holy shhh...


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo' ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 


I put my foot down, yeah that's the way it is
Lookin' good now, whatcha see is whatcha get
Neighborhoods hella jealous when they see the wheels
Pull up in the gun metal 'Rari with a fresh fit
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Tryna keep up like ad-de-ral
I ain't even stressin' no a-at all
So presidential, I'm fe-de-ral
Oh

I'm tryna get there, so when I get there
I'm a make sure you won't forget babe
So hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw them ridin' on your ass, and yeah I'm ready babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah, you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route
Pedal to the floor, watch me peel out


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo' ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 


No neutrons deactivator
It's going up no explainin' the escalator
I'm tryna keep this here alive, the bays respirator
Let 'em see me shine, they call me one hit wonder now I'm at 3 times
I'm seein' big things now they want me blind
I made your girl fall you ain't even check archives
Kelly Boy, HBK, I make songs like it's my last name, I must be Trey
Ballin' like Dave Chapelle, playin' prince tell 'em shoot the J

More money for the bay, and no we ain't gon' pass the ball
Haters die slow and get your casket tossed
Audi S7 sport pass 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal


I'm tryna get there, so when I get there
I'm a make sure you won't forget babe
So hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw them ridin' on your ass, yeah I'm ready babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah, you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route
Pedal to the floor, watch me peel out


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo' ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 


I'm the bomb you can't disarm me
I need multiple cuts like a swiss army
And I hope that she ain't lookin' for no prince charming
Charm your ass in the cab on the next morning

Tell the driver, gas pedal
Yo Suzy, I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was a underachiever
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your, heart out, used to take the bart out
To the city from my mom's house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain, I think that the sun out
When you walk in the building the bitches run out
I should be already platinum before it comes out
We should do it major look in the eyes of my haters they say


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo' ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 


I'm tryna get there, so when I get there
I'm a make sure you won't forget babe
So hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw them ridin' on your ass, yeah I'm ready babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah, you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route
Pedal to the floor, watch me peel out


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo' ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up,
Gas pedal 
Now speed up,
Gas pedal
