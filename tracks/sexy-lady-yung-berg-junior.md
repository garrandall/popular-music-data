But I got to move on (yeah)
Hey sexy lady.

Oh, and damn right baby girl's a diva,
But everytime she out wit me she be blowin' reefa.
In the coupe looking better than the Mona Lisa.
Tunin' in to my songs thinkin' bout features.
She know her lil' nigga spit ether
And them grown dudes really don't know how to treat her.
So she rock wit me and I roll wit her
Cause I'm a D-boy and she's a go-getta.

Uh, this new girl that I'm poofin' on,
Got a young boy thinkin' bout movin on.
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and the shoes on.
Wanna take her to the Telly, bust a move dogg.
See a nigga need more than one,
I parked the Rolls outside like Reverend Run.
And rolled up the blunt, yeah, full of bubble gum.
Yung Bosses, it's our year, we got another one.

Hey sexy lady,
It was nice to know you (it was nice to know ya)
But I gotta move on (yeah)
Hey sexy lady,
It was nice to know you (it was nice to know ya)
But I got to move on (yeah)
Hey sexy lady.

Yeah, and damn right baby girl the shit.
She love it when I throw it deep like Micheal Vick.
I love it cause she know them youngins don't write a lick.
She know the kid hit the lab though could write a hit.
Uh, and ain't no denyin' it, nope.
She want it, she can have it, why, cause I'm dyin' it.
The boss boy gotta ride with the flyest bitch
And she the truth. if I'm lyin' then I'm dyin' man.
This other chick that I'm divin' in.
She a good look that's why we always dinin' in.
Chea, in LA, we at Katana, or in Chi-Town, we straight to Benihana's.
And how she doin' man, she get it proper, damn.
Three hours and we both kept on our Pradas.
I had my loafers, she was in them heels.
Berg and the Y.B.'s makin' big deals.

Hey sexy lady,
It was nice to know you (it was nice to know ya)
But I gotta move on (yeah)
Hey sexy lady,
It was nice to know you (it was nice to know ya)
But I got to move on (yeah)

Get 'cha lean on, shawty bring it back.
Go get 'cha lean on, shawty bring it back.
Ah get 'cha lean on, shawty bring it back.
Get 'cha lean on, shawty bring it back
Oh, come on.
