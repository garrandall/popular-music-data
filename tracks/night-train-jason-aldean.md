I've been thinkin' 'bout you all day baby
Waitin' on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town
I got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight
Yeah...


About a mile off old mill road 
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope it's gonna be a long one
And if we're lucky it's movin' slow
Wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
Lyin' next to you on that hillside
Let's go...


About a mile off old mill road 
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train
Let's go listen to the night train


About a mile off old mill road 
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let's go listen to the night train
Let's go listen to the night train
