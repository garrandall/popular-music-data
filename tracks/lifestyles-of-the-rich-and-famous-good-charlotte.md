Always see it on TV
Or read it in magazines
Celebrities that want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talkin' about how hard life can be
I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble
And they'd fall, they would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Aways complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them

Did you know if you were famous
You could kill your wife?
And there's no such thing as twenty-five to life
As long as you got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught
And you were smoking crack
McDonalds wouldn't even wanna take you back?
You could always just run for mayor of D.C
I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble
And they'd fall, they would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
We got so many problems
Think I could solve them
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
We'll take your clothes, cash, cars, and homes
Just stop complainin'
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
