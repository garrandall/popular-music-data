Always see it on TV
Or read it in the magazines
Celebrities want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talkin' about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walkin' in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall (fall)

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them

Well, did you know when you were famous you could kill your wife
And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smokin' crack
McDonald's wouldn't even wanna take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.

I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them (rob them)

They would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
You got so many problems
Think I could solve them

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
We'll take your clothes, cash, cars and homes, just stop complainin'

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
