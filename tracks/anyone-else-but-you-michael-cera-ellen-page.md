You're part time lover
And a full time friend
The monkey on the back
Is the latest trend
Don't see what
Anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

Here is a church
And here is a steeple
We sure are cute
For two ugly people
Don't see what
Anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

We both have
Shiny happy fits
Of rage
I want more fans
You want more stage
Don't see
What anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

I'm always tryin'
To keep it real
Now I'm in love
With how you feel
I don't see
What anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

I kiss you
On the brain
In the shadow
Of the train
I kiss you
All starry eyed
My body swings
From side to side
I don't see
Wwhat anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

The pebbles forgive me
The trees forgive me
So why can't
You forgive me?
I don't see
What anyone can see
In anyone else
But you

Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du du du du
Du, du, du, du
I don't see
What anyone can see
In anyone else
But you
