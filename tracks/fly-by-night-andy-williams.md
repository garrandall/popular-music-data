Fly by night (fly by night)
Please pity me (fly by night)
I fall in love so easily

Oh, fly by night (fly by night)
Don't fly away (from me)

Take my heart (fly by night)
It's yours alone (fly by night)
Forever more to have and own

Oh, fly by night (fly by night)
Don't fly away (from me)

Be my angel true
Not my butterfly
For though they both have wings
Angels don't say goodbye

In my arms (fly by night)
There's love for you (fly by night)
So, please say you love me true

Oh, fly by night (fly by night)
Don't fly away (fly by night)
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)
Don't fly away (fly by night)
Oh, fly by night
