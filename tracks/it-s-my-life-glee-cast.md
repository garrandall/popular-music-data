This ain't a song for the broken hearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed


And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud


(It's my life!)
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life!)


(These are my confessions)
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
(These are my confessions)

If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so thrown, I don't know what to do
But to give Part 2 of my


You better stand tall
When they're calling you out


Don't bend, don't break
Baby, don't back down
These are my confessions


It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
(These are my confessions) I just wanna live while I'm alive


(It's my life)
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
(These are my confessions)


I just wanna live while I'm alive!
(It's my life!)
