My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat

Feel it beat

Something in your eyes
Seems to hypnotize
Every time I look at you
I get butterflies

Something in your smile
Brightens up my day
I just can't help myself
You make me feel this way

And there's nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
Everything would be so fine
Baby, baby, baby if you only knew

My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat

Feel it beat

Everytime we meet
I just can't believe
How everything I plan to say
Disappears from me

I'm thinking of you now
And, baby, there's no doubt
You are my fantasy
The one I dream about

And there's nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
Anything you want from me
Anything you want is what I'll give to you

That's why
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can'y you feel it beat

I can't believe how I feel for you
The fire is burning
And my heart is churning
Tell me, tell me
Can you feel it beat

Oh and now
I can't believe how I feel for you
The fire is burning
And my heart is churning
Tell me, tell me
Can't you feel it beat

(My heart skips a beat)
(Everytime we meet)
Oh, oh
(I don't what to do)
(I'm so in love with you)
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
(I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel it beat

(My heart skips a beat)
(Everytime we meet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I don't what to do)
(I'm so in love with you)
Oh oh
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
(I don't know what to do)
(Can't you feel it beat)
'Cause I love you

(My heart skips a beat)
(Everytime we meet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I don't what to do)
Oh, oh
(I'm so in love with you)
(My heart skips a beat)
(Everytime we meet)
Tell me, tell me
(I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel it beat

(My heart skips a beat)
(Everytime we meet)
My heart, my heart, my heart
(I don't what to do)
(I'm so in love with you)
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
(I don't know what to do)
'Cause I love you

My heart skips a beat
