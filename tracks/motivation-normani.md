I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To  stay and give it tonight
And‚  baby‚ turn around‚ let me give you innovation, hey
'Cause I do it so right


You got that good good, baby‚ don't you?
Got  that good good, baby, don't you?
But  you leavin' solo
Ain't regular‚ that ain't regular
I  ain't gon' keep, keep fightin' for it
Ain't gon' keep, keep fightin' for it
'Cause you know this thing here
Ain't regular, that ain't regular


Fallin'  into the bed
Why would we ever do somethin' instead of
Fallin' into the bed right now? Yeah


I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh I think about it
Think about it, oh take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright


You got a bad one, baby, don't you?
Got a bad one, baby, don't you?
And we both know there's no
One better, boy, no one better, boy
Too late, won't make it, I'ma tell 'em (Yeah)
Get you naked, but I won't tell 'em (Woo)
'Cause you know that there's no
One better, boy, no one better, boy


Fallin' into the bed
Why would we ever do somethin' instead of
Fallin' into the bed right now?
Eh, right now, now


I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight (And give it tonight)
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh I think about it
Think about it, oh take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright


Hey, oh
A little motivation
Oh


I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh I think about it
Think about it, oh take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright


Oh
Oh
