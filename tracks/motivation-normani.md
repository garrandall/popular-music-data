I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation (21), hey
(Gang, gang, gang), 'Cause I do it so right


One look was all it took (21), she know what to do
I swear she read me like a book (Straight up)
Be my motivation. when I come home she gon' cook (On God)
Took her from my ex, they like "Savage you a crook" (21)
I rap for a living so she know I'm off the hook (Facts)
Use to be a dog in the past, now I'm good (On God)
She's a  store, I got it hanging in the hood (On God)
Call her Home Depot, I fill her up with wood (Straight up)
Play with her, you get smoke, capeesh, understood? (Straight up)
Louis skies (Yeah), got Chanel purse on every one of my bags (21)
Brand new Spider, drop the top, let her drive (Skkkrt)
 (21)
Don't take it person', baby, sometimes I be shy (On God)
I'ma leave her when she say "I always lie"
You can't hear the rumors when you're this high in the sky (Facts)
If you can't touch the ground, we compliment each other, fly


I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, ooh, I think about it
Think about it, ooh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright

You got a bad one, baby, don't you?
Got a bad one, baby, don't you?
And we both know there's no
One better, boy, no one better, boy
Too late, won't make it, I'ma tell 'em (Yeah)
Get you naked, but I won't tell 'em (Woo)
'Cause you know that there's no
One better, boy, no one better, boy

Fallin' into the bed
Why would we ever do somethin' instead of
Fallin' into the bed right now?
Eh, right now, now

I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight (And give it tonight)
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, ooh, I think about it
Think about it, ooh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright

Hey, oh
A little motivation
Oh

I'ma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, ooh, I think about it
Think about it, ooh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright

Oh
Oh
