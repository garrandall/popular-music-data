You're full of sugar you're full of spice
You're kinda naughty but you're naughty and nice say-


Ginger bread ginger bread ginger bread ginger bread
Ginger bread ginger bread ginger bread ginger bread
You're full of sugar you're full of spice
You're kinda naughty but you're naughty and nice

My heart beats crazy every time I'm with you
But you're momma says you're much too young to date
We meet at the corner and we share a kiss or two
How long does your momma think we'll wait wait wait


My heart beats crazy every time I'm with you
But you're momma says you're much too young to date
We meet at the corner and we share a kiss or two
How long does your momma think we'll wait wait wait
