No one, no one gets the prize

No one, no one
No one gets the prize

We were best of friends
It all began
He came in to town and changed the plan
I knew she felt, the same as me
Which one of us would it be

Just in fun, fight begun
Before long a web of hate was spun
She pretended same as me
Oh, but friends again we'd never be

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies, and I told him lies
No one, no one gets the prize

She schemed and dreamed and told him dirt
That I was wrong for him
I told him all the boys she'd hurt and I would number them
He was the ray of light that made our hearts live
But either one of us knew really how to give
So we scandalized and criticized
And then we learned how to despise

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies and I lied, I lied yeah
No one, no one gets the prize
No, no, no

Yeah, yeah
Back off

Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure
But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss

I'd defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control whatever moved in my soul
I could tempt
Touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing:

I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure (I was so sure)
But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss
(Taught me who was who was the boss)

Love taught me
Taught me
Taught me
Taught me
I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sue
But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss

I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sue
But love taught me

I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sue
But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss

I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sue
But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss

But love taught me
Who was who was who was the boss
