High school board
They said he was bad
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

He had a knack of getting
All the teachers mad
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

He got his kicks from
Cutting class every day
When he heard the bell ring
He'd run the other way

He had a girlfriend in
The shape of a balloon
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

The fellas all asked him why
You go with such a goon
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

He had to tell his friends
So I don't half to be on guard
Cause I've been always happy
And that big tub of lard, lard

When he heard the bell ring
He'd run the other way

He didn't do his homework
He never passed a test
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Lunch was the class
That he loved the best
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

They caught him sleeping
In the boiler room
The principal hit him
On the head with a broom

He thought he was cool
But he was only a fool
Cause they kicked that
Cool cat out of school
