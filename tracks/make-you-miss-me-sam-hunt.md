You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
All your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Everyone you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
