You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but


Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me


You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that


Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me


Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me


Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me
