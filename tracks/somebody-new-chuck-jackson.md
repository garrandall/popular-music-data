The only way I know how
To tell you that we're through
Is to explain the whole hearted
Truth to you

I've found somebody new
Somebody fine and brand new
And no, no, no, no longer
Am I love in with you

Listen, she's got pretty lips
Flashy eyes
She's telling me sweet things
While you've been telling me lies
Mama, we're through

But it's all right, oh, oh

Yes, I've got somebody new, yeah
Somebody fine and brand new
And no, no, no, no longer
Am I love in with you

Listen, she treats me good
She treats me right
She give me good loving
Morning, noon and night
Baby, we're through

But it's all right

I'm talking about somebody new
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody fine and brand new

It was in my mind, baby
And I had to tell you
That we were through

But, oh, oh, you understand
Don't you, baby, it's all right
