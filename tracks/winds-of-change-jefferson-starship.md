Walk softly through the desert sands 
Careful where you tread 
Underfoot are the visions lost 
Sleeping not yet dead 

Hang on - Winds starting to howl 
Hang on - The beast is on the prowl 
Hang on - Can you hear the strange cry 
Winds of change are blowing by 

Mountains crumble and cities fall 
Don't come to an end 
Just lie scattered on the desert floor 
Waiting for the wind 



You got your life planned carefully 
But you left out one detail 
The hidden hand deals just one round 
And the winds of change prevail 



Walk softly through the desert sand 
Old dreams lead the way 
Nothing new in the sands of time 
Just changes every day 

Hang on - It's starting again 
Hang on - There's no shelter from the wind 
Hang on - Like a fire from the sky 
Winds of change are blowing by
