GO!
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to
Refrain:
First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second geear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right
It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheeled bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To anyplace I know you like
Refrain
It climbs the hills like a Matchless
Cause my Honda' built really light
When I go in to the turns
Better hang on tight
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight
Refrain
