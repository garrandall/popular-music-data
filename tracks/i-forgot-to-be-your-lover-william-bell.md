Have I told you lately that I love you?
Oh, if I didn't, baby, I'm sorry
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms
Oh, when you needed me?

Now I realize that you need love too
And I'll spend my life making love to you

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burden that love will fare?
And have I done the little simple things to show you
Just how much I care?

Oh, I've been workin' for you doin' all I can
To work all the time didn't make me a man

Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'll make it up to you somehow, oh

I forgot to be your lover, yeah, yeah, yeah
So forgot to be your lover
I forgot to be your lover
Baby, I'm so sorry
(I forgot to be your lover)
Come on, baby, if you, if you can find it in youself
If you can it find in youself
To give your baby just a little hair
I forgot to be your lover (I forgot to be your lover)
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry (I forgot to be your lover)
Sorry, sorry, sorry baby
Sorry baby, I'm so sorry
So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so sorry
So sorry baby
I, I make it up to you
Let me think of let me count the ways
Let me count the ways, baby
I'm gonna make it up to you somehow, now
That feel so good, yeah
So feel so good, baby
Don't you like it, don't you wanna me
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna, baby
Want you now
Ah, ah
So sorry, sorry
I make it up, make it up to you somehow, somehow
Oooh

Yeah
So sorry
Mmm...
