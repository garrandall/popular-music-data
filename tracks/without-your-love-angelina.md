Angelina, why are you lying there
And not playing with your blond curling hair
I hear no music, I see no light,
I even see no light in your eyes, your eyes open wide
Staring at me, strange as never before
Is this what you meant, when I shut the door
Oh my God why did you do this to me
I'm back my love, I couldn't be free

Angelina, it's me my love
Finally found out I can't live without your love

Angelina, and your name echoes in the air
Then silence will be long, everything's so rare
As if the world exists no more
My world has been destroyed when I shut the door
And when you're lying there, oh Angelina
I kiss your lips and I caress your hair
Oh my God why did you do this to me
I'm back my love, I couldn't be free
