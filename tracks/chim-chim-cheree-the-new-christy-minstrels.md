Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-ee
A chimney sweep is as lucky
As lucky can be

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off
When I shake hands with you

Now as the ladder of life
Has been strung
A chimney sweep hung
The bottom-most rung

Though I spend my time
In the ashes and smoke
In this whole wide world
There's no happier bloke

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-ee
A chimney sweep is as lucky
As lucky can be

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off
When I shake hands with you

Now in my profession
There's many a time
When I embark
On a perilous climb

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-ee
A chimney sweep is as lucky
As lucky can be

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off
When I shake hands with you

Gables and rooftops
Become Taj Mahal
Then climbing the chimney's
A great Chinese wall

Chim chiminey
Chim chiminey

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-ee
A chimney sweep is as lucky
As lucky can be

Chim chiminey, chim chiminey
Chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off
When I shake hands with you

And that's lucky too
