Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
Bought a motorcycle in his younger days
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band
Fuzzy tought me how to make a livin' off the land
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew
Tought me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field

Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised

Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew
Dirty blonde and curly wearing pants of faded blue
A barefoot bearded swamprat
but a man above all others
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers

Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
