Let me check this number
488-3857

Operator, could you, could you
Ring through that number for me
It's been busy now for about two hours
Thank you very much
It's an emergency, no, I'm
I'm stuck in the phone booth down here

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Is it ringing, thank you
Hello, who's this
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Is my baby there

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Now look here, do me a favor, bro
When she comes, you tell her
I'm waiting for her right here
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
On the corner in the phone booth

She knows where I'm at cause
The light is bright, the street signs
Are black and white

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
She can't miss, I'm on the corner
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Between Love's Street and Fool's Road

You can't miss me, tell her that
(Between Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Thank you
(Between Love's Street and Fool's Road)

Listen to me
Been down Love's Street once
Been down Love's Street twice
And if I go back down Love's Street again
I'll be running with
A loaded pair of dice

Cause I'm stuck in the phone booth
I'm waiting for you, mama, on the corner
Of Love's Street and Fool's Road

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Come get what's good for you
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Come get it, come get it, come get it

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
I been standing for you, baby
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
You can't miss me, baby
I been here all night

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Street sign's so bright
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Street sign, black and white
That's where I'm at

I done told all your friends
Told your mailman too
Just in case you lost my address
Tell you what you got to do

Meet me, meet me
I want you to meet me
We can make it all up, baby
One more time again

I ain't gonna leave here
I'm gonna wait on you, mama...
