Bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like

You say "black", I say "white"
You say "bark", I say "bite"
You say "shark", I say "Hey man,
Jaws was never my scene
And I don't like Star Wars!"

You say "Rolls", I say "Royce"
You say "God" - Give me a choice!
You say "Lord", I say "Christ!"
I don't believe in Peter Pan,
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is

Bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my

Bicycle races are coming your way
So forget all your duties oh yeah!
Fat-bottomed girls they'll be riding today
So look out for those beauties oh yeah

On your marks get set go

Bicycle race bicycle race bicycle race
Bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle bicycle bicycle bicycle
(I want a)
Bicycle race

You say "coke", I say "caine"
You say "John", I say "Wayne"
"Hot dog", I say, "Cool it, man"
I don't wanna be the President of America

You say "smile", I say "cheese"
"Cartier", I say, "Please"
"Income tax", I say "Jesus!"
I don't wanna be a candidate
For Vietnam or Watergate
'Cause all I want to do is

Bicycle bicycle bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle, bicycle (c'mon), bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like
