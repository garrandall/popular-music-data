Long ago in days of old
There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married and had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made has a kink
Chainmail pants with a missing link
