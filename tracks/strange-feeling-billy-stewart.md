I have lived my life
My life, my, my life
In a sad world
(In a sad world)

But I'm gonna tell you
Gonna tell you
I'm gonna tell you
I've found the right girl

She's so gentle and kind
Gentle and kind
Gentle and kind
Gentle and kind
And she treats me like a king
(Just like a king)

Don't you know, child
I said now

I'm gonna tell my friends
My friends, my friends
I'm gonna treat her right
She's my queen

She said she loves me
And she wants to be my wife
And she says she wants to love me
For the rest, the rest of her life

Oh, this strange feeling
Feel, feel, feeling
That she put in my heart

Don't you know, child
I said now
This strange feeling
Feel, feel, feeling
That we'll never, never part
(Never part, we'll never part)

Don't you know now, child
This strange feeling
