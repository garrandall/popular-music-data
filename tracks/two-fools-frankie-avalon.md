Two fools
You for wanting me
Me for putting you down
Two fools
Me for leaving
And you for hanging around
Two fools, two fools
Two fools
You for calling
And me for not being home
Two fools
Me for laughing because
You're crying alone
Two fools, two fools
All that kissing
I've been missing
Since we've been apart
I love you
Two fools
You for loving me
Me for breaking your heart
Two fools
You for suffering
Me for thinking I'm smart
Two fools, two fools
All that kissing
I've been missing
Since we've been apart
I love you
Two fools
You for loving me
Me for breaking your heart
Two fools
You for suffering and
Me for thinking I'm smart
Two fools, two fools
Two fools
