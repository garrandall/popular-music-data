Think of this heart as an old accident
A hardened hit and run
Looking ahead but just a little scared
To keep all eyes on the road

Can you be sure
Will this be some good thing
Lucky stars to reckon appear again and again
Can you believe all that has brought you here
You say come on baby let's go ahead and live

Who ever knows if love's a sleight of hand
Will it hold up to the light
And do you ever stop unravelling a happy end
With a mind still wound up from a fight

Can it be real
Will it be some good thing
Weathering the fortunes
What those stars are gonna bring
Will it stay true
Will we both see the whole thing true
You say come on baby let's go ahead and love

Bird on a wire or heart in your hand
Looking for a place to find some rest
If you batten it down it's not living at all
Leaving's just a different kind of death

Could you believe
Will this be some good thing
A place to lay your head down
And the will to look again
Could it be true
Will we both see the whole thing true
You say come on baby let's go ahead
Come on baby let's go ahead
Come baby let's go ahead and live
