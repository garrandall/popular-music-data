1, 2, 3, 4

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
And you were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
And you were late

Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went round there
Still don't believe it
He was just leaving

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake...
