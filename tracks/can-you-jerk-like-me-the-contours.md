(Oh, yeah) come on, children
(Oh, yeah) hey

Can you do the Jerk
Come on, let's work
Move your shoulders up and down
Your feet don't leave the ground

Anyone can do it
Friends, there's nothing to it
If you're young or old
All it takes is soul

And I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me
Come on, children, hey
(Can you Jerk like me)
Come on, children now
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby, I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me, hey, baby

Get right back in the groove
Like I said, your feet don't move
Get a hump down in your back
Take off all the slack

Come on, let's work
Snap your fingers
Make your backbone jerk
Now you got that feeling
Cause the music got you reeling

And I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me
Come on, children
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby (can you Jerk like me)
I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me, hey, baby
Ow, it's all right

I just wanna know
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby

Now you roll back in the groove
Like I said, your feet don't move
Come on (oh, yeah) let's work
Snap those fingers
Make your backbone jerk

Now you got that feeling
Cause the music's got you reeling

I just wanna know
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby
(Can you Jerk like me)
Come on, children
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby
(Can you Jerk like me)
Come on, children now
