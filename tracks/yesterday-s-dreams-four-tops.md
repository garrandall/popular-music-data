Yesterday's dreams today are sorrow
Just like your love, girl, fading away
Yesterday's love won't last till tomorrow
I know you're leaving, but what can I say?
Oh (oh) wish that I could find a way
To make you stay; I've got to prove to you
That I love you, I need you, oh how I need you
Don't go (don't go) don't go (don't go)
If you go, don't you know
You're gonna leave me with...

Yesterday's dreams though gone & behind us
They're lonely reminders of plans that we made
Yesterday's plans today gone forever
But they're locked here inside me & they never will fade
Although (although) you may go, time will show me
Dreamin' still, & I always will
'Cause I love you, I need you, oh how I need you
Don't you go (don't go) don't you leave me, baby (don't go)
Baby don't you leave me (don't go) please don't leave me
(Don't go) here with yesterday's dreams

Although (although) you may go, time will show me
Dreamin' still, & I always will
Yesterday's dreams are a small pile of ashes
With one burning hope that hangs on
