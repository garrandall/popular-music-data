Long, long and lonely nights
I cry my eyes out over you
Wondering if I did right
And why you left me
With a broken heart

Oh, long, long and lonely nights
Oh, how I miss you, my dear
Please, please, come back to me
How I wish you were here

As I go along my lonely way
I visualize your face
When I pass through my doorway
What's left for me to face

Oh, long, long and lonely nights
I guess you're never coming home
Long, long and lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone

As I go along my lonely way
I visualize your face
When I pass through my doorway
What's left for me to face

Oh, long, long and lonely nights
I guess you're never coming home
Long, long and lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone

Please, please, come back to me
You've been gone too long
