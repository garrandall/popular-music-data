You had nothin' when I met you baby
But look what you got now
Sometimes I wonder, did I make a mistake
When I brought you to the south
Gonna send you back to Walker
Girl, that's where you belong
Since you been got in the big city
Well you been started treatin' me wrong

Your mama and your daddy done told me baby
Not to bring you to the south
I brought you to the city
And the bright lights knocked you out
I'm gonna send you back to Walker
Girl that's where you belong, I know
Since you been got in the big city
Well you been started treatin' me wrong...

Your mama and your daddy done told me baby
Not to bring you to the south
I brought you from the city
And the bright lights knocked you out
I'm gonna send you back to Walker
Girl that's where you belong, I know baby
Since you've been got in the big city
Well you been started treatin' me wrong
I know you been treatin' me wrong
Ah, so long
I'm gonna send you back where you belong
Alright, alright
Put you down
Send you back home
Goodbye Baby
So long
Hey, hey, goodbye baby
