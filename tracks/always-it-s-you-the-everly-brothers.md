When I feel downhearted
When I'm feeling blue
When I'm low and lonely
Who do I turn to?
It's you, always it's you


When I'm dreaming daydreams
Who comes into view?
Who shares all my daydreams
Who makes them come true?
It's you, always it's you


When I feel like smiling
You're the reason why
If I ever lost you
I'd cry and cry


Oh, hold me close my true love
Kiss me tenderly
There is only one love
One alone for me
It's you, always it's you
Always it's you
