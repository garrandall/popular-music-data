Ooh la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la-la

I can't be still there
Feel my heart beat
Ooh la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la-la

I can't hide this emotion
Let me tell you that i found love
Ooh, when you see me smiling
Don't you worry
I just learned the life of love
I'm gonna spread the happiness that i am feeling
All around oh oh

I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world (i found love)
I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world
This time love is mine

Yea
Ooh la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la-la

Ooh, he's got me acting crazy
Like a girl thats never been kissed before
He's got the look of just the guy
That i've been waiting for
Oh oh, i tell you

I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world (i found love)
I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world
This time love is mine

Yea
I found a girl who's sheer perfection
She keeps me moving in the right direction
I'm on time and she's all mine
Now im young at heart
But thats all fine

I found a boy with the sweetest eyes
He may be smart, but the boy is wise
When he does the dance im in a deep trance
Now i'm hoping for a real romance

Mmm, my worries fade away
He holds me tighter
All the time
Hes got just what it takes
To keep me smiling
All my life

(Instrument break)
I found love, i found lo-ove

I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world (i found love)
I found love this time
Nobody's gonna steal it away
Gonna tell the whole world
This time love is mine
