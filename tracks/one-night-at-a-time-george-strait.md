I'm not yours and baby you're not mine.
We've got something that sure is fine.
Let's take our love one night at a time.

There's one thing that we both agree.
I like you and baby you like me.
Let's take our love one night at a time.


All night, love all night, practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time.

Oh I think about you all day long.
It feels so good, it can't be wrong.
I got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on.

Tomorrow well that's another day.
Come on baby, now whatta you say.
Let's take our love one night at a time.
