She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't ask her why she needs to be so free
She's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained to a life
Where nothing's gained and nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
You gotta catch your dreams before they run away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you might lose your mind
Is life unkind?

But goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Oh goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
