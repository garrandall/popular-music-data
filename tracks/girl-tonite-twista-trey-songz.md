It's getting late lil mama (stay late)
We been in the club too long
Let me take you out to my home
Tell me what a nigga gotta do
To get you out that thong
When are you gonna really make up ya mind shorty
See Twista work that skill
Now can I get up in it from behind shorty
Show you what I'm working with (oh)
Come on let me take you to the penthouse suite
Pull out some old school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat (oh)
Now shorty come in
Show me you can take it boo
Let me fuck you first now girl
Show me what you can do
Come an fuck me reverse cowgirl
Doing things that'll get you gone
When we on the couch I can make you moan
Eat you up when we in the kitchen
Let you get on top when we by the stove
When she told me to do it faster
That's when  I dug deeper
Now every time I see her (mmm)
I gots to freak her cause

When I touch her she like (Ohhh)
When I hug her (Ohhh)
When I rub her she like (Ohhh)
When we cut it's like (Ohhh)
Then she got me sayin' (Girl Tonite... Yeaa)
When I touch her she like (Ohhh)
When I hug her (Ohhh)
When I rub her she like (Ohhh)
When we cut it's like (Ohhh)
Then she got me sayin' (Girl Tonite, Girl... Girl... Girl)

Make her feel like she popped the pill
Got her feeling ecstasy
Took her to the bedroom
About to make her an overnight celebrity
I finna get up in the sack
And I hope you ready for me girl
Finna hit it from the back
While I'm bumpin' Ready for the World
I want you to hold me
While I'm kissin ova ya body slowly
Give it to you like a O.G.
Show me how you work them walls... Down
Show me how you work them jaws
And in the bed when the faucet run
You will catch that drain
That's why I love gettin' freaky wit you
Cause you's a nasty thang
Shorty please... That's right (Show me how you work them walls... Down)

Cause when I touch her she like (Ohhh)
When I hug her (Ohhh)
When I rub her she like (Ohhh)
When we cut it's like (Ohhh)
Then she got me sayin' (Girl Tonite)
When I touch her she like (Ohhh)
When I hug her (Ohhh)
When I rub her she like (Ohhh)
When we cut it's like (Ohhh... Yea baby)
Then she got me sayin' (Girl Tonite)

Hit it to that Jodeci (Yeaaa)
Hit it to that Jagged Edge (Yeaa)
Hit it to that New Edition
Get you get that cool it boo
(Don't you worry about a damn thang... No)
See how I do it to it
When I sip some do it to it fluid
Hit it to some Isley Brothers
Hit it to some Sade Yes
Hit it to some R. Kelly
And hit it to some Marvin Gaye
(Don't you worry about a damn thang... No)
See how I do it to it
Gotta sip that fluid
When I touch her she like Ohhh
Say don't ya worry about a damn thang
No, no, no, no, no, no girl
Cuz when I touch her she like
When I rub her
When I hug her
When I love her
When I touch her she like ohhoh
