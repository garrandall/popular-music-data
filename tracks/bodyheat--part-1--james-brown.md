Yeah
(Body heat)
Yeah
(Yeah)


When your body get funky big time
And you need some love from fascination


What's that (Body heat)
What's that (Body heat)


When your body don't do what you want it to
And you don't do it because you know you're through


What's that (Body heat)
What's that (Body heat)


When you can't get your body please
And you need some love for your tension easer


What's that
(Body heat)
What's that
(Body heat)
Ah, payback


Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all


You got to turn on the heat, take off that dress
Put on the heat, take off that dress
Turn on the heat, take off that dress
Turn on the heat, give me some air
Can't go nowhere, I'm having bad luck
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
Got to release the 
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck


Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Take me


When I was a little boy about the age of one
My mother told mem, "You loving son of a gun"
When I was a little boy about the age of two
Knew what I had to do
When I was a little boy about the age of three
Don't want nobody bothering me
When I was a little boy about the age of four
Back up, had to take it myself, gonna give me some more
When I was a little boy about the age of ten
About to catch myself, I want to do it again
When I was a little boy about age eleven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Growing up, turn up the heat
Take off that dress


Better go to church, y' all
Got to go to church, y'all



Give my loving
Give my loving
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
One, two, three
Hit it, Jimmy


(Body heat, body heat)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Yeah
(Yeah)
