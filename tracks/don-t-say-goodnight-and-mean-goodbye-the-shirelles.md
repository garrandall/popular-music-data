Tonight you're actin' strange I find
And you got something on your mind
Something's wrong, I can see it
See it in your eyes
Whoa darlin
Don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Oh, it may just be all in my mind
But tonight doesn't seem like other times
Then you were laughing and gay
But now I hear you sighing, oh yes I do
Whoa whoa whoa darlin'
Don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Have I lost touch with your heart
Or do I just worry too much?
I couldn't stand for us to part
Because I love you much, much too much
So don't let this kiss be our last kiss
Let there be other nights of holding you like this
Please don't walk away, pretty baby
With that look in your eyes
Oh no no, whoa darling
Don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Whoa oh oh baby
Don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Oh oh oh, don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
