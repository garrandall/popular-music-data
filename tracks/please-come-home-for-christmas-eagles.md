Bells will be ringing this sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues 
My baby's gone I have no friends 
To wish me greetings once again 

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night" 
Christmas carols by candlelight 
Please come home for Christmas 
Please come home for Christmas 

If not for Christmas by New Years night 
Friends and relations send salutations 
Sure as the stars shine above 
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear 

The time of year to be with the ones you love 
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam 
Christmas and new Years will find you home 
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain 

And I'll be happy, happy once again 
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
