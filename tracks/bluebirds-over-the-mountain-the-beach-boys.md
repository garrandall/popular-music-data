Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

Oh everyone in every land
Please give me a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

Oh bring my baby back
I don't know why she's been so long
But all I know is that she's gone
Oh bring my baby back to me
Well I'm in pain can't you see

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
I guess that's why we fell in love
And now she's gone and all I have to say is

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea yeah
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

Bring my baby
Oooo Baby
Oooo oo oo oo
