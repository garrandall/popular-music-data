Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to the kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true miles away

Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live love forever, as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As one, come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life now in review

And as you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true

As you glide in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
I'm free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life now in review
