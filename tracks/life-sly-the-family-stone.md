Life, Life
Past the clouds
You don't have to come down

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live


You might get angry some times
But don't let it turn you around
All you gotta do
Is get your livin' down

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live


You might be scared of somethin' - look at Mr. Stewart!
He's the only person he has to fear
He'd only let himself get near
He don't trust nobody
If he stopped bein' so shady
He could have a nice young lady

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live


You're gonna be sad sometime
You might wake up to find your pet is gone
But maybe
He's tired of bein' alone
Dog gets hip, it has to go 
If you're lovin' you can't be sad no more

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live
