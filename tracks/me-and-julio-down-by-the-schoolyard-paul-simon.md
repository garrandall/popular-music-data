The Mama pajama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
When the Papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investigation


It's against the law, it was against the law
What the Mama saw, it was against the law


The Mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The Papa said "Oy! if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"


Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard




In a couple of days, they're gonna take me away
But the press let the story leak
When the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek


Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
