The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out he began to shout
And he started the investigation
It's against the law
It was against the law
What the mama saw
It was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Everytime my name gets mentioned
The papa said oy if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
But I done know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they come and
Take me away
But the press let the story leak
Now when the radical priest
Come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
M m m me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
Yeah, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
