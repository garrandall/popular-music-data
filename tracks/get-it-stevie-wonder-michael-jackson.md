Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me
Some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says


That no one's going to get it
No one's going to get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will
No one's going to get it
No one's going to get it, oh no
But someone's got to get it
And I know that I will be the one who will
Going to get it, her love
Going to get it, her kisses
Going to get it, her heart
Going to get it, get it


Miss Lady Girl
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love
Of her life is about to be found
They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say


That no one's Going to get it
No one's Going to get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will
No one's Going to got it
No one's Going to get It, oh no
But someone's Going to get it
And I know that I will be the one who will
Going to get it, her love
Going to get it, her kisses
Going to get it, her heart
Going to get it, gonna get it
