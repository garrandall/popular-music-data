In Truey, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen em twirl then he drop, nigga
And We Keep them 9 milli's on my block, nigga
And Monte Keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wilding, he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Running through these checks till' I pass out
Your shawty gave me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been selling crack since like the 5th grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be getting money till' I fall out
You talking cash dog, I goes all out
Shawty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussy cats inside my dog house
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie like we cops on 'em
With the 16's, we gon' put some shots on em'
I send a lil' thot to send the drop on em'
She gon' call me up and I'mma sick the hots on 'em
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so Hard
But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if there's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin 'out The AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them things bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho
Subwave, free Greezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teaming, ho
Mitch caught a body 'bout a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweaking, ho
Run up on that nigga get to squeezing, ho
Everybody catching bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully yo
I'mma run up, put that gun on 'em
I'mma run up, go dumb on 'em
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit
Doodoo stain gang
