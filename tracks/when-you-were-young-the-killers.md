You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young


Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young


And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young


They say the devil's water â€” it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while


You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)
(Like you imagined when)
When you were young


I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know
