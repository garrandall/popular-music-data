(Khris James, what the fuck?)
(Goddamn, BJ with another one)
Let's go
(Ayy, turn me up, XO)
We finna step up, yeah
(Mmh, that Lil Top), Lil Top, Lil Top, yeah
I'm really Top, really, I'm really Top, yeah
I'm really Top, hey, I'm really Top, yeah
I don't want that top, yeah, it's on, lil' nigga


I cut off my day ones for the win (Win)
I just pulled up in that black Maybach, you can't see in (Skrrt)
Up, got plenty racks, I keep that strap with one cocked in
Not even close with family, why the fuck would I want friends? (Tell me that, lil' nigga), let's go
Fuck the ones who talkin', bitch, I'm lit, alright (Alright)
A million dollars worth of cars, no lease, no rent
I'm only twenty, can't nobody tell me shit, I'm slime (I'm slime)
Bitch cross the line, I lose my mind, I bust that iron, look


Pistol totin' while swervin' in a Rolls-Royce, yeah
Just send my million through an invoice (Let's go, let's go)
I spend plenty blue face racks on shit I wear once, yeah
Just like that ho, man, I can't keep nothin' (Can't keep a ho), let's go


Lost my brothers, I ain't friendly, nigga (Friendly, nigga)
I spent two-fifty on my Bentley (Oh)
Straight up out the mud, we from the trenches, nigga
The realest ones had the hardest way of livin' (Talk to 'em)
But who want smoke? I drop them bags, I'm quick to send it, pussy nigga
Whip out with Glocks out from our Hellcats and some benjis, broke ass nigga
Fuck their opinion, it don't help out how I'm livin' (Yeah)
Let's fight with millions, fuck whoever think I'm trippin', and yeah
I pull up black, and I see trouble, cock one in it, yeah (I cock one in it)
I'm full of Xanax, all my brothers rollin' with me, yeah (They rollin' with me)
I'm up and focused, probably blow if you come near me playin'
Got all my pockets filled with hundreds, doin' the murder man (Let's go)
The biggest boss, ride through the North, I keep my gun in hand (Gun in hand)
I don't wanna talk, I let it off while all these diamonds dance
R.I.P. Dump, everyday dump a hundred some rounds on them
Came from the bottom, they don't even know, this money got 'em starin' (Let's go)


(Mmh, that Lil Top), yeah, mmh, that Lil Top now
Mmh, that Lil Top, yeah, mmh, that Lil Top, yeah
Mmh, that Lil Top, heard that, mmh, that Lil Top, yeah
That Lil Top, uh, hmm, that Lil Top, yeah


Pistol totin' while swervin' in a Rolls-Royce, yeah
Just send my million through an invoice (In through an invoice)
I spend plenty blue face racks on shit I wear once, yeah
Just like that ho, man, I can't keep nothin'


One, two, three million, I bet it, placed a bet, I set it
It's way too hot, clear out the block, spin on your shit and wet it
Do it in style, Prada'd up, bitch, we flexin' while we steppin'
I don't want to talk about that shit, this money my confession
I say this new Bentley a go-kart, drive this bitch like Herbie
I just threw one of them thangs back, I came through, I was swervin'
Get out of line, we smush your brains back, that murder shit be urgent
4KTrey, we put this bitch straight to your face, you think I'm worried (Yeah)


Lil Top, yeah, mmh, that Lil Top now
Mmh, that Lil Top, yeah, mmh, that Lil Top, yeah
Mmh, that Lil Top, heard that, mmh, that Lil Top, yeah
That Lil Top, uh, hmm, that Lil Top, yeah


Pistol totin' while swervin' in a Rolls-Royce, yeah
Just send my million through an invoice
I spend plenty blue face racks on shit I wear once, yeah
Just like that ho, man, I can't keep nothin' (Goddamn, BJ with another one)
