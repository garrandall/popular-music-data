I cried all night long when I
Found out what your mama told you
My mama said, don't cry now, girl
I'm gonna tell you what to do

And then she said, don't wait
Til he makes up his mind now
Put down your foot down and
Get him in line now

Let him know that
You can't wait around now
You've been his girl
For a long, long time now

My mama told me
Don't let him shop around
Oh, no, don't let him shop around
(Don't you let him)

You know a good man
Is hard to find now
A stitch in time
May just save nine now

You know they say
That love is blind now
He's been fooling you
A long, long time now

My mama told me
Don't let him shop around
Oh, no, don't let him shop around
(Don't you let him)

Let him know
You're the best in the field now
Get your man and you
Better make him yield now

It's up to you, girl
To make him see
You've got let him know
That you're just like me now

Hold him tight
Don't let him retreat now
Make sure that your kisses
Are sweet now

My mama told me
Don't let him shop around

Oh, let him know
You're the best in the field now
Get your man and you
Better make him yield now

It's up to you, girl
To make him see
You've got let him know
That you're just like me now

Hold him tight
Don't let him retreat now
Make sure that your kisses
Are sweet now

You're competing with
The best that he's meeting now
You've got to figure
How to knock him off his feet now

My mama told me
Don't let him shop around

Now let me tell you something, honey
Oh, yeah, you know his
Family's in the money

And if he takes you for his wife now
Yeah, yeah, you'll have the
Better things in life now

You better make him
Take your hand now
You understand now, girl
Get the man now
Girl, I know you can now
You're my darling
