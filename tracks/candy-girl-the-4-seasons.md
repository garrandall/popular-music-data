Dedicated to all my niggas up North 
Dedicated to the dirty South of course 
Dedicated to all my niggas on the East 
Dedicated to West Coast niggas is beasts ... 
This from us to you and all of them 
don't get gas my nigga watch your rims 

I started off in a hood, in what you would call a lemon.. 
Me? I was a nerd, niggas thought it was a gimmick. 
Now I got the maybach, curtains in linen.. 
White maranella with the burgundy in it. 
Tinted? 
For real. 
Now watch how we spin it. 
River side drive in about 5 minutes 
4 5 2.. 
achoo.. 
Make a nigga sneeze when we ride by you. 
Ice cream jeans with a march yellow top.. 
Polo 7-5-8s with socks. 
Am I high? 
Fa sho 
How we count dough? 
We count commas.. 
Yall niggas count 0's 
Come to VIP nigga we can count hos... 
Don't forget the candy pan sittin on vouges. 
Plus I got banana clips under my clothes.. 
This is redicated to niggas that flips O's. 



Ayo come to Garcon.. 
Y saunt lauran 
You ever seen the hard bottoms on a long vauze? 
The bullets make a nigga hit the bottom real hard.. 
You ever seen the spikes on the new Lou Vuittons 
Spike a bitch drink make a bitch go hard 
Red Air Max with the fuckin Go-Karts 
When you already did it, what the fuck is go hard? 
Synchronize automotives, walk out with no charge. 
Wit yo broad, 
Oh lord, while your wife at somewhere typin 
We on Rodeo somewhere swipin. 
You do it like Nike, my shit Lightnin 
Back to back Lambo, inside frightnin 
This shit criminal we should be indicted.. 
Your chicks riding shotgun, had that as dikin 
Like Paquiao fightin. 
This shit is exciting 



Top down, bumpin Bar-Kays.. 
Hermes bucket with the Tom Ford Shades. 
Four shades.. 
Four seasons.. 
Six-Fours.. 
More reasons.. 
More money.. 
Whore season. 
Are you listenin mah? 
Your cheesin. 
We at the Staples on the floor, whole season.. 
Its the pink slip club, nigga no leasin. 
Ya ex-boyfriend, Policin... 
Brush em off like my moncler fleece son 
You know I'm gang affiliated, don't get naughty. 
We could call henchmen.. 
Or we could call shorty. 
Or we could call Hector.. 
Or we could call Jorge. 
Papi owe me favors.. 
I know he wont ignore me. 
Everybody loco niggas gotta show me.. 
Tell ya girl there's a fire in my pants.. 
Blow me.
