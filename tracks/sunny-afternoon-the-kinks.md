The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon

And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, Save me, Save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat poppa trying to break me

I'd like to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

My boyfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to his ma and pa
Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sittin' here, sippin' at my ice cold beer

Lazin' on a sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away

Give me two good reasons why I oughtta stay

I'd like to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
