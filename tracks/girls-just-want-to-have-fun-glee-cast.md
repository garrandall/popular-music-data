I came home in the middle of the night
My father says, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Well, Daddy dear, you're still number one
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, they...

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Well, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, they...

That's all they really want...
Those girls, they wanna have fun

Some boys take a beautiful girl
Oh, and they hide her away from the rest of the world
Well, not me, I wanna be the one in the sun
Girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, they...

That's all they really want...
Those girls, they wanna have fun
