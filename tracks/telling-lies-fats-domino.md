You been telling me lies
And I know it
(And ya know it)
There's no love in you eyes
'Cause it show it
('Cause it show it)
'Cause every time I hold you
In my arms
You're tellin lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

You said you wanted me for your honey
(For your honey)
But all you wanted was my money
(For your money)
You didn't even try to make me satisfied
Your tellin lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

You know you made me love you
When you roll those great big eyes
And although I didn't know it
They were only starting those lies

You been tellin me things and you hide it
(And you hide it)
I know I can't leave 'cause I tried it
('Cause you tried it)
'Cause as long as you hold me in my arms
You tellin lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

You know you made me love you
When you roll those great big eyes
And although I didn't know it
They were only starting those lies

You been tellin me things and you hide it
(And you hide it)
I know I can't leave 'cause I tried it
('Cause you tried it)
'Cause as long as you hold me in my arms
You tellin lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
