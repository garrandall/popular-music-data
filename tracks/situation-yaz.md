Blue eyed dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation
Pick me up and shake the doubt
Baby, I can't do without


Don't mess around
You bring me down
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


I remember only for an hour
Move right through me
Can you feel the power
I don't know what's going on
It scares me
But it won't be long


Don't mess around
You bring me down
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


Move out, move out, move out
Move out, move out, move out


Now he's in control
He is my lover
Nations stand against him
He's your brother
Been a long time
Been a long time now
I'll get to you somehow


Move out
Don't mess around
Move out
You bring me down
Move out
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


Move out
Don't mess around
Move out
You bring me down
Move out
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


Move out, move out, move out


Move out
Don't mess around
Move out
You bring me down
Move out
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


Now he's in control
He is my lover
Nations stand against him
He's your brother
Been a long time
Been a long time now
I'll get to you somehow


Move out
Don't mess around
Move out
You bring me down
Move out
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out


Move out
Don't mess around
Move out
You bring me down
Move out
How you get about
Don't make a sound
Just move out
