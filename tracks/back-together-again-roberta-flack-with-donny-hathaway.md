Seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I missed you, missed you too

'Cause you, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin
You, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we defeated
And I'm here out in hand
You take all that I got and you need it, baby

'Cause you, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin
You, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin

Love will last forever, forever
We can make it real, got to be real
Say you'll leave me never, leave me never
We can truly feel what you feel
I feel like you back together, yeah, yeah, yeah

Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle
To stay, yeah

'Cause you, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin
You, you and I, I, I back together again
Got the world in a spin

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
So easy to do when you care

Love will last forever, forever
We can make it real, got to be real
Say you'll leave me never, leave me never
We can truly feel what you feel
I feel like you back together

Oh back together again
Oh back together again
Oh back together again
