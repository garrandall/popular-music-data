Dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin...

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good makes a grown man cry
Sweet Cherry Pie

Swingin' on the front porch 
Swingin' on the lawn 
Swingin' where we want 
'Cause there ain't nobody home 
Swingin' to the left 
And swingin' to the right 
If I think about baseball
I'll swing all night yea 

Swingin' in the living room 
Swingin' in the kitchen 
Most folks don't 'cause 
They're too busy bitchin' 
Swingin' in there 'cause 
She wanted me to feed her 
So I mixed up the batter 
And she licked the beater 

I scream you scream 
We all scream for her 
Don't even try 'cause 
You can't ignore her 

She's my cherry pie 
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise 
Tastes so good 
Make a grown man cry 
Sweet cherry pie oh yea 
She's my cherry pie 
Put a smile on your face 
Ten miles wide 
Looks so good 
Bring a tear to your eye 
Sweet cherry pie 

Swingin' to the drums 
Swingin' to guitar 
Swingin' to the bass 
In the back of my car 
Ain't got money
Ain't got no gas 
But we'll get where 
We're goin' if we 
Swing real fast 

I scream you scream 
We all scream for her 
Don't even try 'cause 
You can't ignore her 

She's my cherry pie 
Cool drink of water 
Such a sweet surprise 
Tastes so good 
Make a grown man cry 
Sweet cherry pie oh yea 
She's my cherry pie 
Put a smile on your face 
Ten miles wide 
Looks so good 
Bring a tear to your eye 
Sweet cherry pie, yeah, pie

Swing it! All night long, 
Swing it! 
Swingin the bathroom 
Swingin' on the floor 
Swingin' so hard 
We forgot to lock the door 
In walks her daddy 
Standin' six foot four 
He said you ain't gonna swing
With my daughter no more 

She's my cherry pie 
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise 
Tastes so good 
Make a grown man cry 
Sweet cherry pie oh yea 
She's my cherry pie 
Put a smile on your face 
Ten miles wide 
Looks so good 
Bring a tear to your eye 
Sweet cherry pie 
Sweet cherry pie

Swing it!
