Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long

Everybody, all you people gather 'round
And let your body music, move it up and move it down

We're gonna use it up, gonna wear it out
Ain't nothing left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three ah shake

Everybody, body looking good tonight
You've got that hungry feeling for some loving, it's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)

We're gonna use it up (use it up), gonna wear it out (oh wear it out)
Ain't nothing left in this whole world I care about
Log on to kill this message.
I said one two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three ah shake your body down

(Use it up)

We're gonna use it up (use it up), gonna wear it out (oh wear it out)
Ain't nothing left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three ah shake your body down

Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo

We're gonna use it up (use it up), gonna wear it out (oh wear it out)
Ain't nothing left in this whole world I care about
We're gonna use it up (use it up), gonna wear it out (oh wear it out)
Ain't nothing left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three ah shake

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
(Shake it on down) use it up (shake it on down)
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
(Shake it on down) use it up (shake it on down) oh wear it out
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
