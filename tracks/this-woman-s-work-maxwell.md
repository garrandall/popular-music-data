Pray God you can cope
I'll stand outside
This woman's work
This woman's world
Oh it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the Father

I know you've got a little life in you yet
Now I know you've got a lot of strength left
Now I know you've got a little life in you yet
I know you've got a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
Should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've said that we never said
And all the things we should've done that we never did
All the things we should've given but I didn't

Oh, darling, make it go, make it go away

Give me these moments
Give them back to me
Give me your little kiss

Give me your...
I know you have a little life in you yet
Give me your hand, babe
I know you have a lot of strength left
Give me that pretty hand
I know you have a little life in you yet
Show me you understand
I know you have a lot of strength left

My love child
I know you have a little life in you yet
Whatever you need me
I know you have a lot of strength left
Give me your hand
I know you have a little life in you yet
Give me your hand
I know you have a lot of strength left

Should be crying but I just can't let it go, baby
Should be hopin' but I can't stop thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'.
Of all the things we should've said that we never said
All the things we should've done that we never did
All the things that you wanted from me
All the things that you needed from me
All the things I should've given but I didn't

Oh, darling, make it go away, just make it go away
