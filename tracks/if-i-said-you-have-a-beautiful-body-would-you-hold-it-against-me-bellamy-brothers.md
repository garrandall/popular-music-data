If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 
If I swore you were an angel, 
Would you treat me like the devil tonight 
If I were dying of thirst 
Would your flowing love come quench me 
If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 

Now we could talk all night about the weather 
Could tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast 
I could ask alot of crazy questions 
Or ask you what I really want to know 

If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 
If I swore you were an angel, 
Would you treat me like the devil tonight 
If I were dying of thirst 
Would your flowing love come quench me 
If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 

Now rain can fall so soft against the window 
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky 
But daddy always told me, "Don't make small talk" 
He said, "Come on out and say what's on your mind" 

If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 
If I swore you were an angel, 
Would you treat me like the devil tonight 
If I were dying of thirst 
Would your flowing love come quench me 
If I said you had a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 

If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me 
If I swore you were an angel, 
Would you treat me like the devil tonight 
If I were dying of thirst 
Would your flowing love come quench me 
If I said you have a beautiful body 
Would you hold it against me
