She said, "I'm fine, I'm OK," cover up your trembling hands
There's indecision when you know you ain't got nothing left
Well, the good times never stay
And the cheap thrills always seem to fade away
(When will we fall down?)
When will we fall
When will we fall down? (When will we fall down?)


Jump back, got to get out of here
Been too, too long this time, yeah
Jump back, got to get out of here
When will, when will we fall down?


She hates her life, she hates her skin, she even hates her friends
Tries to hold on to all the reputations she can't mend
And there's some chance we could fail
But the last time, someone was always there for bail
(When will we fall down?)
When will we fall
When will we fall down? (When will we fall down?)


Jump back, got to get out of here
Been too, too long this time, yeah
Jump back, got to get out of here
When will, when will we fall down?
When will we, when will we fall down?
When will we fall?
(When will, when will, when will, when will
When will we fall down?)


She said, "I'm fine, I'm OK," cover up your trembling hands
There's indecision when you know you ain't got nothing left
For the last time, conscience calls
For a good friend, I was never there at all
(When will we fall down?)
When will we fall
When will we fall down? (When will we fall down?)


Jump back, got to get out of here
Been too, too long this time, yeah
Jump back, got to get out of here
When will, when will we fall down?
When will we?
When will we fall down?
When will we fall?
