I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
But is there any wonder
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade
We'll put our hearts together
Now we are one I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
I'm in the mood for love
