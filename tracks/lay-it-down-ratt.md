I know you don't really know me
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not being scared if you never please me

You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now

Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down

Under the sheets you will find me
I know that nothin's for free
You take what's good for your pleasin'
I'll take what's good for this crazy evening

You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now

Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down

"And I know you only want romance."
"I'll give you all that I can."

If you give me just one chance
To prove myself
In love

Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Yeah yeah yeah

Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
