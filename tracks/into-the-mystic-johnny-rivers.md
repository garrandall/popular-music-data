We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won 
As we sailed into the mystic

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly 
Into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows, I will be coming home
Mmm, and when the fog horn blows, I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul 
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will flow 
Into the mystic

When that fog horn blows,you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows, I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul 
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will flow 
Into the mystic

Come on, girl
Too late to stop now
