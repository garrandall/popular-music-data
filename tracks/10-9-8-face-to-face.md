I'll be your loaded dice
You're holding all the cards
You set the tone whenever I'm with you
You make up all the rules
In this game of fools

I see your signals change
They go from green to red
It's always stop & go when the colors are changing
Never let on, never let on
Look to the left, look to the right
Why can't you look me straight in the eye?

CHORUS
10-9-8
I'm always countin down
You feel the pressure when you're under the gun
6-5-4
I'm always countin down
Isn't it funny, I never get to 1

I'll be your only chance
I play the only role
I go the distance whenever I'm with you
You make up all the rules
In this game of fools
Can you hear me in the dark
I'm walkin on the wire
I'm on the edge, it's always my time for fallin
Never let on, never let on
Look to the left, look to the right
Why can't you look me straight in the eye?

CHORUS

(bridge)
Never let on
Never let on
Never let on

Never let on
Never let on
Never let on

CHORUS x 3
