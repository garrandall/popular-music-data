You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame

You've got the banjoes strummin' and plunkin' out
A tune to beat the band
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought
Dixie back to Dixieland

You make your Louis feel like the king, Mame
You make the world, we're living in swing, Mame

You make the old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention of your name
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational
I think you're just sensational, Mame

Mame
Mame

Yes, you make your Satchmo feel like a king, Mame
You make the world we're living in swing, Mame

You make the old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention of your name
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational
I think you're just sensational

Yea, sensational, you sensational, Mame
Mame, Mame, Mame
