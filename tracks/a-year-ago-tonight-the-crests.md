A year ago tonight
You were sixteen
The sweetest teenage
Queen I've ever seen

A year ago tonight
I let you know
That sixteen candles
In my heart would glow

When you made wish, kid
I was wishing too
That I'd be saying
Happy birthday
Your whole life through

Oh, yeah
A year ago tonight
I kissed you dear
And told you that
I'd be yours
Throughout the years

Now, Father Time
Has proven we were right
Woah, woah, two lovers
Born a year ago tonight
(Tonight, tonight)

When you made wish, kid
I was wishing too
That I'd be saying
Happy birthday
Your whole life through

Oh, a year ago tonight
I kissed you dear
And told you that
I'd be yours
Throughout the years

Now, Father Time
Has proven we were right
Woah, woah, two lovers
Born a year ago tonight
(Tonight, tonight)

Woah, woah, woah
Two lovers born
A year ago tonight
Yeah, yeah
Two lovers born
A year ago tonight
