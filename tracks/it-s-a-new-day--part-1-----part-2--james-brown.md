Fellas, things done got too far gone
We gotta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!
It's done gotta be a drag, man, a man can't do nothing no more!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha!
It's really a drag!
You gotta do something!
Can I  tell 'em?
Lookey here!


Girl, let me tell you what you got to do
T.C.B. so mellow, so nobody can get through
When he ask you do you love him, smile and kiss his cheek
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
Don't let nobody take care o' your business better than you do
Do what he wants, give him what he wants, respect will come to you


And than you can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can hold your man
You can hold... hey!


Never get so confident with nothin' you want to know
Cause that's the time, you lose your thing, then you got to go
You know what we got to tell 'em to be the untold boss
Use your thing so carefully and don't be a total loss
Sister, when you loved your man, be careful how you tell 'im that
He will put you back on the corner, use you like a Sunday hat


You can hold your men, you can hold your men, you can hold your men, you can
Hold, hey!

Hit it!
Good god, git it!
Hit me now!
Good god!
Never get too confident so it's nothing you want to know
Because that's the time, you lose your thing, then you got to blow
You know i got what it takes to be the untold boss
You gotta use it carefully and it can't be a total...
Hit me now!
Good god, kill it!
Yeah!
Good god!
Fellas!

Is a witness over there?

Wait a minute!
Girl, let me tell you what you got to do
Keeping me so mellow, nobody can get through
And when he had to do your loving, smiling keeps us cheek, good god
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
And make sure you keep him weak, good god
