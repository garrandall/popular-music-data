I'm standing outside your window
I've been here all night long
June feels like December
'Cuz I'm out here all alone
If you come down to the back door
I'll climb down from this tree
Baby you can grab your steps
And take a walk with me

Now that you've got me speechless
So much I wanna say
I can kiss my cool goodbye
Every time you look at me that way
I'd get down on my knees to make you understand
That you're the girl who holds the heart
Inside this man

Whoa ho! - whoa ho ho! - ohoohhoh
Now if you feel the way I do
Just say yeah yeah yeah
Whoa ho! - whoa ho ho oh! - ohoohhoh
Baby if you love me, won't you say you love me
Say yeah yeah yeah

If I could offer you heaven
Girl you know I would
I'd be your guardian angel
Baby if I could
But if I have to wait a lifetime
Girl I will do anything to show you
That I love you still

Whoa ho! - whoa ho ho! - ohoohhoh
Now if you feel the way I do
Just say yeah yeah yeah
Whoa ho! - whoa ho ho oh! - ohoohhoh
Baby if you love me, won't you say you love me
Say yeah yeah yeah

Shout it out loud
Tell your mama
Tell your daddy
Everybody hear me
Everybody here sing
Shout it out loud
Shout it out loud
Shout it out loud
Tell the world
