Sunshine, so you found my window
But you won't find me
'Cause sunshine, I've got my friend the darkness
Here to hide me

Sunshine as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
Sunshine as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me

'Cause she don't love me
She don't love me anymore
No, she doesn't want me
She doesn't want me anymore

She grew tired
Of chasing rainbows
Oh, I loved her true
God knows how I tried

But I guess she was right
I'm at the end
I've found a pot but
There's no gold inside

So sunshine can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
Sunshine pack up your dawn
And move on down the street

Sunshine as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
Sunshine as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me

'Cause she doesn't want me
She doesn't want me anymore
