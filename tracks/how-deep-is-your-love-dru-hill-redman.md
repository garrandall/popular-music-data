Yeah, whoa


Yo, yo, yo, yo
Look around brother, ha, ha
Def Jam, Def Squad
Frank Rock
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Look around brother
We keep it hot, Dru Hill
Def Squad from the top one time

Hey mami don't you know that I like it when you call me papi
But it seems like lately baby that you've been seeing another chico
And baby you know that he can't go down like me
And you know the nigga can't freak like me
So mami tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me


How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now

Ven aqui little mami
Puerto Rican I see way you wiggle it
The way you move your body
He can't make it get wetter than me
But I bet you he keep telling you he better than me
Oh you know that he can't go down like me
And you know that he ain't no freak like me
So baby tell me one little thing
How deep is you love for me




Ay Nokio venga aqui
Ay Dios mio, Ay venga aqui
Papi morenito, damelo duro
Damelo papi chulo


Yo, yo, yo, yo, buenos dias mama, creep with doctor bullshit, when I
talk my teeth should rot, I'm from the Ritz which means I'm born to dog,
you heard this, wanna a shot at it, warn them all, I hit all off from the
bathroom stall, tappin' draws and they get gas to pass, platinum cars,
Then I'm like yo, yo going to buy my crew bikes, with double pipes and we
quick to lose on the turnpike, I'm the one that turned you out, dug
it out, it was the Hennessy that made us thug it out, what you like
shit freaky, you down with it, your other man's a punk with a hand to
punk tha grunge, ride out tough, even Honey Comb hide out, duck the hour
rush, better choose quick chick, I got tracks to dust, Dru Hill, Def
Squad, if you askin' us
