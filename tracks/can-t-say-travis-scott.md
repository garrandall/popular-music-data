No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film


You gotta watch out where you rock 'cause shit get real
Drink too real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel
Gotta take a long drive up the hill
Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals
I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft
Chicago baby, she just wanna drill
The vibe's too wavy, it's too hard to kill
Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real


Uh-huh, yeah
Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Oh, yeah
Po—pop my trunk, dip—dip—dip—dip
Oh my


You can't say if I'm mad or nah
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out
What would you do if you heard I got it burning out?
I let it burn, skrrt that mark, I had to dip (I had to)
Better watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film


You must be cautious, told the lil' hoes I'm all in
Play this ballers offense, I left ol' girl, she callin'
You know I hit in the morning, oh, yeah, she yawning
I met you in the club, bitch, you know this shit mean nothing
Oh, didn't I hit your cousin? Mhm, no—no discussion
Sipping on lean, no Robitussin, oh, yeah, I know you love me
I beat it ain't no cuddling, you down bad, you suffering
I don't give a fuck how hard it get, that lil' bitch know I started this
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, get to the cash, no layup
Spend a big bag, Rodeo, some may ride for the fresh cut
Hoes come through just to touch us, I'ma tell the truth like Usher
You already know how I bust her, slang my chop from Russia


Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop—pop my trunk, dip—dip—dip—dip
Swang—swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop—pop my trunk, dip


No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on the alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high, above the rim
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film
