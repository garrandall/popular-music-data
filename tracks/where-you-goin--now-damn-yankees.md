There's a face in the mirror
And you close your eyes
Much easier to turn away
Than to take a look inside
So you're thinking it's over
Walking away
Let your little world crash and burn
Oh, what a price to pay

Didn't anybody tell you
It's not who's right or wrong?
Hold the line
Is this what's going on?

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will

There's a crack in the mirror
There's a hole in the sun
Full moon in the midnight sky
And you feel like you wanna run
So you blow out the candle
And you turn off the light
Then you stumble into darkness
Do you believe that love is blind?

Didn't anybody tell you
It's never too late to try?
Hold the line
Before you say goodbye

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will

Now I'm not talking 'bout what's good for me
And I'm not saying, how you ought to be
But if there is a message shining on through to you
Take a little piece of mind
And let your love light shine

Didn't anybody tell you
It's never too late to try?
Hold the line
Before you say goodbye

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will

Where you going now?
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about?
Where you going now?
When you get to the top of the hill
Gonna be there yes I will
Gonna be there yes I will
