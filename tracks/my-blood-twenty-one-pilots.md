When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light


And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you


Surrounded and up against a wall
I'll shred 'em all and go with you
When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat


And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah


Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run


If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah


Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run


If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin


And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah


Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
(Ohoh oohhoh
You don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
