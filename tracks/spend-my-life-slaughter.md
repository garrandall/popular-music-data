I've been livin' in this lonely world
Wishin' I could find someone to love
Hopin' someone would come from above
Change my life, yeah

Then I noticed you there
You were my angel sent from my despair
I know that you are the lady who cares
Whoa, yeah yeah

I wanna spend my life with you
Yeah yeah
I wanna spend my life with you yeah yeah
With you

I think of all of those sleepless nights
It's like the earth was standing still
You know I hardly had the will
To survive, yeah

Then I noticed you there
You were my angel sent from my despair
I know that you are the lady who cares
Whoa, yeah yeah

I wanna spend my life with you
Yeah yeah
I wanna spend my life with you, baby

My lady
Play it, Tim


Whoa yeah yeah
I wanna spend my life with you
Yeah yeah
I wanna spend my life with you, yeah yeah
Only with you, baby

I wanna spend my life with you
You know you're my little angel
I wanna spend my life with you

Oh, don't you know
I wanna spend all of my life with you, babe
'Cause you gave me all your lovin'
And baby I know its true, yeah
'Cause you're the only one for me
Baby, I'm the one for you
Baby I'm the one for you
