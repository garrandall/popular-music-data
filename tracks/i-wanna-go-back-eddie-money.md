I was listening to the radio
I heard a song, reminded me of long ago
Back then, I thought that things were never gonna change
It used to be that I never had to feel the pain
I know now that things will never be the same now


I wanna go back
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
Oh Lord


I recall hanging out on Friday night
The first slow dance
Hoping that I'll get it right
Back then, I thought I'd never ever stand alone
It used to be that a lonely heart was never shown
I know now that, that things will never be the same
No, no


I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know


You can't go back
I can't go back
I know now that things will never be the same
No, no


I said
I wanna go back
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back, yeah)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know


I wanna go back
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know


I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know


I wanna go back
And do it all over
But I can't go back, I know
I wanna go back
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
