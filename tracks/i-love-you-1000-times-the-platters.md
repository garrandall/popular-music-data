I love you, baby, 1000 times

Remember love notes
The teacher found in school
The whole class laughing
Gee, I felt just like a fool

Here comes the very funny, funny line
I had to write it a 1000 times

That I love you, love you
(Love you, I love you)
I love you, I love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you 1000 times
(Love you, I love you)
Baby, I love you, you know that I do

The love notes I treasured
Loving you was not a sin
Punishment was pleasure
Oh, I'd do it all over again

I wrote and I wrote, till my fingers got sore
I had to write just a little bit more

'Cause I love you, love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you 1000 times
(Love you, I love you)
You know I love you, you know I do

Did you read my letters
It's been on my mind?
All it said was
That I love you 1000 times

From then until this very same day
I still feel the same old way

'Cause I love you, love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you 1000 times
(Love you, I love you)
