Come on and sit over here and let me tell you a little bed time story

Pick up on me, Pick up on me, Pick up on me, Pick up on me

Rollin' into town, I'm down, for an evenin' of dancin'
A little chit-chat and lots of who's zat
And several invitin' glances (pick up on me)
Walked into the club, people were jammin' 'cause the base was thumpin'
I was standin' on the side with my home girl, Shirl
My body all set to get pumpin' (nice 'n' hard)
And another time I said my oh my, would I be hearin' these type in jeans
I guy lookin' fly said his name was Ty
He claimed to be a dancin' machine (pick up on me)
Well now on the floor his results were poor, so you see I had to take charge
I says listen up Jake, get the bone outcha back and pump it, pump it, nice 'n' hard

(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me
(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me
(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me
(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me

I said goodbye to fly guy type, 'cause his pump was more like a fizz
And bein' the dancer that I am, I felt it was my biz (pick up on me)
To find someone who wasn't shy, I guy not afraid to pump it
That's when I overheard a guy named Tom, just blowin' his own trumpet (nice 'n' hard, pump it)
He said he knew just what to do once he got out on the floor
I grabbed his hand, we danced, I'm 2 and 0, but who's keepin' score
He said how'm I livin', I said thanks be given, you're livin' but not too large
I said you're pumpin' okay but you're in no way to pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard (pick up on me)

(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me...

It should be known that Tom was good, but I wanted better
A guy who could pump it all night long in any kind of weather (pick up on me)
I was fadin' fast when the stranger asked if I would dance with him next
He said his name was Merv, Merv was a nerd, but I said, Oh what the heck (nice 'n' hard)
We started to dance and to my surprise this guy had pumpin' power (pick up on me)
We're were gettin' in to it and before I knew it we'd been pumpin' for an hour
I was drippin' sweat, my clothes soakin' wet, when a request came from my partner
He said you're doin' good but baby if you could, please pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard (pick up on me)

(Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it nice 'n' hard) Pick up on me
