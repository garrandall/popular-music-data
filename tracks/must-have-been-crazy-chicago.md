She's fine, so fine
And I think I'm going to lose my mind
So high, so high,
You know you make me want to
Scream and shout
Well, you know I'm like a fool
Who's just got to have a reason
You know that I've found mine
Must have been crazy
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy
To have done this so long
This time, it's time
Every singer's got to sing his song
So fine, it's fine
You know you make me want to
Sing along
'Cause you know I'm not a fool
Got to find a piece of heaven
You know that I found mine
Must have been crazy
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy
To have done this so long
'Cause you know I'm not a fool
Got to find a piece of heaven
You know that I found mine
Must have been crazy
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy
To have done this so long
