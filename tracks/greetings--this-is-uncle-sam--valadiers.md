Greetings, this is Uncle Sam
I want to take you to a far off land
I need you, oh, I need you
Yes, I need you to lend a helping hand

Say goodbye to all your buddies
Say hello to your new friends
'Cause you're in the Army now
Your new life has just began

I need you
Oh, I need you
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand

I can just see me now
With a rifle in my hand
I'm gonna have to say
Goodbye to my girl
And I hope, I hope she doesn't find another man
And mama, mama, while I'm away
Please, please write everyday

No, no, no!
Please Uncle Sam!
Please don't take me away!
(You're in the army now)

Goodbye, baby (so long baby)
(Goodbye baby) Goodbye, there's no time to cry
No, no, no



I don't wanna go
Come on, boy
I don't wanna go
We're gonna make a man out of you
Please don't you take me
This one training you're not gonna miss
Please don't you take me
I don't wanna go
Come on, boy
I need you
What ya mean you've never heard of KP?
Oh I need you
I don't care if it's 4 in the morning
Yes I need you
There is a right way, a wrong way
And there's my way, you'll do it my way!
So help me
Come on, boy, on the double
Get in step, boy, come on now
March, march
Your mama's a long ways off, boy
So stop your crying!
You're gonna become a man
