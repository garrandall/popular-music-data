Hard to get
Impossible to hold
Straight as an arrow
Like a burnin' fuse
In the long cold dawn
By the side of the road
A hopeless case
A perfect thing

Love is ... what you want it to be
Love is ... heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
Cause love is what I've got for you

Close my eyes
Search the stars
Cry for help
Wake up cold
You're in my system
Under my skin
Raw emotion
Please don't go

Love is ... What you want it to be
Love is ... Heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
Cause love is what I've got for you

Can't live on promises
Won't sleep with lies
Don't understand the things you say
Til I read 'em in your eyes
Gotta run on instinct, gotta go by feel
Gotta trust my senses
To know if it's for real

Love is ... what you want it to be
Love is ... heaven to the lonely
Show me what you want me to do
Cause love is what I've got for you
Love is...
