I often think of younger days
A boy, a girl and backyard play
I'd get hurt, you'd get your way
And they called it kid stuff
I know it mattered little then
The childish games you'd always win
Now the stakes are higher
And it's no longer kid stuff


Kid stuff when I was little
Was sitting in the middle
Of a cotton candy world
But now my heart is saying
This is no game we're playing
For I can see I'm losing you
To another world
I remember very well
Plan we made by a wishing well
And secret stuff we couldn't tell
Ain't that just like kid stuff
And I always thought
That you'd be mine
At least until the end of time
I wore your ring that cost a dime
Happiness is kid stuff


I'm losing you
To another world
