They make me sick
I know I feel you, that is why we got to stick together
Yep, yep, yep, know it


You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick


He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumping Islay
He was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay
Because he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he want to go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "Boo, I do not really know though"
He got closer to me it started getting deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick


You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick


In the 6 now, so hot
Got to pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I am thinking bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this?
Kind of funny, but I was not even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak his body was calling me
Just could not take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this


You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I'm feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick


Can't no no no
Oh, you make me sick
I want you and I am hating it hating it hating it
