I know we made plans to meet in Spokane
But the way I make plans you got to take it with a grain of salt
Got jammed in Alabama and I was trying to get it all of it resolved

I'm sure it seems like it's a perfect fit
But trust me man 'cause I've been up in it
And at dawn I had to crawl back home thru the quicksilver sprawl

To tell the truth if I were you
I'd rather sleep over than telecommute
'Cause when you're in the same room I think we make a much better connection

Hemingway at Cafe Select
Donna Summer in the discotheque
Once you get good you can get it wherever you are
Sloppy city in the upper deck
Tripping hard on the self neglect
Now let me hold the money 'cause he wants you to wait in the car

Sorry I'm late I got caught in a mosh
With this dude who said he used to play with Peter Tosh
But he never brought it up again once I said man I don't believe you

And I looked over this great expanse
And I saw some kid pissing on his parachute pants
In one split second I figured out that he was one of your crew

The amphetamines did what the amphetamines do
And she was chewing thru her cheek at the National Zoo
And the dress she was wearing made a nice case for natural selection

So Hold Steady at the Comfort Inn
Mick Jagger's at The Mandarin
Once you get good you can get it wherever you are
Notify the next of kin
Mariel Hemingway with perfect skin
And some creep with a camera who says he's gonna make her a star

You got to wait in the car

Once upon a time I had a meeting with a man in a mansion
He pulled a few strings just to demonstrate how it's all connected

Disseminating from a central source
Hemingway on the Ketchum porch
Once you get good you can get it wherever you are
So hit me back when it's back in style
Star 18 on the rotary dial
Now let me hold the money 'cause he wants you to wait in the car

You got to wait in the car
