Those school girl days
Of telling tales
And biting nails
Are gone

But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
Oh, it isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
"To sir, with love."

The time has come
For closing books
And long last looks
Must end

And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To sir, with love
