Yo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like, you know?
Yo, my men and my women don't forget about the deen
Sirat Al-Mustaqim
Yo, it's about a thing
If you feel real good, wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim

To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again

Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again, come again, come again, come again, come again

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three or four kids

And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men

How you gon' win when you ain't right within?
How you gon' win when you ain't right within?
How you gon' win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again, come again, come again, come again

Watch out watch out, look out look out 

Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing 

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only all about
That thing, that thing,that thing
