The night was full of dancers
Caught up in the light
On a sea of lonely faces
The ships pass in the night

The air was full of magic
The stars were in my eyes
But when we started dancing
There was only you and I

We were meant to be lovers
Candles in the night
You and me eternally
Until the end of time

We were meant to be lovers
Our flame will burn out bright
It's written in the stars
You were meant to be mine.

Well, I know we've both been here before
Love comes then it's gone
So many midnight promises
Get broken by the dawn

And Heaven knows a candle glows
Until it disappears
So while our flame is burning bright
Let's cast away our fears.

We were meant to be lovers
Candles in the night
You and me eternally
Until the end of time

We were meant to be lovers
Our flame will burn out bright
It's written in the stars
You were meant to be mine.
