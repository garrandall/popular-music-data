You played hooky from school
And you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay, yeah
Now you feel like
The whole world's pickin on you
But deep down inside you know it ain't true
You've been punished cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care
Cause you already made up your mind

You wanna run away, yeah
You're on your way
Run away child, running wild
Run away child, running wild
Better come back home
Better come back home
Where you belong
Where you belone

Roaming through the city
Going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey it's getting late, where will you sleep
Gettin kind-a hungry
You forgot to bring something to eat
Oh lost with no money, you start to cry
But remember you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin eyes
Siren screamin down, neon light is flickin
You want your mama
Ah there's nothing for you
You're frightened and confused I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
You wanna hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go
Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice
Cause you're lost and alone
But remember you make the choice

Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong
Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong

You're lost in this great big city
(Go back home where you belong)
Not one familiar face
Ain't it a pity
(Go back home where you belong)
Oh run away child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong
Mama, mama please come and see about me
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say I want my mama
You're frightened and confused
Which way will you choose
