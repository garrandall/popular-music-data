Spring's in the air
There's magic everywhere
When you're young and in love
Life seems to be
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just
Like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky
The moon at night
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love

Dreams can come true
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops
Are bound to fall
True love will conquer all
When you're, when you're
Young and in love

(When you're young and in love)

Though many teardrops
Are bound to fall
True love will conquer all
When you're
When you're
Young and in love, oh, yeah

When you're young in love
When you're young in love
When you're young in love

(Love, young and in love)
(Love, young and in love)
(Love, young and in love)
(Love, young and in love)
