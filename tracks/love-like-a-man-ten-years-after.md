You roly-poly
All over town
But you come on back to me
When things are down
Love like a man
Love all you can

Your satisfaction
Is growing less
If you come on back to me
Use my address and let you
Love like a man
Love all you can

You are the woman
You can't deny
You look so good to me, girl
You make me high



I'll tell you something
I think you know
When you flash those eyes at me
All systems go and let you
Love like a man
Love all you can
Love like a man
Love all you can
Love like a man
Love all you can...
