Hey, sister, why you all alone?
I'm standing out your window
Hey, little sister, can I come inside, dear?

I wanna show you all my love
I wanna be the only one
I know you like nobody ever, baby


Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow

You whisper secrets in my ear
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek
It's such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
They say I'll only do you wrong
We come together 'cause I understand
Just who you really are, baby


Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow
