I can't help it
If I walk like this
I can't help it
If I talk like this

I can't help it
If the sun don't shine
I'm just about to
Lose my mind

I lost my baby
I lost my baby
She left me all alone

And I can't help it
If I'm feeling bad
I can't help it
If I'm feeling sad

Please don't blame me
If I don't say much
I'm so lost without
Her gentle touch

I lost my baby
I lost my baby
She left me all alone

No, no, no
I can't take
Too much of this
I've got to have
Just one more kiss

Won't someone hear me now
I got to get that girl
Back somehow

Please don't blame me
If I start to cry
Just give me something
Soft to dry my eyes

If you ever had
A love that's real
Then you'll know
Exactly how I feel

I lost my baby
I lost my baby
She left me all alone

I'm so all alone
I lost my baby
I lost my baby
I'm all alone
I lost my baby...
