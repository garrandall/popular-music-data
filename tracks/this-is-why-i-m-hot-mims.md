This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah
This is why, This is why
This is why I'm hot, huh
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, oh
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not, Mims
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot
Now I've gotta rap
I can sell a mill
Say you nothing on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
Nigga say that we lost it
So I'mma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
'Coz niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the H
I watch you get it on the floor

And if you needed hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it e'ryday
Coppin' a Hollywood
Soon as I hit LA
I'm in that low low
I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi
People say that I'm fly
They like the way I dress
They like my attire
They love how I move crowds
From side to side
They ask me how I do it
And simply I reply

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, oh
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not, Mims
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot
Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another bitch, another drop
16 bars, 24 pop, 44 songs
Nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there driving cars
Push them off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird
I can get it chopped
Tell me what you need you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my hommie black
Meet me on the ave
I hit wash heights
We into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women
That you niggas never had
For those who say they know me
Know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between
You'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so feen
The way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot
My nigga this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, oh
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not, Mims
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot
Shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid
And I say yeah I paid a quap?
And then I hit the switch
That take away the top
So chicks around the way
They call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell 'em all about
We hit the studio
They say they like how I record
I gave you black train
And I did you wrong
So every time I see them
They tell me that's their song

They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear
So when I hit the room
The shorties stop and stare
Niggas start to hate
Rearrange their face
But little do they know
I keep them things by waist
'Side I reply
Nobody gotta die
Similar to lil wiz
'Coz I got the fire

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, oh
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not, Mims
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
