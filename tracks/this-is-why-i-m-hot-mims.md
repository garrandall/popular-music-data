Oh, was fÃ¼r eine kleine Welt
Da habt ihr euch auf die Frequenz auf der ich rappe grade eingestellt
Und der Sommer war Tech dieses Jahr
DafÃ¼r bin ich dann im Herbst auf Rap mich am A!

This is why I'm hot, This is why I'm hot
This is why, This is why, This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, This is why I'm hot
This is why, This is why, This is why I'm hot


This is why we hot, this is why we hot
This is why we hot, this is why we hot, whoa oy wuy!
Di girls dem love we so we know seh we hot
Hot inna di charts, this is why we hot
Step inna di club a champagne we a pop
Serious mi serious and a chat we a chat
Di girls dem love we cau we top certain spots
This is why, this is why, this is why we hot
Di whole a Jamaica yes dem know seh we hot
Di whole America yes dem know seh we hot
Mr. Junior Reid come a bless this a chat
Blackout Movement so One Blood family ever hot
Number one record pon di billboard spot
This is why, this is why, this is why we hot


This is why I'm hot (Hot) This is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why I'm hot (Hot) This is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
I'm hot cause I'm fly, you ain't cause you not (Not)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
I'm hot cause I'm fly, you ain't cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot


Wow wow! I got my clip to di rear of mi, punks live in fear of mi
Dudes on di block wid dem Glocks runnin scared of mi
I keep my tool near to mi, so don't just appear to mi
Neva touch my money no my money's near to mi
I'm in di club ballin in di V.I.P. booth
Shorty starrin at mi cause di kid's cute
This is why I'm hot you know it is di truth
She waan to get some lovin from a hardcore yute
So she made it very clear to mi whisper in my ear to mi
In har soft voice she seh hi in my ear to me
Chicks who neva dear to mi, bringin over beer to me
Girls throwin there underwear over here to me


This is why I'm hot (Hot) This is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why I'm hot (Hot) This is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
I'm hot cause I'm fly, you ain't cause you not (Not)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)
I'm hot cause I'm fly, you ain't cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot


Now if you take the sun and multiply it's heat
Ten times over then what you find it's me
I ain't the reason why crack turn from cocaine
I light it up then burn slow on that propane
Yes I'm a don but not the Juan from Soul Train
Teflon don I'm a boss in my own frame
I could flip it if you need it I got it for real
If you don't see it then they probably ain't got it for sale
I got the East Coast bumpin me hard
I got the West Coast bumpin me hard
The Dirty South show me love I get aired out the trunk of they car
The Midwest like homey you large
So when I pull up in the car, with the invincible roof on the coupe
And them doors swing up homey all you hear is swoosh
That's a swish, I don't miss when I'm aimin for the shot
This is why, this is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot


Oh, was fÃ¼r eine kleine Welt
Da habt ihr euch auf die Frequenz auf der ich rappe grade eingestellt
Und der Sommer war Tech dieses Jahr
DafÃ¼r bin ich dann im Herbst auf Rap mich am A!
