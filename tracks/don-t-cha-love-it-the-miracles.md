Like a honeycomb is made for honey
Like an empty pocket is made for money
I was made for you and you for me babe
Made to do what comes so naturally


 together love
We fit just like a glove
Can you  babe
Like fire atop a fire
We take each other higher and higher


Baby don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it



I'm the modern man and you're my lady
Don't you love the way we do it babe


 together love
We fit just like a glove
Can you  babe
Like fire atop a fire
We take each other higher and higher


Baby don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
Don't, don't cha love it


 together love
We fit just like a glove
Can you  babe
Like fire atop a fire
We take each other higher and higher


Baby baby don't cha love me
Baby baby don't cha love me
Love it love it
Don't, don't cha love it
Don't cha love it, love it
