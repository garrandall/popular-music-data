When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Livin' without you is drivin' me crazy
I cry like a baby
Well I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy or a puppet on a string

As I look back on a love so sweet
I cry like a baby
Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby

Today we passed on the street
And you just walked on by
My heart just fell to my feet
And like a fool
I began to cry

When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Livin' without you is drivin' me crazy
I cry like a baby
