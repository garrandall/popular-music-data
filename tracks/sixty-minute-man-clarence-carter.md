Here I am
I'm waiting on you, yeah
I hope you'll soon make it, baby
Cause you gotta be back by ten

Now don't be nervous, no
And don't be afraid
Cause I'm gonna do, baby
Everything I said

I'm gonna rap it to you soft
And I'm gonna love it to you easy
I'm a sixty minute man
Yes, I am

There'll be
Fifteen minutes of squeezing
Fifteen minutes of kissing
And fifteen mimutes of teasing
And fifteen minutes of
Something you've been missing

We gotta be careful, yeah
Cause folks done start to talk
And we don't want, no, no, no
We don't wanna get caught, no

But I wanted to see you so bad
I'll take any kind of chance
Cause I don't know
What I would do, baby
If I ever lose your romance

So come on, baby
Lemme rap it to you soft
And I'm gonna love it to you easy
I'm a sixty minute man
Yes, I am

I'm a sixty minute man, baby
I, I, I, I work in a hurry
