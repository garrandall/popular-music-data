What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again


What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again


Don't tell me what's it all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you


What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
No, no, I'll never fall in love again


I'm out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you


What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
