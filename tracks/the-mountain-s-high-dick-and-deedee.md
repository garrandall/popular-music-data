Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
The mountains high and the valley's so deep
Can't get across to the other side
Don't ya give up baby, don't you cry
Don't ya give up till I reach the other side

I was lonely baby, I couldnt sleep
The night they took you from my side

I was a lonely soul
Until you became my goal
And then I saw the spark of love
And then the stars fell from (up above, oh yeah)

I know someday we will meet again
But I don't know exactly where or when
But baby, if fate has its way
Well meet again some other day

The mountains high and the valley's so deep
Can't get across to the other side
Don't ya give up baby, don't you cry
Don't ya give up till I reach the other side

Hoo hoo hoo hoo (I know it to I tell ya)
Hoo hoo hoo hoo (I know it to I tell ya)
I know, I know hoo hoo hoo hoo

I know, I know hoo hoo hoo hoo
The valley's deep baby...
