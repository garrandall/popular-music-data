You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it


You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa


Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying


You lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa


Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Baby (baby), baby (baby)
I beg of you, please, please
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love (I need your love)
So bring it on back (So bring it on back)
Bring it on back (so bring it on back)


Bring back that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, no
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Cause it's gone, gone...
