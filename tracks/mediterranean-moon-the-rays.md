Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean moon

Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean moon

In the moon
Mediterranean moon

Took a swim in Texas flying into Ariba
Where we bopped right down to the Isle of Capri
As a sweet senorita who was cute as a peach
Like perpetual motion kept a-kissing me

In the moon
Mediterranean moon

Well the man in the moon had a front row view
Of the picollo marita and me and you
On the beach deserted in the midnight blue
Oh, how it made those Arabian nights come true

In the moon
Mediterranean moon

Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean moon

There's a moon off a brook, man in the USA
And the moon shines bright down Miami way
There's a California moon in Frisco Bay
But the moon that melts your heart away

Is the moon
Mediterranean moon

Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean
Mediterr, mediterr, mediterranean moon

In the moon
Mediterranean moon
Mediterranean moon
Mediterranean moon
