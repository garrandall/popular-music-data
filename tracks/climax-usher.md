Going nowhere fast. Weâve reached the climax.
Were together now weâre undone.
Wonât commit so we choose to run away.
Do we separate?
Donât wanna give in so we both gave up.
Canât take it back. Itâs too late.
Weâve reached the climax, climax.

I've fallen somehow, feet off the ground
Love is the cloud that keeps raining down.
Where are you now? When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast. Weâve reached the climax.
Were together now weâre undone.
Wonât commit so we choose to run away.
Do we separate?
Donât wanna give in so we both gave up.
Canât take it back. Itâs too late.
Weâve reached the climax, climax.

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love.
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at all

Going nowhere fast. Weâve reached the climax.
Were together now weâre undone.
Wonât commit so we choose to run away.
Do we separate?
Donât wanna give in so we both gave up.
Canât take it back. Itâs too late.
Weâve reached the climax, climax.

You say itâs better if we love each other separately.
I just need you one more time
I canât get what we had off my mind,
Where are you now? When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're...

Going nowhere fast. Weâve reached the climax.
Were together now weâre undone.
Wonât commit so we choose to run away.
Do we separate?
Donât wanna give in so we both gave up.
Canât take it back. Itâs too late.
Weâve reached the climax, climax.
