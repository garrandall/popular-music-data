I miss you
How I long to kiss you, baby
Without you, can't go on
Without you, baby

I got a hot wire from my baby
(From my baby)
Oh what a sweet little telegram
(From my baby)

She wrote, darling, I love you
There's no one above you
I wish you were home
(Wish you were home)
You been gone so long
Sincerely

(I miss you)
I'm a tell, y'all
(How I long to kiss you, baby)
Every, every day now

(Without you) please
(Can't go on without you, baby)
What'd she say

She wrote, love be with you
And every day, I'll miss you
I wish you were home so bad
(I wish you were home) so bad
You been gone so long, oh

(I miss you)
Sing the song children now
(How I long to kiss you, baby)

(Without you) can't make it
(Can't go on without you, baby)
Play your part right here
Come on

She wrote, baby, I love you
My heart and soul is with you
I wish you were home
(Wish you were home)
You been gone so long
Sincerely

(I miss you)
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(How I long to kiss you, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Without you)
Without you, I can't make it
(Can't go on without you, baby)
Take it just a bit higher, y'all

Look (I miss you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(How I long to kiss you, baby)
I'm gonna kiss you more and more

(Without you) baby
(Can't go on without you, baby)
Don't even have a possible chance
But I wanna say it one more
Come on

(I miss you) oh, baby
(How I long to kiss you, baby)
Every, every day, y'all

(Without you) yeah
(Can't go on without you, baby)
Just a little higher, y'all...
