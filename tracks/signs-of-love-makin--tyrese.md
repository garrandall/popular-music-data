These are the signs that are made for each other
Are you the zodiac Freak, oo-ee
I'm a Capricorn, I came here to get manish
Oh, I know it's good when you start speakin' spanish
Aries, sexually, you're full of energy
After I'm done, you still tellin' me you want me
Met a Gemini, oh what a sex drive
She wanted it from the front, back, left and the right
Baby, I will guarentee to give you everything your body's missin'

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you the zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you that zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh


Damn, how do I explain this next one
This girl right here, blew my mind
Let me explain

I met a Scorpio (Damn)
She had no limit to where she'd go (Oh, yeah)
She was so damn sexual
She said, Tyrese are you ready for me
I'll do anything to fulfill your needs
Tell me what you want, and I got you babe
Whisper in my ear while I'm driving you crazy
I'll smack it from the side
While I'm grabbing them thighs
Now I know what zodiac signs are all about

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you the zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you that zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh

Libra, Gemini, Virgo
Are you with me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pisces, Aries, Scorpio
Are you with me, say yeah yeah yeah
Sagittarius, Cancer and Taurus
I don't know what it is
But you Leos drive me crazy
Crazy, baby

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you the zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh

These are the signs of love makin'
Are you that zodiac freak I've been lookin' for
Girl, you're sending me
Signs of love makin'
And you make me say, Oh

I was talking to this girl one day
And she ask me what is your sign of love, baby
I said a Capricorn, she was impressed
Baby, what is your sign
She said a Pisces, we connected
And I think you're kinda sexy, baby
You said Carpicorn
Take my hand, I'mma take ya to lover's land
I'mma show you things
You've never seen
All night long
Baby, be my babe
