Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

You're taking too much time to make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls in your crazy mixed up world
You said you'd drop them, but you know you won't

Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cuz boy with you, I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Out of my mind, that's where I'm going
Tryin' so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy tryin' to bare these changes
Oh boy, that you're puttin' me through

In my head there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going round and round
Until I get away from you

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Out of my mind, that's where I'm going
Tryin' so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy tryin' to bare these changes
Oh boy, that you're puttin' me through

In my head there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going round and round
Until I get away from you

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles
Circles
Circles goin' round in circles
