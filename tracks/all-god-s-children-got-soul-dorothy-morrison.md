I've got a song to say
There’s such a whole lot of trouble in the world yeah
It's just a little understanding I want to bring to the scene
And I just want you to listen to me

You got to stop and search your soul
See just where you stand
Now you got to dig down deep now
To find the good you plan
Now it's not going to be easy (it’s not easy)
You gotta admit that you been wrong (it's not easy)

But let's stop and try (stop and try)
Good god, before all the hope is gone (hope is gone)
While you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by (the whole world's passing you)

You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God’s children got soul (all of god’s children got)
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god’s children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)

Remember the good old days
When there was a family day
And now my whole world is changing y'all
Aw its funny what you can bring

The family is no longer valued
And there’s fighting everywhere now
Now what's the matter with people today (what's the matter)
Nobody wants to pray (what's the matter)
Oh while you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by (the whole world's passing you)

You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)

Remember the good old days
When there was a family day
And now my whole world is changing y'all
Aw its funny what you can bring

The family is no longer valued
And there's fighting everywhere now
Now what's the matter with people today (what's the matter)
Nobody wants to pray (what's the matter)
Oh while you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by (the whole world's passing you)

You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)

Soul ain't got no color y'all
You gotta feel it (feel it)
You gotta feel it (feel it)
You gotta feel it (feel it)
Feel it (feel it)
You can't tell one from another, y'all (no no way down deep)

You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
And we got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul (all of god's children got)

Soul is what you can't hide y'all
You got to feel it
Soul is something you can't hide y'all
You got to feel it
