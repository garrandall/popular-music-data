Wanna take some time
And take you serious
Gotta take a position
The way that we've been hanging out
It should be obvious
I admit it, baby
I want you for my girlfriend

You make me nervous
You make me shout
You turn me, baby
Inside out

But most of all
I'm satisfied whenever you're around
Yet I get this feeling
That you're gonna turn me down

Can't keep this secret
Got to let you know my heart
You've been my weakness
I've been loving you right from the start

I want you, baby
I want you for my girlfriend
(I want you for my girlfriend)

All the fellas seem to think
That you're my number one
I can't stop what they're thinking

But the truth is that
We're really only having fun
Honestly, I want to be your boyfriend

Well, you make me nervous
You make me shout
You turn me, baby
Inside out

But most of all
I'm satisfied whenever you're around
Yet I get this feeling
That you're gonna turn me down

Can't keep this secret
Got to let you know my heart
You've been my weakness
I've been loving you right from the start

I want you, baby
I want you for my girlfriend
I want you, baby
Baby, won't you be my girlfriend?

Girlfriend
Girlfriend

I want you, baby
I want you for my girlfriend
Please be mine
I want you, baby
Baby, won't you be my girlfriend?

I want you, baby
I want you for my girlfriend
I want you, baby
Baby, won't you be my girlfriend?

Cause I love you and I need you
And, girl
I got to have you, baby
(Girlfriend)
Listen up, ha

I want you, baby
(Be my girl
Be my baby)
I want you for my girlfriend
Be my
(Girlfriend)
Be my baby
