Out of all of the places in this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't too red
Since we been over, been trying like crazy to get you out of my head


So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

I wish you had on sunglasses to cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean to make me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do



Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough



Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Out of all of the places
In this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down
