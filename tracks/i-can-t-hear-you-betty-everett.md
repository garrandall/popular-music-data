Here you are again
Telling me you're sorry, baby
Telling me you wanna come home
Back home where you belong

There you again
Lying and alibiing
Singing that same old
Worn out song
Here it comes now

Hey, hey (I'm sorry, baby)
I can't hear you no more
(I'm sorry, baby)
Well, I've heard it all before
(I'm sorry, baby)

You ain't reaching me
No how, no way
No time til doomsday
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more

You walked out on me
Once too often now
And I can't take no more
Of your jiving, that's the truth

I ain't about to let you
Run me into the ground
This girl ain't throwing away
Her youth, not hardly

(I'm sorry, baby)
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
I can't hear you no more
(I'm sorry, baby)
Well, I've heard it all before
(I'm sorry, baby)

You ain't reaching me
No how, no way
No time til doomsday
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more

(I'm sorry, baby)
(I'm sorry, baby, hey)

You ain't reaching me
No how, no way
No time til doomsday
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more

You gotta speak up louder
(I'm sorry, baby)
You gotta speak up louder
A little bit louder
(I'm sorry, baby)
A little bit louder

Just a little bit louder
(I'm sorry, baby)
A little but louder
Speak up louder
(I'm sorry, baby)
A little bit louder...
