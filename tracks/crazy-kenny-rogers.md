Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me

I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
This is where I'll always be
I will always need your love

Now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
Though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever

I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
This is where I'll always be
And I need you with me
'cause you are the dream
That finally came true for me
And all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life there could be no one else
And for the rest of my life all I need is you

I guess I'm crazy
