Lotta dope
Gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Ba-da-ba-da-beee
Ba-ba-da-bope
Yeah
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta coke
We got weed, thatâs a lotta smoke
Yeah, thatâs that loud I hope
We gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope, yea we gotta lotta coke
We got weed, thereâs a lotta smoke
Yea, thatâs that lotta dope
I said we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Okay we gotta lotta dope
We got the hotter hoes
I said we done shot a lot of folk
We be in and out of court
And I done seen so many cowards croak
Itâs like watching flowers grow
I mean, please, don't you cowards know?
We will leave your bloody body on your mamaâs porch
Lord, born in the projects
Papa was a rolling stone, selling rock crack
Yeah, I grew up in my day
Making juugs on a phone with no contacts
I'm drinking Activas only know Hi-Tech
Hold on, think I'm getting too high tech
Yeah, I think she getting a contact
Now she needs some dope dick, and she know who to contact


Ba-da-ba-da-beee
Ba-ba-da-bope
Yeah
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta coke
We got weed, thatâs a lotta smoke
Yeah, thatâs that loud I hope
We gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Yo Tunes, pass the steel, or bash the steel
My passion real, I'm fashion ill
The pussy niggas are Massingil, mass appeal
My past is real before I had the deal, you dig?
Pies and cakes, out of state
Lies is fake, God donât make mistakes
Got the girl pussy smelling like Codeine Syrup
Got the bands on me like a football field, I'm ill
I deserve a threesome for my birthday
If she pretty it's Magic City on the first date
Cup of lean and toast, yeah Iâm âposed to boast
Goody Mo the quote, not many coming close
Trying to smoke what I never smoked before
Dream what I never dreamed before
Woke up and my Rolls sky high
I ride by, I drive by then hop out


Ba-da-ba-da-beee
Ba-ba-da-bope
Yeah
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta coke
We got weed, thatâs a lot of smoke
Yeah, thatâs that loud I hope
We gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Big dreams, big rings, big chains
Switch lanes, sip lean
Sixteen, seventeen, Medellin
Favorite color money green
A triple beam, a hundred Ps of sour Ds
A bunch of Ds, she can come suck on these, no suckas please
See I look like my daddy though
I get high, I get the munchies eating edible
If itâs available
Bitch you never know
Oyster Perpetual
Trapped at the Texaco like Iâm OJ
Trying to put it in her mouth like Colgate
Ben Franklin, thatâs my muthafuckin soul mate
Yea I need a mop, I got a new floâ today
Iâm sippinâ syrup like a got a fuckinâ cold today
Iâm throwing tres up like Golden State
Old school the same color as Sidney Poitier


Ba-da-ba-da-beee
Ba-ba-da-bope
(Got a lot, got a lot)
Yeah
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope
(Got a lot, got a lot) We gotta lotta coke
We got weed, thatâs a lotta smoke
Yeah, thatâs that loud I hope
We gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope
