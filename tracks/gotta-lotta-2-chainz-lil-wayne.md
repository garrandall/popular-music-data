Lotta dope
Gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Da-ba-da-ba-deee, da-ba-da-bope
Ba-ba-da-bope
We gotta lotta dope
We gotta lotta coke
We got weed, that's a lotta smoke
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope
And we gotta lotta dope
Ba-ba-da-bope


Okay, we gotta lotta dope (yeah)
Yeah, we got the hotter hoes
I said we done shot a lot of folk (bow)
We be in and out of court
And I done seen so many cowards croak
It’s like, watching flowers grow
I mean please, don't you cowards know
We will leave your bloody body on your mama’s porch?
Lord, born in the projects
Papa was a rolling stone, selling rock crack
Yeah, I grew up in my day
Making juugs on a phone with no contacts
I'm drinking Actavis only, no Hi-Tech
Hold on, think I'm getting too high tech
Yeah, I think she getting a contact
Now she needs some dope dick and she know who to contact


Da-ba-da-ba-deee, da-ba-da-bope
Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope
We gotta lotta coke
We got weed, that’s a lotta smoke
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope
I said we gotta lotta dope
Yeah, ba-ba-da-bope


Yo Tunes, pass the steel or bash the steel
My passion real, I'm fashion ill
The pussy niggas are Massengil, mass appeal
My past is real before I had the deal, you dig?
Pies and cakes, out of state
Lies is fake, God don’t make mistakes
Got the girl pussy smelling like codeine syrup
Got the bands on me like a football field, I'm ill
I deserve a threesome for my birthday
If she pretty it's Magic City on the first date
Cup of lean and toast, yeah I’m 'posed to boast
Goodie Mo the quote, not many coming close
Trying to smoke what I never smoked before
Dream what I never dreamed before
Woke up and see my Rolls sky high, I ride by
I drive by, then hop out


Da-ba-da-ba-deee, da-ba-da-bope
Yeah, ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope
Yeah, we gotta lotta coke
We got weed, that’s a lot of smoke
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope
I said we gotta lotta dope
Yeah, ba-ba-da-bope


Da-ba-da-ba-deee, da-ba-da-bope
(Gotta lot, gotta lot) Ba-ba-da-bope
I said we gotta lotta dope
(Got a lot, got a lot) Yeah, she snort a lotta coke
We got weed, that’s a lotta smoke
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope
I said we gotta lotta dope
(Yeah) Ba-ba-da-bope
