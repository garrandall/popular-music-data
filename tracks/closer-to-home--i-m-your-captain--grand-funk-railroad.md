Everybody listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
I've been lost now, days uncounted
And it's months since I've seen home
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Or am I all alone?

If you return me to my home port
I will kiss you mother earth
Take me back now, take me back now
To the port of my birth

Am I in my cabin dreaming, or are you really scheming
To take my ship away from me?
You'd better think about it, I just can't live without it
So, please don't take my ship from me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can feel the hand of a stranger
And its tightening around my throat
Heaven help me, heaven help me
Take this stranger from my boat
I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
Everybody listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
Ohhhh

I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
