Sometimes I get my head in a dilly
Feeling so lost, ticking you off
Now boy you know me well, said I'm that kind of philly
That kind of soft, that kind of silly


But when I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like


Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon


High in the sky, the song that I'm singing (That I'm singing)
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry
Rabbit out the hat, yes, that's what I'm bringing
(That's what I'm bringing)
Tricks up my sleeve for noticing me (Oh yeah)


Wouldn't cause you any harm (Oh)
I just want you in my arms
I can't help
I can't help myself


Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
(There's a shark in the water)
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
Better be soon


Right is right, rules are rules
This is more like April Fools, just winding you up, whoa
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Please don't make too much of it
It ain't that serious, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yes


Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
(Baby, there's a shark in the water)
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
I caught them barking at the moon
You better get here soon


Baby, there's a shark in the water (There's a shark in the water)
Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
Baby, there's a shark in the water (Water)
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
