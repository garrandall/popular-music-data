Yea
You a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, ugh
(Big Sean) Boi, Do It
Let's go


Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time (yeah)
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay


Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Yeah


She love the way I'm doin' it
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?)
My bitch
Hold up, hol' up, woah there
Let's capture this moment if I hit it then I own it
Marijuanin every mornin'
And Patronin', girl, we groanin'
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on, on?
Cause' ya know I got it goin' til' it's...


Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay


Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Talk to the, talk to the,.. hand
Bitch, you talkin' to a grown ass man
It's, like way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Err'ybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem


Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay


I don't really wanna uhh... talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half asian
And we 'bout to have a liason
She's so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it's just so amazing
So amazin'
So amazin'


Take it to the car, (bloop, bloop), that shit look like I'm speed racin'
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation
Westside is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it til it's...


Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay.
