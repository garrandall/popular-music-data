It's been so long
Since I touched a lady
And I'm still waiting
For you to come back to me

Now will you forgive me
For the wrong I've done?
And let's try again
To make it last so long


I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life we're dreaming of

So don't wait
Another day might be too long
Don`t rush
Go slow
So nothing goes wrong


Listen, baby
I can't wait to feel your love again
Cause you can stop this pain
That I've been feeling

So let's start all over
And put the past behind
And make a love to stand
To the test of time


I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life, yeah
We`re dreaming of

And these feelings
Are so very strong
Another day might be too long
Go slow
So nothing goes wrong

I just can`t take it no more, baby
The feel of your warm embrace, baby
I`m still waiting on you

I`m still waiting
For you to come back to love
(Ohhh, yes, I am)
To fulfill this life
(That we`re dreaming of)
We`re dreaming of

So baby
Please don't wait
Baby, baby
Another day might be too long
(My arms are open wide)
Go slow
So nothing goes wrong


Sometimes I get so lonely
Wanna call you, baby
Just a little love is all I need
Yeahhh
Another day might be too long
Go slow
So nothing goes wrong

Just a little love is all I need
(My arms are open wide)
Just a little love is all I need
Yeah
Whoa, oh
The feel of your warm embrace

I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life
We`re dreaming of

I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life
We`re dreaming of
So don't wait
Another day might be too long
Don`t rush
Go slow
So nothing goes wrong
