Who looks at her life
In the palm of her hand
Rain's on the roof
There's tears in the land
Of heartbreak
She's made up her mind
She won't turn back again
She writes a note
But words just won't say
Turns off the TV
Pulls down the shade
She's leaving
No, she won't change her mind
To leave it all behind

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

Who's playin' cards
From midnight 'til dawn
Lives in a wasteland
Yesterday's gone
Forever
He's made up his mind
To leave it all behind
So he says to himself
As he folds up his hand
Who of my friends will understand were
I'm goin'
To find my own way
I won't turn back again

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

I have a dream that I hold in my heart
And I won't let go
Welcome tomorrow - I'm on my way
So goodbye yesterday
Goodbye yesterday

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another...
