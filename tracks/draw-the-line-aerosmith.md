Checkmate honey, beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey, I'm livin' on a astral plane
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind
When to draw the line

A Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right outa me
Oh, pass me the vial and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line

Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line

Checkmate, don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice, the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line
