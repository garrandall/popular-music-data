Here we go
My big ego is gonna get me in trouble
Trying to play hero
My jeans can't tight like Michael Phelps speedo
We no play follow fashion, when we lead out
Now looky here, my big ideas
Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers
But have no fear, no bother cry tears
You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years

(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage

(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh

(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

Me do a thousand video shooting, ten thousand chariot
Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop
Mi deejay til' me hoarse a welcome people to the rock
You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks
I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact
Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract
Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot
Big Gong to the Zilla and the return of the mac
