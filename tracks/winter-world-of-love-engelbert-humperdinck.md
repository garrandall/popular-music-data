My love, the days are colder.
So, let me take your hand 
And lead you through a snow white land.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

My love, the year is older.
So, let me hold you tight
And while away this winter night.
Oh, oh.

I see the firelight in your eyes.
Come kiss me now, before it dies.
We'll find a winter world of love,
'Cause love is warmer in December.
My darlin', stay here in my arms
Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love,
You'll see, we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground,
We found our winter world of love.

Because the nights are longer,
We'll have the time to say such tender things
Before each day.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

And then, when love is stronger,
Perhaps, you'll give your heart
And promise me we'll never part, oh, no.

And at the end of every year,
I'll be so glad to have you near.
We'll find a winter world of love,
For love is warmer in December.
My darlin', stay here in my arms
Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love,
You'll see, we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground,
We found our winter world of love.
