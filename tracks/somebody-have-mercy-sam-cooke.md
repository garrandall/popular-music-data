Somebody have mercy
And tell me what is wrong with me
Somebody have mercy
And tell me what is wrong with me
Sometimes I don't know how I stand
The things this woman do to me
Let me tell you


When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think I've got her chained down
She starts acting up again
But oh, let me tell you


I'm going down to the bus station
With a suitcase in my hand, yes, I am
I'm going down to the bus station
With a suitcase in my hand, yes, I am
I'm gonna grab me an armful of Greyhound
And ride just as far as I can
And blow that thing for me now


Yeah, mmm
And yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, now
Mmmhmm, hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yay, yeah
Let me tell you one more time


Somebody have mercy
I wonder what is wrong with me, Lord have mercy
Somebody have mercy
I wonder what is wrong with me, yeah
Sometimes I don't know how I stand
The things this woman do to me
Blow that one more time while I tell 'em


I'm standing here wondering, baby
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? Yes, I am
Standing, wondering, baby
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? Yes, I am
Oh I got a long way to get there
And I got a short time to go


One more time
Oh, oh, oh, hmm, hmm
