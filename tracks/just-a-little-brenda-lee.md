My life was filled with sin ThenJesus took me in
And then a little light from Heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and he will answer by and by
When you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You will know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Oh I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
He is the one who watches day and night
Oh, I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Have a little talk with Jesus
Tell Him all about our troubles
Hear our faintest cry and we will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
Know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
