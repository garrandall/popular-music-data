Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Get it on, get it on

Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Rock me all night long

Oh, don't waste a minute
Don't waste no time
Give right to it
Come on and be mine

Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Get it on, get it on

Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Rock me all night long

Oh, come on and take me
Make me feel good
Wrap your arms around me
You're what I want

Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Get it on, get it on

Wrap your arms around me
Come on, come on
Wrap your arms around me
Rock me all night long

Do it, do it now, do it, do it now
Do it, do it now, baby
Do it, do it now, do it, do it now
Do it, do it now, baby

Do it, do it now, do it, do it now
Do it, do it now, baby
Do it, do it now, do it, do it now
Do it, do it now, baby

Do it, do it now
Do it, do it now
Do it, do it now
