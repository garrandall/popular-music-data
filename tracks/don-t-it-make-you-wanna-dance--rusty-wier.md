I've been gone for so long
It's sure good to get back home
Back to the familiar faces smiling right back at me
There's a rainbow in the sky
A certain twinkle in their eye
They believe in what I am and what I want to be


Now don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country
Pick and sing a while


Oh Lord, it feels so right
Just a-sittin' by the campfire light
Trading tunes coming right back again
You look around as you pick your song
Everybody's grinnin' and playin' along
And when that chorus rolls around everybody joins in


Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country
Pick and sing a while
Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country
Pick and sing a while


Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country
Pick and sing a while
Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down down down in the country
Pick and sing a while
Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down down down in the country
Pick and sing a while


When you're down down down in the country
Pick and sing a while
When you're down down down in the country
Pick and sing a while
When you're down down down in the country
Pick and sing a while
