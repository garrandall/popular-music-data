Woah
You guys wan' go to the beach with few freaks, huh? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Totally (Ayy, swiffer surfin', damn)
We rock (Surfin', oh) (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Woah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the wave (Surfin') (Yeah, yeah)
It's big wave (Woo) (Yeah, yeah)

Surf, surf (Yeah), surf, surf (Totally)
Surf, surf, surf, surfin' (Woah)
Surf, surf (Yeah), surf, surf
Surf (Totally, dude), surf, surf, surfin' (Woo)

These niggas gon' ride the wave (Wave)
Your ass is just like a tank (Yeah)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (Wave)
I'm 'bout to go fill up a safe (Totally)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (You ride)
These niggas gon' copy for days (Go, go)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (The wave)
They tryna find out where I stay (Totally)

I had a lock with a latch to see who break in
It just was a test, ah
Virgil been sending me drip
Just to see if I like it or rockin' with it
There go lil' mama, I don't wanna fuck
'Cause she burnin', she trippin' (Woah)

I'm wavy, goddamn, niggas want smoke with the slatt
We can meet in the kitchen (Woah)
I'm burnin' the ham, these so-called gangsters
Don't know how to approach the man (Totally)
I chop up his ass, I chop up his friends
His mamas, and all his six kids (Woah)

I come with that lead
I chop off the top of the Benz and all it gets fierce
They can't wait to shred
I told 'em to chop off your penis
You keeping your head (Chop, I told 'em to do it)

I had a drum with a 'K and it's fully loaded
Nigga play in this bitch (Woah, woah)
Catch him down bad
You know I'm puttin' dick in your wife
I'm not sparing shit (Woah, woah, woah)

Shawty pussy so tight
I had to finger her shit with a stick (Totally)
Niggas ain't come from my tribe
I can barely say they hit (Totally)
I need some brand new tires
I done burned off of the Z06 (Skrrt, skrrt)

I know 'bout family ties
I know 'bout the mob, but can't say shit (Shh, shh)
Couple things I done seen in the dark, I know I gotta die with it
Couple mains, I done sent a couple on the Spain
A couple on French (I totally do)

Surf (Woah), surf (Woah), surf (Woah), surf (Woo)
Surf, surf, surf (Totally, dude), surfin' (Woah)
Surf, surf (Yeah), surf, surf (Rock)
Surf, surf (Woah), surf (Woah), surfin' (Wavy)

They tryna ride the wave
Nine times out of ten, these niggas gon' drown (Drown)
We got some slimy ways
Can call up the bro, wipe his nose for a pound (Slatt)
I count it up, see what I made today
Beat it up, you gotta pay to play (Beat it up)
Underdog, I gotta name to save
Some niggas won't ever get out (No, surf)

I'm having major waves (Surf)
Drip like I made the rain (Surf)
Scared and I'm gripping the grain (Surf)
All of this dripping, ain't drain (Surf)
I copped a Bentley Mulsanne
The money been healin' the pain (Yeah)
The coupe the same color cocaine
I hope you don't sniff anything (Yeah)

She say she like giving me brain
I hope you didn't get her a ring (Ring)
In the Clearport, I'm boarding the plane
G6 is known for a king
Overseas, I got plenty of tings
All pretty foreign tings (Foreign tings)
Yves Saint Laurent jeans (Yeah)
I drop a four in a cream

Surf, surf, surf, surf
Surf, surf, surf, surfin' (Woah)
Surf, surf (Yeah), surf, surf (Rock)
Surf, surf (Woah), surf (Woah), surfin' (Wavy)

These niggas gon' ride the wave (Yeah)
Your ass is just like a tank (Hey)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (The wave)
I'm 'bout to go fill up a safe (Totally, dude)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (The wave)
These niggas gon' copy for days (Totally, dude)
These niggas gon' ride the wave (Wave)
They tryna find out where I stay (Woah)
