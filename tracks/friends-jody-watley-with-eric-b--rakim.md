Friends, friends, friends
Friends, friends, friends
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool?
Did they steal your lover or was it money?
Or was it lies they told?

Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again 'cause now you know

That friends will let you down, that friends won't be around
That friends will let you down, friends won't be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Oh friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' 'bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind, never know what's on their mind
Could be true deception
Jealousy and envy reign they never want to see you get ahead
They just hold you back

Friends will let you down, friends won't be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Oh, friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' 'bout your friends

Friends are hard to find, don't be scared
Friends are hard to find
Friends are hard to find
Friends are hard to find, don't be scared
What happened to the kisses and ride, how are you?

You used to me kiss me, tell me you missed me
But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses and ride, how are you?

Forgot about the times when I rhymed, when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm but now it's rainin'

Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end? Is it better
To forget or remember? Your body's tender
The vibe that I send her, makes her surrender

The feelings of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Friends will let you down, friends won't be around
When you need them most, where are your friends?
Yeah, friends are hard to find, friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' 'bout your friends

They say they'll be with you through all times of thick and thin
A shoulder to rely on, on the days that life gets rough
There to wipe your tears away from that new heart break
But when it happens, you can't find them, where are your friends?

Friends, friends, friends
Friends, friends, friends
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Are you ready?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Are you ready?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Are you ready?

Friends are hard to find, so be careful
You could find an inch or mile if I pay you
Some ain't that bad, but one might back stab
To get their fingertips on what one might have

Bite the hand that feeds you, leave the people who need you
For those who hold you back and mislead you
So be a leader, don't get lead on unleaded
The wrong direction, a dead end's next then

You need a detour, life's like a seesaw
Ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times we need a hand to fight this

Way of life, straighten up, take the door to the placid
And don't you act two-faced
'Cause jealousy and envy and you still act friendly
You could find the end when pretend to be

Friends
Friends
Friends
...
