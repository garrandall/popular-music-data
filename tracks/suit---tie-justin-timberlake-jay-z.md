I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things, a few things, a few things, little baby?

'Cause I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Check it
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Check it
Let me show you a few things


Wait a minute. You ready, JT?


I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow burned myself, but just had to touch it
But it's so fine and it's all mine

Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching, ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight


And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love


Stop, let me get a good look at it
Oh, so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And aw, shit's so sick, got a hit and picked up a habit
But that's alright, 'cause you're all mine

Aw, go on and show 'em who you call "daddy"
I guess they're just mad 'cause, girl, they wish they had it
Oh, my killer, my thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight


And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love

Get out your seat, Hov


All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show

Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant
My rant disturbing the guests

Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some make-up sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason

All Saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!

No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles
ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you

Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh, uh!


And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey
