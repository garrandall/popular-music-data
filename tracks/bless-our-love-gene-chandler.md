God bless our love
(God bless our love)

And God forgive us
Our temptations
He knows that we have
Been tempted beyond
And above humiliation
(God bless our love)

Will he be by our side
When we need a guide
And as he blessed
The stars above
Oh, God bless our love

When our emotions
Are playing games
And we don't know
Right from wrong

As we began feeling ashamed
We'll get down on
Our knees and pray
And thank God every day
For showing us the
Right way to love and believe

That he'll be by our side
And as he's blessed
The stars above
Oh, God bless our love

(God bless our love)
God bless our love
(God bless our love)
God bless our love
(God bless our love)
God bless our love
