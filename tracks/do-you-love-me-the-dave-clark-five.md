You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down

Do you love me?
(I can really move, )
Do you love me?
(I'm in the groove.)
Now do you love me?
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)
Watch me, now
(Work, work)
Ah, work it out baby
(work, work)
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
(work, work)
With just a little bit of soul, now
(work!)
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?
Tell me
(Tell me, )
Tell me

Do you love me?
(I can really move, )
Do you love me?
(I'm in the groove.)
Now do you love me?
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)
Watch me, now
(Work, work)
Ah, work it out baby
(work, work)
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
(work, work)
With just a little bit of soul, now
(work!)
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?
Tell me
(Tell me, )
