Stop me on the corner
I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go with it
Don't you blink you might miss it
See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars
Falling from the sky
Shining how we want
Brighter than the sun

I've never seen it
But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe, I'm gonna treat it
Better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

Read it
It's signed and delivered let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars
Falling from the sky
Shining how we want
Brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika a shine down
Even when the, when the light's out
But I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters
Got me happy-ever-after
Never felt this way before
Ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

Oh, this is how it starts (this is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars
Falling from the sky
(falling from the sky)
Shining how we want
Brighter than the sun

Oh, this is how it starts (this is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars
Falling from the sky
Shining how we want
(shining how we want)
Brighter than the sun

Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun

Oh, this is how it starts
Lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
Brighter than the sun
