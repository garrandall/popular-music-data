You always say you like my style.
You say I'm tough and kind of wild.
Am I too much for you to tame?
I swear this time it's not a game.

I've known a lot of girls.
No, this I won't deny.
I'll give our love,
I'll give it more than a try.

That was then, (that was then) this is now.
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.
That was then, this is now

I've led a thousand lives it seems.
There's been a lot of broken dreams.
My mind has just swept love aside.
But you broke me down and put me wise.

I've doubted all compassion,
But you showed me the door.
I can't doubt it,
I don't doubt it no more.

That was then, (that was then) this is now.
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.
But that was then and this is now.

I've known a lot of girls.
No, this I won't deny.
I'll give our love,
I'll give it more than a try.

That was then, (that was then) this is now.
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.
That was then, this is now.

That was then, this is now.
That was then, this is now.
