You niggas gon' end up in a hearse (Hearse)
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt (Dirt)
From the trenches had to make it work (Work)
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse (Worse)
Arm, arm, arm
Hoe that's a enemy arms (Arms)
Hoe that's a enemy arms (Arms)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Hoe that's a enemy's arms (Arms)
Hoe that's a enemy's arms (Arms)

I wish the enemy harm (Harm)
Huh, bitch I'm a star (Star)
Foreign lil' whip and I'm whippin' this car (Car)
I might just park in the yard (Yard)
Catch the hoes like and I rip em apart
Fuck it, I got her heart (Heart)
Show no emotions I live in the dark (Dark)
I don't know why but that bitch left me scarred (Scarred)
I don't know why you just said play your part (Part)
Now you focus on wishing me harm
Fuck it, right to bear arms
I keep that stick on me, arms

Under the enemy arms
I cannot fold under enemy arms
Under the enemy arms
Under the enemy arms

You niggas gon' end up in a hearse (Hearse)
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt (In the fucking dirt, dirt)
From the trenches had to make it work (Work)
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse (Worse)

War, I'm in this bitch with the gang
I'm in this bitch with the gang, aye
I'm in this bih with the gang
30 we gon' let it bang
Chopper we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
Chopper we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
War, I'm in this bitch with the gang
I'm in this bitch with the gang, aye
I'm in this bih with the gang
30 we gon' let it bang
Chopper we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
Chopper we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad

You niggas gon' end up in a hearse (Hearse)
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt (Dirt)
From the trenches had to make it work (Work)
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse (worse)
Arm, arm, arm
Hoe that's a enemy arms (Arms)
Hoe that's a enemy arms (Arms)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Tear down an enemy's army (Army)
Hoe that's a enemy's arms (Arms)
Hoe that's a enemy's arms (Arms)
