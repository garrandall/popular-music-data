Have I got the right to call myself a man
Or will I go livin' up to my name again?
When I get the chance to love I let it pass
It's not the first I lost and it won't be the last

'Cause I'm a
(Loser)
With a broken heart
(Loser)
Tearin' me apart
(Loser)
And the loser is my name

When I use my heart just like a stepping stone
And when it's torn apart I feel so all alone
Feelin' sorry for myself is all I do
Things don't ever turn out like I want 'em to

'Cause I'm a
(Loser)
With a broken heart
(Loser)
Tearin' me apart
(Loser)
And the loser is my name

I'm not asking much from love
Not expecting much from love
If just once I could win
I could fall in love again

In the end I know that I will always choose
I have only one direction I can choose
Stay and let me treat her like the fool I am
Have I got the right to call myself a man?

'Cause I'm a
(Loser)
With a broken heart
(Loser)
Tearin' me apart
(Loser)

'Cause I'm a
(Loser)
With a broken heart
(Loser)
Tearin' me apart
(Loser)

'Cause I'm a
(Loser)
With a broken heart
(Loser)
Tearin' me apart
(Loser)
