I'm looking fa Mrs. Bubble Gum
I'm Mr. Chik-O-Stick

'Cause you so thick
Girls call me Jolly Rancher (Oh)
'Cause I stay so hard
You can suck me for a long time
(Oh my god!)
Girl this ain't no dance floor
This a candy sto'
And I'm really geeked up
And I got more dro
I pop, I roll
It's soft I know
It's the summer time
But your laffy taffy got me froze (oh)
Gone get loose (oh)
Gone get low (oh)
Don't be shy
Hoe I'm Faybo? (oh)
I know you wanna ride
You're a star and it shows
(What's happening? What's up? What's up? Let's go, let's go, let's go)

Girl shake that laffy taffy

Cum on trick, cum on trick
Here go Mr. Chocolate
I like the way you break it down
Waddle, stop you watching me
Laffy taffy I'm likin' this
Big old ass you shaking bitch
Close your mouth and don't say shit
Bend on over and hit a split
Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, your ankles swell
Girl let me touch you
I will never tell
Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that hoe
All the money just hit the floor
D4L I'm ready to go
Hoe can't even shake no more
They tired out
Let's ride out
Bitch you wanna go
Then she can go
She get in my car
I ain't playing no more
Start moving on my Faybo

Say baby girl
A what you gonna do
I got a hundred ones
I wanna pour on you
Just keep that ass shaking
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a player
And sip that grey goose
Feelin' all loose
'Cause girl you're on your job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On the stilettos
You made it skeet skeet skeet
Like a water hose (candy girl)
Got me goin' in my pocket
Pullin' out more dough
Let the waitress know I need to order
Five hundred more
You best believe later on we headed 2 the more
So gone and pack them bags
And let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on your fine ass
At the front door
Girl you don't know
I'm gonna toss the laffy taffy
Toss it flip it and slap it
Bust a couple of nuts
And get right back at it

Girl shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
Girl shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
That laffy taffy (candy girl)
That laffy taffy
Girl shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
Girl shake that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy
That laffy taffy (candy girl)
That laffy taffy
