Hard to determine
What's wrong and what's right
Hard for me to determine
How I should live my life
You don't understand
I'm only a man
And I'm going to do what a man will do

You've become a wife to me
You've become a way of life to me
Let this be a letter to my baby
Let this be a letter to my baby

I respect you baby
More than you'll ever know
But my time my time is never my own
You you won't let me breathe
Either I'd die of suffocation
Or turn around and leave

You've become a wife to me
And you've become a way of life to me
Let this be a letter to my baby. (let it be let it be let it be a letter to my baby)
Let this be a letter to my baby. (oh yeah oh)
Let this be a letter to my baby. (let it be let it be let it be a letter to my baby)
Let this be a letter to my baby
