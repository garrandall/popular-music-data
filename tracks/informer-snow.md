What's up man, hey yo what's up

Sick and tired of 5-0 running up on the block here

Word, word, bust it!

Police-a them-a they come and-a they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So they put me in the back the car at the station
From that point on I reach my destination
Well the destination reached on the East Detention
Where they looked down my pants and looked up my bottom so

Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station, black up my hands
Trail me down 'cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do, I'm backed and I'm trapped
Slap me in my face, took all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer
