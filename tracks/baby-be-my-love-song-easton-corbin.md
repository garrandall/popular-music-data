So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playing, everyone went home
But the stars are still out and you're so damn hot
And I ain't ready for the music to stop


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song


Girl, fast or slow, three-quarter time
It don't have to make sense and it don't have to rhyme
As long as it's you babe, I'm all in
And when it's over, just play it again


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song


Baby, be my melody
My little feel good that gets to me
Don't be shy baby, set it free
Crank it up, hit me way down deep


Baby, be my love song
Baby, be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rocking 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along coming on
Baby be my love song
Baby be my love song
Oh yeah
Be my love song
(Be my love song)
