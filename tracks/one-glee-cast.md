Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You've got someone to blame


You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without


Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One (Yeah, yeah!)
One (Ohh!)


Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?


Oh, well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I've got
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to hurt each other
Now we do it again

You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt


One love (One love), one blood (One blood)
One life, you got to do what you should
One life (One life) with each other (Each other)
Sisters (Sisters), and my brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One...
One... (One!)
One... (One life, oh yeah)
One...
