I said oh sweet baby lips are for kissing
I'm going crazy thinking what I'm missing, oh babe
Right about now, yeah
I sit down closer just flesh and eat now
Your smile's electric, your lips look sweet enough to eat

Oh baby, just put your mouth on me

Are you worthy of such a big reaction?
Now Mr. Murphy you need some satisfaction and loving
Yes it does right about now
You look tired rest your head on me
It's so hard babe, it's so hard for you to see, yeah

Just put your mouth on me
Just put your mouth on me

I see you watching me
My this ain't no fantasy
I know that's you are what I need
Put your mouth, put your mouth on me
I'm gonna rest while you listen to the band

Girl you taught me with your fingertips now
See if you want me, you got to say it with your lips
Oh, babe, just say it with your lips
Woman I'm not filled with a mean love
If I didn't love you would I let you do this thing?

Just put your mouth, just put your mouth
Just put your mouth on me
Just put your mouth on me
I'm going up and down all around
Gonna head down to the ground
Just put your mouth on me
Heh! Heh! Heh!
