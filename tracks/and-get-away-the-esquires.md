Wait
Got to get away
Pick your feeet up just a little higher
Move your legs from side to side
Clap your hands a little louder
You can shinga ling
And sock sock sock it to me
So hear what I sat
And get on up and get away
Girl let me help you do the pearl
Got to keep on pushin
Got to get through to you
Girl you make me so happy
Just as long as I can see you
Get on up and get away
Sock sock sock it to me
Da da ow
Get on up get on up and get away
Clap your hands
Just a little louder
Stomp your feet
Just a little louder
Come on every body and feel the beat
Come on every body
You're doing it real neat
So come on
Get on up and get away
Girl
Get on up and get away
