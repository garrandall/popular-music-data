When the day is dawning
On a Texas Sunday morning,
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waitin' for me there.
Every lonely city 
Where I hang my hat,
Ain't as half as pretty 
As where my baby's at.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I've been hugging my pillow
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Crying over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.

There's a church bell ringing,
Hear the sound of joy that it's singing
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's comin' to see her.
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me going
Through the wind and rain.

Is this the way to Amarillo?...
