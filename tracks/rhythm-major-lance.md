What's that sound?
(That's rhythm)
Everybody round
(Got rhythm)

There can be no beat
(Without rhythm)
Makes me wanna move
My feet
(That's rhythm)

It's in my bones
Anytime my music carries on
I feels like rhythm

If you like to dance
(Get rhythm)
This is your chance
(For rhythm)

I can't keep still
With bongos playing
And everybody feels that way

It's in my bones
Anytime the music carries on
Oh, I feel like rhythm

You can beat the drums
Lord, if you wanna
Let the bongos play
And I dance all night

Let the music flow
Oh, I never wanna go
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm

It's in my bones
Anytime my music carries on
Lord, I feel like rhythm

You can beat the drum
Lord, if you wanna
Let the bongos play
And I dance all night

Let the music flow
Oh, I never wanna go
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm

It's in my bones
Anytime the music carries on
Lord, I feel like rhythm

If you like to dance
(Get rhythm)
This is your chance
(Get rhythm)

I can't keep still
(Get rhythm)
Oh, I'm like the
Rolling wheel
