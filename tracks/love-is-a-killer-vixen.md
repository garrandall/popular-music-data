Only a fool believes 
It's better to have loved and lost 
Than never to have loved at all 
But I don't wanna take that fall 
It's a long long long way down 

I'm hurt 
Love struck me down again 
Enticed me in and pulled the pin 
Blew my tender heart sky high 
Now in my pain I'm asking why 
As I'm crying 
Should I give it my last try 
Or say goodbye 

Love is a killer 
A homicidal fiend 
Love is a killer 
It'll be the death of me 
I got a target on my back 
For a cupid dressed in black 
Love is a killer 
It's killing me 

Love so sweetly beckoning 
I've seen your face 
Called your name 
I tasted tears you cried 
Lived in shadows in my mind 
Frozen here in time 
Don't leave me here to die 

Love is a killer 
A homicidal fiend 
Love is a killer 
It'll be the death of me 
I've got a target on my back 
For a cupid dressed in black 
Love is a killer 
It's killing me 

You fascinate and yet frustrate
Demand so much of me, yeah 
I've had enough 
It's tearing me up inside 
Cross my heart, hope to survive 
You got a smoking gun 
Well don't shoot my love, no!

You're a killer 
A homicidal fiend 
Love is a killer 
It'll be the death of me 
I've got a target on my back 
For a cupid dressed in black 
Love is a killer 
Love is a killer, no
Love is a killer, no, no
I got a target on my back
for a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me
