I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Runnin' through fields of daisies a wadin' through the creek
You love me and it's invitin' to go where life is more excitin'
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine
I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show
And the joy that the bluebird brings

I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

There's just something bout the mornin'
Makes each day a joy to see
Night time brings a peaceful feelin' to rest inside of me

I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

Oh I love you please believe me
Uh huh, I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine
