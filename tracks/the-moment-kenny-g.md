I can remember, the day we met
I still remember our first french kiss
The moment when I knew that you, would make sweet love to me
The moment that I knew, you'd always be the one, one, 
I'd be dreaming of


Twas was a long time ago, when we fell in love
And even longer ago, when we both were young
But it's nice to know, that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold


Baby, I can remember the way, the way that we laughed
And you, you were my lover and girl, my best friend
And its crazy I would go through the ups and downs
Our feelings never change, knowing in my heart, you'll always be the one, one
I'll be dreaming of 


It was a long time ago, when we fell in love
Even longer ago, when we both were young
But it's nice to know, that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold
There just ain't no place like home


Ohhhhhhh
Twas was a long time ago, when we fell in love
Even longer ago, when we both were young
But it's nice to know, that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold, gold, gold
