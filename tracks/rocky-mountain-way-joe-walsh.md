Spent the last year
Rocky mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture
I think it's safe to say
Time to open fire
And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, oh yeah
'cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rocky mountain way, ooooh

Well he's tellin' us this,
He's tellin' us that,
Changin' it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat
Playin' it play by play
It's time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad
'cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rocky mountain way

And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad
'cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
So much better
So much better
It's so much better
It's so much better

Rocky mountain way
