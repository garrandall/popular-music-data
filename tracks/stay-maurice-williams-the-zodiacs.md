Stay, ahhh
Just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me that you're going to

Now your daddy don't mind
And your Mommy don't mind
If we have another dance, ya
Just one more time

Oh, won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
Please let me hear you say
That you will

Won't you place your
Sweet lips to mine
Won't you say you love me
All the time

Oh ya, just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me your going to
Come on, come on, come on, stay
Come on, come on, come on, stay, oh la de da
Come on, come on, come on, stay, my, my, my, my
Come on, come on, come on, stay
