Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him


If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away


I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
"Me and Bobby McGee"
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile


If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far


If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away
