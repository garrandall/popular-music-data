Spendin' my vacation in the summer sun
Gettin' lots of action, havin' lots of fun
Scorin' like a bandit till the bubble burst
Suddenly it got to be September first!
Woe is me... all summer long I was happy and free
Save my soul, the board of education took away my parole

I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me, till the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there till then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa whoa, I gotta go, Back to School... Again

Geometry and History it's just a pain
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain
Don't they know that I deserve a better fate
I'm really much too young to matriculate
Mama please, your child's come down with a fatal disease
Mama said: "C'mon you lazy bum and get your butt outta bed!"

You gotta go back, back, back to school again
It's bye bye fun, get your homework done, and better be in by ten
I gotta go back, back back to school again
Whoa whoa, I gotta go... Back to School... AGAIN!

I got my books together and I dragged my feet
And then I saw this angel boppin' down the street
I said hey pretty baby, "How's about a date?"
She said "I'm goin to school and I can't be late!"
I could see, the look in her eyes was sayin' follow me
And I was caught... I thought of playin' hooky but on second thought

I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me, till the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there till then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again...
Whoa whoa, I gotta go... Back to School... AGAIN!
