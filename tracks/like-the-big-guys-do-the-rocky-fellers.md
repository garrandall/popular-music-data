Like the big guys do
I wanna do it
Like the big guys do
I wanna do it

Ah, huh
Down on the floor there, every night
That's where you'll find me under the light
Why don't the? girls? my way
Hoping that one will be mine someday


I wanna hold someone
Love someone
Kiss someone
Every night
Tell someone my love is true
I wanna do the things that the big guys do

Why do they always pass me by
Why don't they stop when I give them the eye
Why don't those city girls ever see
There's a lot lovin' in a little package like me



I wanna tell them lies, like the big guys do
I wanna treat them bad, like the big guys do
I wanna break their hearts, like the big guys do
I wanna make them sad

Every day? someone new
I wanna do the things like the big guys do



Like the big guys do, I wanna tell them lies
Like the big guys do, I wanna treat them bad
Like the big guys do, I wanna break their hearts
Like the big guys do, I wanna
