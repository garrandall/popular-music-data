One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
Though I know it's never happened before
But the sun won't shine and the grass won't grow
And the rain won't fall and the wind won't blow
Yes, One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
And you'll know that I don't love you anymore

But until then let's use the time we have
Whatever comes our way to live and love
Every minute, every hour, every day

One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
Though I know it's never happened before
But the sun won't shine and the grass won't grow
And the rain won't fall and the wind won't blow
Yes, One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
And you'll know that I don't love you anymore

So stay a while but if you want to fly
You're free just like a dove
Cause I won't hold you any longer
In a lifetime full of love

One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
Though I know it's never happened before
But the sun won't shine and the grass won't grow
And the rain won't fall and the wind won't blow
Yes, One of these day's Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
And you'll know that I don't love you anymore

Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
Sunday's gonna come on Tuesday
