Hearts afire
Creates love desire
Take you high and higher
To the world you belong

Hearts afire
Creates love desire
High and higher
To your place on the throne


We've come together on this special day (huh)
Sing a message loud and clear (hm, mm)
Looking back, we've touched on sorrowful days (well!)
Future, past, they disappear (haw, haaaw)


You will find (you will find)
Peace of mind (yeah, ha)
If you look way down
In your heart and soul
Ah, don't hesitate
Cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart
Ah, cause you'll never
Never grow old (never, never, never, never, never, never)
Oh, yeah... yeah, ha


That's the way (that's the way)
Of the world (of the world)
Plant your flower (gonna plant your flower)
And you'll grow a pearl (heeey, oh, oh, oh)
Child is born
With a heart of gold (oh, ah, ah, yeah)
Way of the world (gonna plant your flower)
Makes his heart grow cold


Oh, oh, oh, ha, Lord
Can't you see me, y'all?

Say, hey
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Ah, luh




Hearts afire
Creates love desire
Take you high and higher
To the world you belong

Haw, haw


We've come together on this special day
Send a message loud and clear (ay, yah!)
Looking back, we've touched on sorrowful days
While future disappear


You will find (you will find)
Peace of mind (ay, hey)
If you look way down
In your heart and soul
Ah, don't hesitate
Cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart (Cause)
Cause you'll never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Ay, yee, ay, yee, ay, yee, yeah, ha


That's the way (yaow!)
Of the world (yaow! hey, yeah!)
Plant your flowers
And you'll grow a pearl (ah, oh
Child is born (child is born)
