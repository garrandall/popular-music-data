Hit me
Right in the sternum this time, T-baby
Shit, you already know, you already know
You already know, damn, shit
This that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler music
So ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, damn

Goddamn
Missed and hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'mma paint the city red with this one
I'mma head with this one
See you fucking with the boy
Who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance, just that persistence with that commitment
If I don't get it somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight 
And I deserve the throne 
If the kid ain't right 
Then let me die on this song

See I be riding just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king shall be

So I be who I be
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and
Please say the motherfucking
So I be who I be
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and
Please say the motherfucking

Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing
What I gotta do for me and you and we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no
Lord

Money is the motivation
Facing the avenue
Back touchin' the wall
Got the weed
Got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (birrr) damn
Hop in that thing and merk off
Swerve off

You know me, they call me Birdman Jr
Anybody murderer
If Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the opera
All black guap tent locked in
I can let them shots out
You can't get no shots in

Bulletproof
Leave a nigga with a bullet roof
Shoot you in your mouth Leroy
They call him bullet tooth
I'm like what it do, what it do
There's a full court
Pressure I'm just going for the two

If I'm open for the three
I'mma take it in a second
Even if there's one second
I'mma make it. It's nothing
I don't take it for granted
I don't take it for nothing
I take it for what it's worth to the dirt motherfucker

Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing
What I gotta do for me and you and we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances

My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no
Lord

I ain't never killed nobody I promise
And I promise if you try me
He gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy will lay flat so flat

That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbating 
Black Peter Pan fly 'til I die what you saying
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stand

Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look great in a four-seater
You know I be out here riding a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons four of them whores

And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothing
Now get your hustle up

Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing
What I gotta do for me and you and we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances

My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no
Lord

Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing
What I gotta do for me and you and we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances

My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no
Lord

Man, man
Just be that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler music
Y'all, so ride to it y'all
And vibe to it y'all
I'm asking y'all please please

Young Weezy got that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler music
Ride to it y'all and
Vibe to it y'all
Vibe to it y'all
Shh
Shit
Shit

It's real shit man, it's real talk man
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it ay
It's real shit man, it's real talk boy
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it

I ain't bragging, I ain't boasting it's the way it go
I ain't bragging, I ain't boasting it's the way it is
Better guard your kids, guard your face
Better guard your body, we warned the place
We here, fuck bitches
It's Young Money, nigga
