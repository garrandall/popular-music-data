Yo, it's Xscape,
For the nine-five,
And you know how they do,
So lay back, kick it,
and let's get live.


Ladies, who often do you have,
A man that makes you wanna cry,
A man that makes you wanna laugh.
Sisters, well I think I've found the one,
He does everything I like,
And knows haw to get the job done.
He makes me...


Clap my hands, stomp my feet,
Every little thing that you do to me,
Feels so good, feels so good.



Ladies, never have I felt this way before,
He makes me feel so good,
And keeps me warm.
He makes me feel so good,
So good from my head to my toes.
All the things that this man does,
Everyone should know.
And I...


Don't ever wanna lose this feeling,
His love is real,
I'm willing to stay right by his side,
'Cause I know he'll always be mine.
The way he touch me makes me lose my control,
And when you have a man like this,
Love dictates your soul.
He makes me...




This is for those that like to pop the trunk and let it bump, b-bump.
