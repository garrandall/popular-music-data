It makes you wonder just who they really are
They say, "Money is no object, and we've got a car"
They kidnapped Tony
Where did they go
They went to get it done before he got too old
They're incognito, they're into fame
They think they know it all--you know their family's to blame
Isn't it funny, isn't it sad
You come up empty thinking 'bout the good times that you had, but

I like:
When they talk real loud, try to tell you what they know
I like:
When it blows real hard and it doesn't even show

They say, "It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me"
I say, "That's plain as day, I hope you've got yours right anyway"

It makes you wonder 'bout the things they say
"We are never gonna leave", "We are never gonna stay"
They talk for nothing, they talk for free
They talk behind your back and to your face they're really sweet
Check out the language, check out the clothes
Their mother buys their shoes and where she gets them no one knows
They go to parties to steal the show
By talking really loud and try to tell you what they know, but

I like:
When they talk real loud, try to tell you what they know, say
I like:
When it blows real hard and it doesn't even show

They say, "It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me"
I say, "That's plain as day, I hope you've got yours right anyway"

I like:
When they talk real loud, try to tell you what they know, say
I like:
When it blows real hard and it doesn't even show, say
I like:
When they haven't seen a thing and try to tell you where to go, say
I like:
When it blows real hard and it doesn't even show

What do they really know?
