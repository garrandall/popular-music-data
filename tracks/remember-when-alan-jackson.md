Remember when
I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when
We vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when
Old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when
The sound of little feet was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when
Thirty seemed so old now lookin' back
It's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when
We said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

Remember when
Remember when
