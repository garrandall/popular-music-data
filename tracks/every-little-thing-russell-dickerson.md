My baby, she's Alabama
A dixie land delight, kissin' me like molasses
Slow and sweet, mhm just right
She's an endless August summer
Sunshine 365
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time

Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love

Yeah, she's Seattle and Sonoma
Runs on coffee and red wine
She's easy like Sunday morning and wild like Saturday night
She's 24 carat goodness, an angel's all I see
She dressed up for everything, but she only dress down for me

And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love

My baby, she's Alabama
My dixie land delight
She's everybody's dream girl but she's all mine 

And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love

About her love
Hey hey yeah
About her love
