Queen of the surfer girls

She's got stars in her eyes and knots on her knees now
Her crazy grass shift really sways in the breeze now
Ridin' down a heavy, or lying in the sand
She's the hippest surfer girl in the land

And she's my Honolulu Lulu
She's my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

Well, she handles all the big ones every year in Makaha
And all the surfers know her from Rincon to Baja
When the beach is quiet and you know we're out of luck
We pray for surf while making out in our truck

And she's my Honolulu Lulu
She's my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

Just me and Honolulu Lulu
Me and Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

Yeah, she's my Honolulu Lulu
Yeah, my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

I tell you once upon a time, you know she got a little bold
When she tried to hook a spinner but her wax wouldn't hold
Over the falls 'stead of hangin' ten
But then she'd paddle out and try it again

But she's my Honolulu Lulu
She's my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls
