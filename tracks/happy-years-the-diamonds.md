Roll out of bed and I'm off to school
(Happy years, those happy years)
Like a real hep cat, I go to play it cool
(A-hoo, cha cha cha, a-hoo cha cha cha)

Eating with my baby in the lunchroom bar
(Happy years, those happy years)
Riding to school in my hotrod car
(A-hoo, cha cha cha, a-hoo cha cha cha)

Ponytail girls all wearing bluejeans
(Happy years, those happy years)
Now tell me, what looks cuter
Than a gal in her teens
(A-oo, cha cha cha, a-oo cha cha cha)

Rocking and rolling at the record shop
(Happy years, those happy years)
Falling in love over soda pop
(A-hoo, cha cha cha, a-hoo cha cha cha)

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh

After graduation, we'll steal a kiss
(Happy years, those happy years)
There is nothing in this world
Like my junior miss
(A-hoo, cha cha cha, a-hoo cha cha cha)

One day soon, we're gonna talk awhile
(Happy years, those happy years)
Then I'll take my baby
March her down the aisle
(A-hoo, cha cha cha, a-hoo cha cha cha
