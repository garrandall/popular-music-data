Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight, the light of love
Is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your eyes
Will you still love me tommorrow

Tonight, with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one
(You're not the only one)
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know that your love
Is a love that I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)...
