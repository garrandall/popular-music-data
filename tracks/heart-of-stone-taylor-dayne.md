We need to lay in each other's arms
There's no where else to go
It's all so easy and I want you to know
There'll never be another one who could get this close to me
Everything you give to me is everything I've ever dreamed of

Even when you turn your back now
I can feel you reaching for me
Even when you walk away
I'll still know where you're hiding

I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I've seen your tears fall when you thought you were alone
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it

You try to make like I'm not there
To show me how you feel
You don't have to hurt me with the hurt that you won't reveal
There'll never be another one who could get this close to you
I can give you everything that you've ever dreamed of

Even when you turn your back now
I can feel you reaching for me
Even when you walk away
I still know where you're hiding

I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I've seen your tears fall when you thought you were alone
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
The more you try to hide your love, the more it shows
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it

I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
The more you try to hide you love, the more it shows
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
Your eyes say yes even when you tell me no
I can't believe you've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it
