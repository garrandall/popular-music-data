This is the room
Where i sat and waited till the morning
Watching the door
You slammed so hard it broke the window
Up and down, ive climed these walls
It seems im trapped inside this

House full of reasons
I should be movin on
You had me believing
This is the way love goes
Off and on among, normal people

Down in the hall
The pictures of a happier couple
Just hang on the wall
And smile away through all the trouble
Side to side
The clock on the wall
Reminding me by the hour
Theres a ..................

House full of reasons
I should be movin on
You had me believing
This is the way love goes
Off and on among normal people

All day .........
And when its dark
It seems theres nothing here but
Nothing here but

A house full of reasons
I should be movin on
You had me believing
This is the way love goes
A house full of reasons
I should be movin on
You had me believing this is the way love goes
Off and on among normal people
