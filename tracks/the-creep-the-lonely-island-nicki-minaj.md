Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is...
The Creep.


When you're out in the club and you see a fly girl
Do the Creep (hah)
Do the Creep (hah)
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep (hoo)
Do the Creep (hah)


Well, we got a new dance so get up on your feet
It's real easy to do, and it's called 'The Creep'
Let your hands flap around like a Marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shaking your neck


Now pull your waistband up like you expectin' a flood
And slick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers; you a certified creeper.


When you see a country peach, laying out at the beach
Do the Creep (hah)
Do the Creep (hah)
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep (hoo)
Do the Creep (hah)


I was six years old when I started creepin'
My parents took it to their room and I started peepin'
You can't imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creepin' at the foot of the bed


Yeah they knew I was a creep, since the day I was born
Poppin' out my momma like some kettle corn
Yeah the doctor caught my head and he started freakin'
'Cause I came out clean - and I came out creepin'!


Nicki,
Nicki,
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki
Nicki!


When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside - it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling
Little did they know, that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha.
And they would dance, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la.
So pop-pop-pop your peepers,
and tweak out your sneakers
Don't sleep, come on get your Creep on with me!


Go on, get to sweatin' off a bride at her wedding
Do the Creep (hah)
And do the Creep (hah)


And when you sneak into a wake, and you see a beefcake
Do the Creep (hoo)
And do the Creep (hah)


And when the judge is a hottie and you can't control your body
Do the Creep (hah)
Do the Creep (hah)


So, get your knees flexin', and your arms T-rexin',


And Creep (hoo)
Do the Creep! (hah)


And don't forget to smile!
