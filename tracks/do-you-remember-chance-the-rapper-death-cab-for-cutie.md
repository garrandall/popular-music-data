Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever


I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns


Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever


I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the "27 Club"
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love


Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever


Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever? (Summer everlasting)
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
