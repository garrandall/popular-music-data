Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said, "Daddy, what are all those X's for?"
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
Started talking about football as they drove right past


So what do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?


Seventeen years old
She was out with her friends
They started drinking at some party
Until she was three sheets to the wind
Her momma always told her she could call no matter what
She was crying on the front steps
When her mom showed up

Sometimes you got to listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think
Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holding on
She looks at him and says, "I want to go home!"

Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?
Oh, what do you say?
