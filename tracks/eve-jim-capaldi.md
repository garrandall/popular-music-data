Capaldi

Eve, there's a woman in your eyes
Oh Eve, you made me realise
Eve, give me a smile
Oh Eve, you're only a child

But it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine

Eve, I'll never let you down
Oh Eve, I'll always be around

And it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine

Oh Eve, give me a smile
Oh Eve, you're only a child
