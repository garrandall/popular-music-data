Oh, come on and rock me, oh, girl
Oh, come on and rock me, oh, girl

Hey, girl, long time no see
Do you have a little time to spend with me?
I wanna know what's been going on
In your life, huh, talk to me, baby

Your hair, perfume you wear
Brings back memories, oh, of you and me
You look so fine, you blow my mind
All over again, oh

So much has happened in my life
Since we partied, what about you?
Now I've got myself together
And I know just what I want
And right now I know that it's you, you

Rock me tonight for old times sake
Would you, baby, hey?
Roll with me tonight for old times sake

Oh, girl, I'm gonna love you real good
Come on, let me do it now, you know I could
I really miss the way you squeeze and moan
And call out my name, woo, you can call me, baby

I remember you like to take your time
To get in the mood, oh, yes, you do, yeah
But once you're in the mood
You like to go, shake to the groove, oh yes, you do, girl

It's been so long since we've had a night together
I have missed you when I get through lovin' you, girl
Fire and desire
Will burn in you forever more, more

Rock me tonight for old times sake
Would you, baby, hey?
Roll with me tonight for old times sake
Woo, woo, would you, would you, would you?

Rock with me tonight for old times sake
Sweet, baby, yeah
Roll with me tonight for old times sake
Oh girl, come on and rock

So much has happened in my life
Since we parted, what about you?
Oh, now I've got myself together
And I know just what I want
And right now, girl, it's you, you

Rock with me tonight for a old times sake, sake
Won't you, baby, hey?
Roll, roll with me tonight for a old times sake
Feels so good, feels so right

Would you rock with me tonight for a old times sake?
Sweet baby, yeah
Would you come and roll with me tonight for a old times sake?
Oh, girl

Come on and rock me
Come on and roll with me, baby
Come on and rock me
Roll with me

I wanna feel you next to me
I want you to do the things
That we used to do together
Come on, let's make it right

I wanna feel you rock with a lot of lovin'
The way I used to do, girl
Do you remember?

I wanna rock and roll with you, baby
Come on, hey
I'm gonna rock and roll and hold and squeeze ya
Sweet thing, yeah
