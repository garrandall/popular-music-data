small wonder
How the world could get younger
When all the rockets go upwards
And living values go downwards
People messing up the planet
Wrecking city and hamlet
Wondering how they choose to plan it
It's such a crazy fast pace with the turn of a face

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Keep the family living
And by your friends you'll be giving
For your share of the earnings
Make the best of your learnings
And what you'll find is a good life
Simple cares for the bad strife
Ain't no reason for a sad life
You know we're really the same
And everybody's to blame

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Cause on the average sidewalk
It's full of fighting and mean talk
And the world is a false order
You know it's always the same
People looking for freedom
From the west to the east rung
But when they know they can get it
Or if they should really try
Makes a man want to cry

Cause we'll give you our last cry
And if we have to our last night
But if our brothers won't shed it
It would do us no better
But what use is our token
Lord if our bodies get broken
Then the message ain't spoken
And we'd have done it all wrong
So we're singing this song

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home

Well people we've got a dream
And it's a beautiful dream
That the longing to live
With the people that give
That's the right way to live
So be good to each other
Like everybody is your brother
Like you've got the same mother
And the world is your home
