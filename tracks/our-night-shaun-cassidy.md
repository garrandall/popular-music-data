Bet you've got a lot of lovers
Bet i'm not the only one
I've heard tell of all the others
And i know where you're coming from
I know where you're coming from
And going to
I even know exactly what you're gonna do

Bet you've got a lot of hearts
Breaking up on you all the time
Well
I got my eyes wide open
And I'm tellin' you
And won't break mine
And whatever you got in store for me
I got the same for you

And this will be our night
This will be our night
And i know that we can do it
Do it till we get it right
And this will be our night
This will be our night
And i know that we can do it
Do it if it takes all night

But there's never been a time
When you didn't know just what to say
Well
You think you're the kind
Who can jam up my mind
If it ain't that way
And whatever you want
Whatever you do
Don't you forget that i want it too

And this will be our night
