Love walked out the door, it's a cryin' shame we don't have it no more
Love walked out the door, it's a cryin' shame we don't have it no more

Readin' your letter, I didn't know whether
To call you up and talk again
When I saw the name you signed, flowin' through my mind
Was a memory of way back when
Now all that I can wish you is good luck, baby
Sorry that it couldn't be me
But it felt so right
If we'd held on tight
I'd be with you tonight
We never should'a let our...

I won't forget the summer, my heart was like a drummer
Just beatin' every night away
Walkin' in the sun with you, baby we were one
And the love was really ours to stay
Now all I get to keep is a faded picture
You belong to her today
And the memory
Of-a you and me
Is just a used to be
We never should'a let our...

Love slipped through my hands
It's a cryin' shame I can't play in your band
Love fell at my feet
It's a cryin' shame the bitter isn't the sweet
O-oh
O-oh
I'm so sorry, baby...
