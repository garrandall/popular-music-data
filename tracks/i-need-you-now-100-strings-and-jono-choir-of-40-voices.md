If I ever needed you
I need you now
I can't remember when
I've ever been so blue

If I ever needed love
I need it now
I feel so all alone
I don't know what to do

No day or night goes by
When I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die
From wanting you

I can't ease my aching heart
But you know how
If I ever needed you
I need you now

No day or night goes by
When I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die
From wanting you

I can't ease my aching heart
But you know how
If I ever needed you
I need you now
