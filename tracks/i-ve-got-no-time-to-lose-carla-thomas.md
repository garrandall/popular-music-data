No time to lose (No time to lose)

Love ain't got no time to lose
I've got to find a man (Ah!)
Make his mother friend (Ah!)
I ain't got to try to see (Ah!)
If you're come back to me

I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose (No time to lose)
I was a fool (I was a fool)
Oh, I was such a poor fool

Why I've been living here? (Ah!)
Living here (Ah!)
I've to find a guy (Ah!)
And apologize

I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose
No time to lose (No time to lose, no time to lose)

I will cry
When you told me
Is there a woman?
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Darling, my darling
Darling, my darling ( found me...)

Woah, somebody, please tell to my darling
Have got you slept in my bed? (Ah!)
 (Ah!)
And if it me (Ah!)
That you're slept on me

I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose
No time to lose (I've got no time to lose)
No time to lose (Woah, no time)
No time to lose (I've got no time to lose)
No time to lose (Woah, no time)
No time to lose (I've got no time to lose)
No time to lose (Woah, oh no...)
