First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide with one burning thought
Will your arms open wide?
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms
Ebb tide
