And so I ask you American people to vote my ass president, please.
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Mr. Trump, your turn to make a final statement.

I was born in my own hospital, a great hospital, the best you could imagine.
Delivered by the doctor that I bought and he thanked me, he said said, "Donald, thank you t-this is terrific"

I bought at least a couple wifes, 3 highest paid women in America.
But the third one doesn't speak English just right and she's great I-I see her on holidays. Terrific.

Now this country needs a good, strong leader.
I'm real busy but I may just have the time,
If I let you elect the Trumpster, you're welcome.

I'm a great leader and I can't read.
We're being rapen by the Chinese.
I'll make these China dogs my bitches.
I'm the filthy richest.

We need a hero that'll come help,
I'll sell America to myself.
I'll build yous highways and some bridges.
I'm the filthy richest.

I want to make this country great - right now we're NOT great
But the Mexicans keep coming here to rape and by the way - at least rape in English.

I'll build a wall no-one could climb.
No-one will climb this wall.
And the spics could rape on their own fuckin' side.
Mexico is the new China.

Now I'm seein' people talk about the Trumpster,
Saying things that quite frankly aren't nice
When I'm in charge of our nuclear program,
You're all bombed (and fired).

I'm a great leader and I can't read.
We're being rapen by the Chinese.
I'll make these China dogs my bitches.
I'm the filthy richest.

We need a hero that'll come help,
I'll sell America to myself.
I'll build yous highways and some bridges.
I'm the filthy richest.

We're losing, it's a catastrophe.
I'll negotiate a better deal.
I'll do a good job.

We need a leader pres that'll get us out of our debt, help the people get lower wig prices.
We need a leader pres that'll get us rid of ISIS - rip 'em all to shreds fuckin' towel heads.
We need a leader pres that'll get us drivin' hybrids, give us all some bread with the side of PEZ.
And tell the Mexicans that all the illegal migrants you gotta get a license.

I'm a great leader and I can't read.
We're being rapen by the Chinese.
I'll make these China dogs my bitches.
I'm the filthy richest.

We need a hero that'll come help,
I'll sell America to myself.
I'll build yous highways and some bridges.
I'm the filthy richest.

And I just cant help all yous bitches.
I'm the filthy richest, it's gonna - it's gonna be terrific.
'Cause I'm the filthy richest.
