I'm gonna shake you
Whip you up a frenzy in your heart
I'm gonna break you
Make you wish you'd loved me from the start
Like a rag doll, baby, I'm gonna play you
Shock you, lady then I'm gonna shake you
Baby girl, oh my baby girl
'Til you want me, like I want you
'Til you love me, like I love you
I'm gonna shake you
Rain down kisses on your pretty head
I'm gonna take you
Leave you lying naked on my bed
Gonna chase you, baby, then I'm gonna catch you
Race you lady 'til your heart attacks you sweet thing
Oh, yeah, sweet thing
'Til you love me, like I love you
'Til you need me, like I need you
Shake it, listen up baby
Shake it, hold tight lady
Shake it, I can't take a maybe
Shake it, gonna getcha crazy
Shake it, tears 'll be a tumblin'
Shake it, words 'll be fumblin'
Shake it, pushin' and a shovin'
Shake it, loving is a tough thing
I'm gonna shake you
Whip you up a frenzy in your heart
I'm gonna break you
Make you wish you'd loved me from the start
Like a rag doll, baby, I'm gonna play you
Shock you lady, then I'm gonna shake you, baby girl
Oh, my baby girl
'Til you want me like I want you
'Til you love me like I love you and I do
Shake it, listen up baby
Shake it, hold tight lady
Shake it, I can't take a maybe
Shake it, gonna getcha crazy
Shake it, tears 'll be a tumblin'
Shake it, words 'll be fumblin'
Shake it, pushin' and a shovin'
Shake it, loving is a tough thing
