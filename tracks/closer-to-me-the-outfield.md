One look - one touch - no chance
I know what you're thinking
Your move- you're mixed up - no choice
Say you get the meaning
And I'm not leaving here without you baby
I like everything I've seen

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be yea'
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me

One day - one line - untied
And we can talk it over
She's hooked - she's mine - I say
Stay a little longer
An' I'm still waitin' on you baby
An' I've got anything you need

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be yea'
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me

Don't say - ya' too shy - hand jive
Anyway you want it
I'm here - all right - up tight
Ain't no doubt about it
And I'm not leaving here without you baby
I like everything I've seen

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be yea'
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me
