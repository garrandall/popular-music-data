Sad, sad, girl (sad girl)
I'm a sad, sad girl
'Cause I no longer have you
I'm a sad, sad girl
'Cause our romance is through
You went away
Just the other day
You didn't telephone
Left me all alone
I'm a sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl over you
(Over you, over you)
I'm a sad, sad girl
'Cause you did me wrong
I'm a sad, sad girl
'Cause you've been gone much too long
Well, I feel like crying
I feel like crying
I'm almost, almost dying
And I'm a sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl over you
(Over you, over you)
(Over you)
I loved you so
How much you'll never know
But now you're gone
And the thought still lingers on
I'm a sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl
Sad, sad girl over you
Over you (over you)
Sad and blue (over you)
'Cause of you (sad and blue)
Left me baby (over you)
(Sad and blue, over you)...
