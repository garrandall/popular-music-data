I'm doin' this for all my ladies
I know you thinkin' yo it sound a lullaby right?
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, A-V we so sick
We about to do this REMIX!!
Radio play this


On the highway and it's Friday
In my big truck tryna get home to you
Stop and get a bottle to pop
I'll be off in the night time when we do what we do
Best part of my day is when we rollin' it up 
And we blowin' and we zonin'
Feelin' the buzz, plus the love
Up till early in the morning
Bone Thugs, that's right 
Let's go have some fun, in-the-bed-room
All day (all day) and all of the night 
I been workin' 
Now daddy comin' home 
And I'm lookin' for a little bit of action
I be comin' through wanna do that thang
Let me bless you with thug passion



Girl when we, make, love all night
I mean we, make good love all night
When we, make, love all night
We really make love


On the way to my honnies
Leavin' the club and I'm off that henney baby
Hope a nigga understand that a nigga got a plan
And I really gotta see this lady
Charter plane in Cleveland
Hit up my thugs, let 'em know I'm leavin'
Four hours, windows tinted 
Cause you know, how these hoes be creepin'
We off, and it's gonna get freaky 
This weekend, off in my house
And I'm ready 
Just hold it steady, I bet ya I break you off
Yes I'm slutty and you know
Thugs might get it rough I'm sorry
But dont know, you do what you do 
When you drop that dress with that body
My God!




Baby we did our thang off in the shower
Had me goin' a whole hour
Thought I was fair like I was a coward
When you hit the streets and you felt this power
Of the thang I swang, thangs won't change
And I need that lovin'
Baby that baby, you got in the oven
All I need is kissin' and huggin'
All of the drama you can keep it
Ain't no secret, it's revealed
Walk-The-Walk 
Girl gon' and shake that sex appeal
I'm still here 
Always gon' be here, never gon' leave
Wanna get down with Steve?
And you my boo, ooh


Cum at the same time
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Thick up inside you, gristle (ooh)
That's eight and half to nine in ya
Gushy like Niagara
Feelin' my spit ends
Amazed because I'm in between your thighs lickin'
And other people they be fightin'
And I rap fast, so what 'chu think I'm finna do with
??
One hundred and fifty five 
Seventy one thousand got you paralyzed
Cummin' though she's flabbergasted
I'm Duracell, and others they just don't last
Hittin' the vehicle with homeboy A-vant
Let's mash, Cleveland call back


It's the house, in the boat, in the jeep babe
In the tube, in the pool, or the beach babe
Get your groove on (gotta get cha groove on) get your
grove on 


I'ma make you love me baby


It's the house, in the boat, in the jeep babe
In the tube, in the pool, or the beach babe
Get your groove on (gotta get cha groove on) get your
grove on 


Baby do it to me!!




And I love the way you feel
Girl I love it
Throw it on the floor
Girl I love it
Throw it on the couch
