I went down to 42nd street
Thought I'd get a bite to eat
I saw a girl that I'd like to meet
You know, she sure looked good

Told me that her heart was broken
Asked me what it was I's smoking
All she had was an old bus token
Yes, I would

She cried a tear
And said she was alone
And would I be so good
To accompany her home
Yeah, I could, yeah

(CHORUS)
But everybody knows Matilda
Everybody knows Matilda
Ain't no life for a young girl
All alone in a great big world
Matilda

Took me to shack on the edge of town
All the shades were pulled and drawn
Nobody, not a soul around
She smiled at me

Mixed drinks and I fixed my head
Drank it down, made me feel like lead
When I asked her, where was the bed
She said, I'd see

She pulled me close
Now what was I to do
My head was spinning
As she said take off your shoes
And I agree, yeah

(CHORUS)

Heard a heavy knock upon the door
Scared me so bad, I fell on the floor
Heard a voice that sounded sore
Said, let me in

Matilda said her boyfriend had a gun
Sorry, baby, but you have to run
But I was gone before she was done
I left my skin

Flew out the window
As the door came tumbling down
Didn't even say goodbye
I was homeward bound
Just can't win, no

Now everybody knows Matilda
Everybody knows Matilda
Ain't no life for a young girl
All alone in a great big world

Everybody knows Matilda
Everybody knows Matilda
Everybody knows Matilda
Everybody knows Matilda...
