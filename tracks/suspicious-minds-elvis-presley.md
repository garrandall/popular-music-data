We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?


We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds


So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)


We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds


Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you


We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?


Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby...
