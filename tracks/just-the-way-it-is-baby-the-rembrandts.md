Do you remember once upon a time - when you were mine?
The stars above were bright and new.
I pulled them down for you, just when I fell in love again.
You said that all good things must end

BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY (WHOAH WHOAH)
BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY

I've never had a hand for solitaire - it's so unfair.
That I should have my chance and lose?
I feel like I've been used to help you through another night. 
You spelled it out in black and white

BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY (WHOAH WHOAH)
BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY

The tides that once had carried you away - they bring you back today.
The time has washed away my pain.
I find that things have changed and disappeared without a trace.
You can't get back what you've erased
And I say 

BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY - THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS 
BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY - OH THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS
BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY 
BABY, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY
BABY,THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BABY -  JUST THE WAY IT IS
