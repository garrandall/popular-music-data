I remember looking up 
To look up to him 
And I remember most the time 
He wasn't there 
I'd be waiting at the door 
When he got home at night 
He'd pass me by to go to pass out in his chair 

And I'd say 
Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're swaying side to side 
You're footsteps make me dizzy 
And no matter how I try 
I keep tripping and stumbling 
If you'd look down here you'd see 
Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're leading me 

He stumbled in the gym 
On graduation day 
And I couldn't help but feel 
So ashamed 
And I wasn't surprised a bit 
When he didn't stay 
He stumbled out before they called my name 

And I thought 
Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're swaying side to side 
It's not just me who's watching 
you've caught everybody's eye 
And you're tripping and stumbling 
and even though I've turned 18 
Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're still leading me 

The old mans still like he always was 
But I love him anyway 
If I've learned one thing from him 
Its my kids will never have to say 

Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're swaying side to side 
You're footsteps make me dizzy 
And no matter how I try 
I keep tripping and stumbling 
if you'd look down here you'd see 
Walk a little straighter daddy 
You're leading me 

Yeah walk a little straighter daddy 
You're leading me
