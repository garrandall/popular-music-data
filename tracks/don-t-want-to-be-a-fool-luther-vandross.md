Love, what have you done, oh wow
I was sure up 'til now
That she was a friend
I stayed 'til the end
(Don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said I'm a bore
My heart hit the floor
(Don't be a fool anymore)


Each time around I tell myself
"It's the game of love"
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it 'til the end


I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again


Whenever a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same
(He doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart every time
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change
(He's never gonna change)


Oh, next time around I'll tell myself
"It'll be better than before"
I won't look back, there'll be no one
Tearing my heart out anymore, my baby
I've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear 'til the end


I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again


(No way) I mean no more
(Never again) Oh, no never
(I can't be a fool) Can't be, no way
No way, no way
Oh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool, no

(I can't love anybody walking on a one way street)
Any way, any way, any way, no
(If I don't find somebody, that'll be alright with me)
I know, I know it'll be alright now
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say it 'til the end


I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool never, never again


(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool
(Don't wanna be a fool) Ever again
(I don't wanna be a fool) Never, oh never, oh never again
(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool
