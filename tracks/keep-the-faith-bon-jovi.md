Mother mother tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father father please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son
Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, mother)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please believe me)
Everybody's bitching 'cause they can't get enough
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on


Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith


Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride, yeah
Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, father)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please don't leave me)
Everybody's bleeding
'Cause the times are tough
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on


Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you know it's never too late
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Oh yeah, ohyeah
Yeah yeah yeah


I've been walking in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me crying
Trying to wash away this pain
Mother father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase (Everybody needs somebody to hate)
And every night we fall from grace (Everybody's bitching 'cause they can't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face (Everybody needs)
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on (Everybody, keep the faith)


Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord you gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on, yeah
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Everybody keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh yeah, ohyeah, ooheah, ohohah, oh oh
Everybody needs somebody to love
(Oh yeah, ohyeah, ooheah, ohohah, oh oh)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
Everybody's bitching 'cause they can't get enough
Everybody needs
Everybody, keep the faith
