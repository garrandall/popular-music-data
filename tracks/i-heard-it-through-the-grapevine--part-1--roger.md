Grapevine
(Grapevine)

Oh, grapevine, oh, grapevine
(Grapevine)
Oh, grapevine, oh, sho' 'nuff, I need you
(Heard it through the grapevine)

I heard that you're gonna leave me, oh, I
Oh, yeah, I heard that you're gonna leave me, oh, I
I heard it through the grapevine, oh
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine

Somebody told me 'bout your plans to leave me
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine, oh, wow
(Wow)

Bet you wondered how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between us guys, you know I love you much more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday, oh Lord

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
{Longer would you be mine)
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
{Longer would you be mine)

Oh, grapevine, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't leave me, girl, because I need your love so bad
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else

Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
{Longer would you be mine)
Heard it through the grapevine, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Heard it through the grapevine)
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Grapevine, I don't want nobody else
Naby, I don't want nobody else
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me, don't you leave
Don't you leave me, no, don't leave me, don't do it, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, I)

How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(Please, don't tell your mama)
How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(She'll start cryin')

How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(Never try me, try me, baby)
How much longer, longer would you be mine?
How much longer, longer would you be mine?
How much longer, longer would you be mine?
(I need you, I need you so bad)

How much longer, longer would you be mine?
How much longer, longer would you be mine?
(Need your lovin', need your lovin', need your love, your love, your love)
I really want you, waitin' for your love, your love, your love, your love
Oh

Heard it through the grapevine
(Said, I heard it, said I heard it, baby
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me now)
Heard it through the grapevine
(Said, I heard it through, heard it through, heard it through, tell me)

Mmm, hm, your love, you know I want it
(Just a little bit of soul now)
Your love, your love, got to have it, your love

How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(Baby, mama, baby)
How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(I love you)
How much longer, darling, would you be mine?
(Oh, oh)

Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine
