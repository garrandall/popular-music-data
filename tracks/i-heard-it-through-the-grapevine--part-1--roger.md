I'm in love, with this girl
And her name is, Mary Jane, yea
She my main thing, I'm her man
Life would not be the same, if she wasn't around
She be holding me down, when I'm down
And liftin' me up till, we in the clouds
When we make love, she's so loud
Now all my neighbors know it's going down


See I remember when we first met
I was young, tryna stunt with my big cousins in the backyard and my momma in the front
Cold as fuck, I had my hoodie on
You was wrapped in a blunt
Never thought puttin' my lips on you would get me grounded for months (damn)
We just start talkin' recently
Never thought that we would be
No niggas or no kids
You said ain't no sticks or seeds in me
That's perfect, so I did it, licked it up and then hit it
And ever since I hit that I can't quit that
Girl you dizzy
I go crazy soon as I smell you
Get butterflies when I'm stuck in life
And I'm going through hell, I inhale you
Can't find enough words to tell you that you got me weak
We used to hot box Jeeps, now we smokin' out top notch suites
And we, feeling grand, feeling great, feeling good, let them hate
My eyes down, windows up, that's the way we light the blunts
I can't even front, I spend way too much on you every month
I'm smokin', not drinkin, you know what I'm thinkin'
I'm chillin', just chilling' they think that I'm sleepin'
We used to be creepin' now it ain't no secrets
You mine and that's how we gon' keep it, I'm in love




Uh uh, it ain't no shame in my game, I just be doing my thang
Making my moves everyday, O.G. said stay in ya' lane
When you learn to drive in L.A, the traffic here ain't the same
And the police playin' no game, neither them niggas who bang
It ain't just here, I'm just saying, this is where I was raised
Land of the free and the brave and we all supposed to get paid
And then they're making their name, real niggas ghetto, they slay
Yeah that's just part of the game
I know some niggas quite well, for saying slight livin' hell
Never got no good to tell, like it made letters and L's
Down for possession to sell, though his intention mean well
They gave my nigga like 12, my nigga hitting them licks
They tryna give him the L
Sometimes I roll up the L, smoke it all by myself
Think of how I got this far without having no help
Glad I always had this girl by my side to support
Always got me through tough times, and for that I'm in love




Dedicating this to Mary Jane
Yeah that Mary Jane, I love that girl
Yeah that's on everything




I need the James Brown light right quick
Roger Troutman to write my shit
A hip way to ignite my spliff
And some college girls to come supply my fix
Cause I heard through the Grapevine
It take time in the mirror to stay fine, study in day time
Night time is play time, said she love to play Shine at breaktime
Well, that means you know me let's have a great time
I'm a send the addie, now throw that in your Navi (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now pull up with you and your baddies
I got Bourbon and rolled a few fatties
And you gotta fatty behind you
I'm sure I ain't have to remind you but baby I had to come find you
Before you walked in and start hurtin niggas
You curvy and you know for curving niggas
But ain't swerving me
Let's hit the room and talk the birds and bees
Lay up after burning purple tree
We ain't perfect but match up so perfectly, girl this shit works for me
But you got work at 3 so gone and get to your check
I love to watch you leave with all do respect
You got booty, brains, and beauty baby you blessed
And that's why you fuck with the best


And I don't want nobody else, I just want you to myself
I don't want nobody else, I just want you to myself
I don't want nobody else, I just want you to myself
Said don't want nobody else
Girl I don't want nobody else nooo


Best, the best, the best
Sir with honours, back, chest, work
Your homegirls be dancing they super nasty
But they classy one of them got class after this
They know they won't be another niggas flyer as me
Look around the room lil mama
You won't find a man in here higher as me
This a view you gotta see
I did been everywhere before february ended
Never seen any trouble to get into
And you look like you won't fuck up my windows
By puttin' yo chin low and hitin' this indo
What you say? Tell me somethin' girl what's poppin'?
Know you heard a lot like Oktane is cocky
And that ain't even true, just no one can stop me
To be honest baby Smokey got options
So let's not make this thing difficult
It's Friday Craig and you ain't got shit to do
So let's find something we can get into
And schedule a working lady for this interview
Cause mama say mama love when papa's on
And I'm cool with some folks and popa Jones
Who doesn't want sex and pizza
A couple times a week 'til we tired and we fall asleep
Girl you got it
