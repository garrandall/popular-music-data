Girl
Since you've been gone
Just let me say
Listen


Last night I said some things I didn't mean to say
Somehow I let my pride get in the way
And I'm so sorry (sorry for hurtin' you girl)
I know I was wrong, but if you just give me one chance
I'll make it up to you, do anything you ask me to


'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to (Do anything you ask me to)


Last night I laid awake
I couldn't stop thinking of you (thinking of you)
I must have called you a thousand times
But I couldn't get through, ooh
So much is going through my mind
(Did I really lose you this time?)
I just want you to come back home
Since you been gone, I haven't been the same
I would do anything


'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I would do anything for you
Do anything you ask me to
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to (Do anything you ask me to)


I realized how much I really need you (in my life)
'Cause without you here
My life is incomplete
Lady, you are my destiny


'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you, oh yeah
Do anything you ask me to (any little thing)
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to (I would do anything)

'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life (Anything for you, for you)
Do anything you ask me to (For you, for you)
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life (Did I really lose you this time?)
Do anything you ask me to

'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
Do anything you ask me to
