Havana Brown
RedOne
Mr Worldwide
From Miami, Morocco, to Australia
To the world, Dale!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em
Woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em
Woop!


When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart


We run, yes, we run the night (Night, night, night, night)
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night (The night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!


From the bottom of the map, Miami
To the land down under, Australia
You feel my draft, see my vision, and hear my hunger (My hunger)
As my money gets older, their's get younger
They sell their soul, but the devil knows I have no number
I'm global, baby (Hey!)
Official, baby (Hey!)
Go, go, baby (Hey!)
Oh, oh, baby (Hey!)
No, no, baby (Hey!)
Yeah, yeah, baby
Now jiggle it, baby
Let me tickle it, baby
I know I'm lost; it's gonna be hard to save me
I'm sorry; that's how Dade County raised me
Ya heard me, right? We run the night
Now fuck you, pay me (Woo!)


We run, yes, we run the night (Night, night, night, night)
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night (The night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!


Brushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keep pullin' me in (In)
Takin' me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been, oh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain


We run, yes, we run the night (Night, night, night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night (The night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
