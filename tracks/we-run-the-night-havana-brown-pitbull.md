All it takes is, some voli on the rocks
Havana Brown
Next thing you know shes on top of the bar no clothes for sure
Afrojack
She's telling me to slow down, I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god that was so much fun
Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened



Never happened

Last night we were off the chain
You name it we did it, you loved it for sure
I cant remember her name, but her ass that I remember for sure
Convenient amnesia, remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget to ask her
One life, two worlds
English, spanish, one night, two girls
English, spanish, shes telling to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god that was so much fun
Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened



Never happened

Different night different city
Different girl but its all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy you may run into my past
I don't got a concience, and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bonds men
One life, two worlds
English, spanish, one night, two girls
English, spanish, shes telling to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

I cant believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I cant believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god that was so much fun
Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened



Never happened
