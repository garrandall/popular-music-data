I heard you talking in your sleep
Is there anything that I can do
I don't believe we've had a word all day
'Bout anything at all
I heard you talking in the night
That's right, yes I heard ya call
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke
It's a name I don't recall 
I heard you softly whisper
I reached out to hold you near me
Then from your lips there came that secret
I was not supposed to know 

I heard you talking in your sleep
Is there anything that I can say
I don't believe we've had a word all day
'Bout anything at all
I heard you talking in the night
That's right, yes I heard ya call
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke
It's a name I don't recall 

I heard you talking in your sleep
Is there anything that I can do
I don't believe we've had a word all day
'Bout anything at all
