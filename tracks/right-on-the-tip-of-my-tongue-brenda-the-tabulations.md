It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say "I love you"
It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say "I love you"

I played the game of love and lost
And now my heart must pay the cost
I had the chance to make you mine, but I wasted too much time
And let your love slip away

It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say "I love you"
It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say "I love you"

While I was wondering where to start
She came along and won your heart
With all the tender words of love that I was thinking of
But never bothered to say

Mmm, wait a minute, wait a minute
I've got something to tell you
Don't walk away, baby

It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say "I love you"
It was right on the tip of my tongue
(And I forgot to say) to say, to say...

(Ah, ah, ah, tip of my tongue) my tongue
(Tip of my tongue)

SPOKEN:
Didn't you know? Couldn't you see it?
I tried to tell you...please...?
Don't you understand? I love you...
Don't walk away...oh, please...?
