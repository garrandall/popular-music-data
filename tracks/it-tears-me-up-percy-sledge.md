I see you walk with him,
I see you talk to him,
It tears me up
It tears me up
And start my eyes to cryin'
Oh, oh, I can't stop cryin'

I see him kiss your lips,
And squeeze your fingertips,
It tears me up
It tears me up
I feel like I'm dyin'
Oh, oh, I must be dyin'

It's a cold, cold world I'm livin' in
I turn my back and there you are with my best friend
Oh sometimes we pass on the street darlin'
And you looked at me and you can say, "I'm sorry, my sweet"
Maybe just saying I'm sorry would be enough
But then you'd look back at him, with your perfect smile,
And that'd make me feel kind of rough.
Oh darlin It tears me up

I see you smile at him,
You'll never tire of him
It tears me up.
It tears me up.
But there ain't nothin I can do now
Baby can't you see I'm still in love with you
Oh, can't you see I'm still in love with you, baby

Still waitin for something that I cannot have
Oh, baby, nothin' tears me up so bad,
Can't you see that I'm still in love with you baby
Oh, that tears me up so bad now baby
