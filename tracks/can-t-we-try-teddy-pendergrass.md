Come lay your head on my heart
Soon it'll be apart, stay here to the touch of morning
I'm glad we're leaving as friends
Baby, by the way, I forgot to say


Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
Sorry, I forgot myself
I guess that I'm just not myself


And I know that we're not supposed to cry
Love was supposed to die when people get to know each other
In case I don't see you again
Really wish you well, baby, this is hell


Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time and make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
At least we'll have a moment here with honest pain and tears


Then say goodbye
Come lay your head down on my heart
The morning suddenly leads you
You know that I don't need you
We can't go back to yesterday, go away
Girl, I wished you'd stay


Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time and make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we will end like we began and even though it's over
Can't we try, let's go back to yesterday, and I
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
See, once before I set you free, I just got to hold you close to me
Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
I want you to touch me, touch me one more time
And make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we can end like we began and even though it's over
Can't we try, let's go back to yesterday, and I
See, I'm just another, just another helpless fool in, in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
See, once before I set you free, I got to have you, I got to have you


Can't we try
Love was never born to say goodbye
