I like this right here, yeah 
Bad Boy, and we won't stop 
Faith, '99 




We can dance, dance, dance 
Clap your hands, hands, hands 
All night, if you're in the mood 
Do what you wanna do 
All night long 

Happy days are here 
So leave your cares behind 
Just relax your mind 
It's so easy to do it 

Just enjoy yourself 
If the feeling's right 
Get your groove on tonight 
Take your time tonight 
Everything's all right 
Ain't nothing but a party 



Get up on the floor 
Don't worry 'bout a thing 
The rhythm's got you now 
So come on, get into it 

Just enjoy yourself 
If the feeling's right 
Get your groove on tonight 
Take your time tonight 
Everything's all right 
Ain't nothing but a party 



Have a good time 
Lay back, relax 
Just free your mind 
Let the music take control of you 



Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
If it's a hot then I must've did it 
If it's not then I wasn't with it 
Bad Boy stay committed 
Whether hip-hop or R&B 
Featuring Faith Evans, co-starring me, P. Diddy 
You know I got the key to your city 
Unlock the door, rock some more 
Beats we lace 
Bad Boy heat the place 
We run R&B too cuz we keep the faith 
Givin the streets a taste 
Blaze the charts 


I remember 



In case you forgot 
First Lady Be making it hot 
Ain't nobody taking the spot 
Now it's Faith instead of pain 
Coming through with a better grain 
In the dash, cell phone better range 
Get the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters 
Damn, some things never change 
Can ya feel me? Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance 
Let's go 



Have a good time 
Lay back, relax 
Just free your mind 
Let the music take control of you
