Lessons learned
And bridges burned
To the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire
Tables turned
And I'm the one who's burning now

Well I'm doing alright
'Til I close my eyes
And then I see your face
And it's no surprise

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would yeah
I swallow my pride
Now I'm crawling back to you

I'm out of my head
Can't wait any longer
Down on my knees
I thought I was stronger

Just like that, like you said I'd do
I'm crawling back to you

Time can heal
But the scars only hide
The way you feel
And it's hard to forget how I left you hanging
On by a thread
With everything I said, I will regret it, yeah

I was doin' alright
Thought I could make it
Then I see your face
And it's hard to fake it

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would yeah
I swallow my pride
Now I'm crawling back to you

I'm out of my head
Can't wait any longer
Down on my knees
I thought I was stronger

Just like that, like you said I'd do
I'm crawling back to you

If you could find a way to forgive everything, I know you would
And I would take it all back, if only I knew that I could

Lessons learned
And bridges burned
To the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would yeah
I swallow my pride
Now I'm crawling back to you

I'm out of my head
Can't wait any longer
Down on my knees
I thought I was stronger

Just like that, like you said I'd do
I'm crawling back to you

I'm crawling back to you
I'm crawling back to you

Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
