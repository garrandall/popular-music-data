I remember long ago
Many things we didn't know
But hear me say
We still have time

Too many people
Change the world we live in
They don't know
They'll run out of time

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

Every stone that's been placed in
The Empire of Ancient grounds
One day they'll fall - you'll say goodbye

United they stand
Today there one land
Nobody knows
Who'll say goodbye

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go
I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go
