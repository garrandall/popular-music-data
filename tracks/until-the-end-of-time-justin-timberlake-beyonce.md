I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let me know that I'll be alright


'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time


You got me singing (oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah
Everybody sing (oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Everybody singing (oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)


Now if you ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well, baby boy, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just wanna spend my time being your girl
And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright


'Cause if your love was all I had (all I had)
In this life (oh oh oh oh oh)
That will be enough (enough) until the end of time
(Until the end of time)
Rest your weary heart (ohnd relax your mind (OOOOOOOOH)
'Cause I'm gonna love you, boy (love you, boy)
Until the end of time


Boy you got me singing (oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
You got me singing (Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Everybody singing (oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Everybody singing (Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah yeah yeah)


This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Break it down one time


Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah
Ohh oh oh oh
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Break it down one more time, Justin
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah (Oh)
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh


'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
That would be enough until the end of time
