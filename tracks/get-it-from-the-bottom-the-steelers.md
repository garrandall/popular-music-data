Cigarette maybe
But seldom touched
You won't

Soft lights and our favorite tune
I'm locked behind closed doors
Now baby, hey hey!


Get it get it from the bottom
Let's get it from the bottom
Get it from your heart
I've got to have it
From the bottom
Of your heart

Too much love
I've been told
Could hurt your heart
And ruin

But when my woman gets me
Behind closed doors
The feelin' I get
I can't control

Rocks under my pillow
And
Made me realize
That I love you
