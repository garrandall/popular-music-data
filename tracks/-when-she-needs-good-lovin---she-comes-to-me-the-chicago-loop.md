She goes down to the baker
When she wants a cake
She goes down to the butcher
When she wants a steak

She goes down to the doctor
When she's got a cold
She goes down to the gypsy
When she wants her fortune told


But when she wants good loving
My baby comes to me
Ba ba ba ba...
Yeah, when she wants good loving
My baby comes to me
She comes to me

She goes down to her daddy
When she wants a mink
She goes down to the plumber
When she wants to fix her sink

She goes down to the cobbler
When she wants her shoes
She goes to see her Mama
When she's done got the blues



Ba ba ba ba...

When she wants good loving
My baby comes to me
She comes to me
She comes to me...
