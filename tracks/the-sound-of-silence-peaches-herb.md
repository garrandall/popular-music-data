Hello, my old friend
Come to talk to you again
Cause a vision softly creeping
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping

And this vision that was planted
In my brain still remains within
The sound, sound, sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs
That voices never shared
No one dared disturb the
Sound, sound, sound of silence

Fools, said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you

But the words, like silent raindrops fell
Yes, they did and echoed (echoed)
In the well, well, well of silence

Ooh, the sound of silence
Ooh, the sound of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out it's warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said the
Words of the prophet are
Are written on the subway
Walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the
Sound, sound, sound of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
Ten thousand people, maybe more
Narrow streets of cobblestone
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

In the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
