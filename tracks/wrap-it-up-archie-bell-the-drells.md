I've been watching
You for days, now baby
I just love your
Sexy ways, now baby

You know my love
Will never stop, now baby
Just put your loving
I my box, baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

No more will I
Shop around, now baby
I know I got the best
In town, now baby

I've seen all I want
To see, now baby
Bring your loving straight
To me, now baby

Come on now

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

I'm gonna treat you
Like the queen that you are
Bring you sweet things
From my candy jar

Lord, you've got treats
You didn't ever use
Give it, give it to me
It won't be abused

I've been watching
You for days, now baby
I just love your
Sexy ways, now baby

You know your love
Will never stop, now baby
Just put your loving
In my box, baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Don't you know I need it
I'll take it

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it...
