Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
Calling out your name

Whoa and the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea

Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby can't you see
I stand accused of love in the first degree

Someday I believe it
You will come to my rescue
Unchain this heart you've been keeping
And let me start anew
The hours pass so slowly
Since they've thrown away the key
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please

Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby can't you see
I stand accused of love in the first degree
