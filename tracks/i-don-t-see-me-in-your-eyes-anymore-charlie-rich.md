(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I don't see me
In your eyes anymore
Oh, why can't I
Make them shine like before?

I don't see you
(I don't see you)
Or your heart in your kiss
(doo-doo-doo-do)
That you should say
(oh)
That you're mine. You resist
(you resist)

There was a time
Life was fine
Love was ecstasy
But now I doubt
What the outcome will be

I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before
(Ah-ah)

I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before
(I'll see me as before)
