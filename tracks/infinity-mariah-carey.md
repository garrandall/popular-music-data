Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you don’t already know


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity


How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments (duh)
Ain’t no being friends (duh)
Ain’t no false pretense (duh)
Ain’t no make amends (duh)
Ain’t no come against (duh)
That’s the story, ain’t no happy ends


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity


Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like you’re so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity


You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
