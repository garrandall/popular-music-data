But why?
Why


Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
And you hoppin' in that Benz truck, callin' all your friends up
Twisted off the liquor, talkin' crazy, can't stand up
Twisted off the vodka, drink some water
And I'm goin' crazy tryna get my life in order
Every time we pull up all my dogs got their hood up
I was tryna pull my hood up, got me ridin' with my hood up, Lord
From the bottom to the top and you know it
Leavin' one eye open, baby, like Fetty Wap
We be grindin' to the top, we never fold 'em
Bad bitches, they be callin', European cars rollin'


Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
Thatâs your bad, yup, thatâs too bad
Show is over, you ainât gotta act


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Thereâs an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity


It's like every time you call me
You know I can't leave you lonely
Cause I was always there when you need me
You said that you'd be there 'til the end
What must I say?
I never thought it would happen this way
But I can tell, you're down again
Yeah and I'ma fall, stayin' to the end


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Thereâs an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity


It started fuck you and your opinion, my heart cold, got no feelin'
Turnt up, got no ceilin', can't come down, no thank you
I know I'm no angel and I don't know why I go straight to danger
Can't explain it, lil' suspicion done drove her crazy
And now she goin' through my phone, shit doin' what she wants
You're surely delusional, losin' your mind right now
But I bet you'll miss me when I'm gone
Get the fuckin' with the suckas if you want
You finna go out back, know I had it and lost it
Know I'm mad, but hold up how you know I'm mad though?


Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back


Why you mad?
Oh baby I wanna know
