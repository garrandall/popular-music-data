Got Lil' Wayne pumpin' on my iPod
Thumpin' on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rockin' like a rockstar
Sling a lil' mud off the back, we can do that
Friday night football, Saturday Last Call, Sunday Hallelujah
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Then you know what I'm talking about

Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Til the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

Our party in the club is a honky tonk downtown
Yeah that's where we like to hang out
Chillin' in the back room
Hangin' with my whole crew
Sippin' on a cold brew, hey now!
Got a mixed up playlist, DJ play this
Wanna hear a country song
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Throw your hands up now, let me hear you shout

Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Til the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

Rap or country, city, farm
It don't matter who you are
Got a little fight, got a little love
Got a little redneck in your blood
Are you one of us?

Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Til the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
You're right on the money
Truck Yeah!
