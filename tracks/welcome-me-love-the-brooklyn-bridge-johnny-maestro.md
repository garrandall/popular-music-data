The hours before the morning
Walking home I pass her door
I send a special prayer
Up to the room on the second floor
For my mind is in there with her
But my body takes me home
And I need to have a love
Because I've been too long alone
So won't you
Welcome me love
My name is lonely
Tell that girl that I think of her only
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eye
Welcome me love
I know you don't know me
Take my hand there's a lot you can show me
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eye
I'll try to make her happy
And I promise I'll be good
I'll play it by the rules
Just like every lover should
Times that I will fail her
And we let each other down
But I'm sure that we can make it
As long as you're around
So won't you
Welcome me love
My name is lonely
Tell that girl that I think of her only
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eyes
Welcome me love
I know you don't know me
Take my hand there's a lot you can show me
I want to do it right
So help me lite the light in her eye
