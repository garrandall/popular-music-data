Oh Baby talk to me
Oh Baby can't you see
Cause I'm the shiest girl
In the whole wide world
So come on take my hand
And make me understand
I want to be with you
I wanna be so close to you
I wanna be so close to you

You say you're shy girl, just take a look
The lessons of love and I wrote the book
The book of love is about you and me
The things we'll do and how we'll be
Together forever just as one
The life we live is just for fun
And what you see is what you get

And you ain't seen a damn thing yet
So let me flow just how I like
The love you give girl feels so right
So give me a chance to take your soul
I wanna take your body
And take control
No way to move, no way to groove
Factory bustin' out with a brand new groove
So get on the dance floor and take control
Before I lose my soul

I wanna spend my night with you girl
I wanna spend my life with you girl
I wanna give my life to you girl
I wanna be so close to you girl
