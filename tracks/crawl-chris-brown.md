Everybody sees it's you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too

So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes
And where can love take us now
We've been so far down
We can still touch the sky

If we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no winds
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, back to love

Why did I change the pace
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face (your face)

So where are you standing now
Are you in the crowd of my faults
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance
We can still have it all

So we'll crawl (if we crawl)
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run (then we'll run)
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no winds
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, back to love

Everybody sees it's you
Well I never wanna lose that view

So we'll crawl (if we crawl)
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run, we run
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no winds
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl

So we'll crawl
'Til we can walk again ('til we can walk again)
Then we'll run (we'll run)
Until we're strong enough to jump (until we're strong enough to jump)
Then we'll fly
Until there is no winds
So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl
Back to love
