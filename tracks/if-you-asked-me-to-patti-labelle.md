Used to be that I believed in something,
Used to be that I believed in love,
It's been a long time since I've had that feelin',
I could love someone,
I could trust someone.
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin',
I said I'd never let nobody in,
If you asked me to I just might change my mind,
And let you in my life forever,
If you asked me to I just might give my heart,
And stay here in your arms forever.
If you asked me to,
If you asked me to,
So now ever since I've been around you,
Can't go back the way and on my own Can't help feelin',
Darlin', sinceI've found you,
That I've found my home,
That I'm finally home.
I said I'd never let nobody get to close to me, darlin',
I said I needed, needed to be free,
If you asked me to I just might change my mind,
And let you in my life forever,
If you asked me to I just might give my heart,
And stay here in your arms forever.
If you asked me to and I would give my world,
Little baby, I need you now,
Ask me to and I would do anything for you, baby,
For you, baby.
If you asked me to,
I'll put you in my life forever,
If you asked me to,
All you gotta do is ask me to,
If you want it I could give you my heart,
If you asked me to,
I'll give you anything that I say, baby,
If you asked me to,
I'll do anything that you want me to do, just ask me,
All you gotta do is ask me to,
If you asked me to,
I'll give my life,
All you gotta do is ask me to,
If you asked me to.
