Pack it up that, choo choo, ride on this, choo choo
And, boo, you need to stop faking, and come on with me

And I can see you wanna hide it, (c'mon), just divide it
And please don't knock it, until you ride it
So to all of you girls, you know, I'm calling your name

I can smell them tranquil breezes from a mile away
Graduated from Boone up to Alize baby
Baby, you looking tough to death
Got your weave done right, it's on so tight
Now it's on tonight, yeah, yeah
Right about now it's about that time for me to holler
Girl, I wanna waller in the back of my impala
Woo, don't need no tickets for this thing
Just jump on in, let me hit them switches on the train
And it ain't no thing, it's all the same
Get on the train tracks
Here we go, so get on the floor
And put a hump in your back
So pack your bags, come on, get ready, say what?
We're coming through your town
Move your arm up and down
And make that choo choo sound, like this

Ride that choo choo, woo woo...
Ride that choo choo, woo woo...
Ride that choo choo, woo woo...
Ride that choo choo, woo woo...
