We go by The Runners
Hol' up, hol' up, Chris Brown
This what we do, we do this


I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah (Yeah)
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do
It's what I do, hey, it's what I do


Everywhere I go they show me love so I give it back
Throw a couple stacks up in the air 'cause I'ma get it back (Oh)
See something sexy up in here, I'ma bring it back (Bring it back)
They keep on runnin' back (Runnin' back), they keep on comin' back (Yeah)
Everybody knows CB, see me sittin' in the front row, Playoffs
Stuntin' with my J's on and it's all for them haters (Yeah)
Yeah, we get into that quap, boy, my money too long, boy (Oh)
We do this for fun, boy


I be throwin' up my cash (Yeah), actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah (Yeah)
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do (It's what I do), it's what I do (It's what I do)
It's what I do, hey, it's what I do (Woo!)

Single once again, I'm 'bout to go where I never been
Gone with the wind 'cause that other ish irrelevant (Yeah)
We can get it in, I mean get it in
And I got stamina so don't forget to bring a friend
Nah, bring 10 but they gotta be tens
Now that's a hunnid them, let The Runners in (Yeah)
Yeah, swag heavy like an elephant
My CD's selling out, you ain't married to the game, you celibate


I be throwin' up my cash (Yeah), actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah (No, no, yeah)
I'm speedin' down the fast lane (Speedin' up), stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah ('Cause they can't, yeah)
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs

That's a .9 on me, that's no iPod (iPod)
You want my watch, homie, gimmie five bricks for it (For it)
I got the Maserati, I hit a lick for it (Lick for it)
When old money talk, that's when I pay for it (Pay for it, yeah)
He see a car fleet, and all 'em mine (Mine)
Four broads with me, and all 'em dimes (Dimes)
Six chains on me, and all 'em shine (Shine)
I got my bread right, feel like I'm 6'9"
Ain't just hot in mine, I'm hot in every city
