We've been here too long tryin' to get along
Pretending that you're, oh, so shy
I'm a natural man doin' all I can
My temperature is runnin' high

Friday night no one in sight
And we got so much to share
Talkin's fine if you got the time
I ain't got the time to spare

Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch me there? Yeah

Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch me there? Where? There, yeah, oh

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
My my my my my
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Every growin' boy needs a little joy
All you do is sit and stare
Beggin' on my knees, baby won't you please
Run your fingers through' my hair

My my my whiskey and rye
Don't it make you feel so fine?
Right or wrong, don't it turn you on?
Can't you see we're wastin' time?

Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch me there? Yeah

Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch? Yeah
Do you wanna touch me there? Where? There, yeah, oh

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
There, there, there
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Every growing boy needs a little joy
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Beggin' on my knees, baby, if you please
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Every growing boy needs a little toy
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

I'm a natural man doin' all I can
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Every Friday night I got to get my share
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm waiting so long, yeah
