Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around

Take me, baby
Kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do me baby
Like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more

Do me baby
Like you never done before
I want you now
I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Here we are
Looking for a reason for you to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby, please stop teasing me

What ya do
I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

So do me, baby
Like you never done before
Give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
C'mon, do me, baby
Like you never done before
I want you now
I just can't wait no more

I said oh, oh, oh, oh

Do me, baby
Do me, baby
Give it to me
Do me, baby
I want you now

Do me, baby
Give it to me
Do me, baby
Do me, baby
Don't wanna do it all alone
I want your love

Do me, baby
Give it to me
Do me, baby
This feeling is too strong
Make me wait too long
I want you now

You're leaving me no choice
Ok, what are you gonna do
You just gonna sit there and watch? alright
Are you sure you don't wanna close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not gonna stop 'till the war is over

Help me!
There, ok, ok
I'm so cold
Just hold me
