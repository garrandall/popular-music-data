White men
White men
White men
Yeah yeah
White men
To the beat ya'll
White men
To the beat ya'll

Sometimes you have to do
What you gotta do
To even out the score
Don't ever fake your game
It's not a sure thing
Hold on and get it through

Bet your bottom dollar
That you can make them holler
Don't you know that white men can't jump, yeah
And if you say it louder
Than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump

White men
To the beat ya'll
White men

White men

Don't you know that white men can't jump

Don't play me like I'm some guy
Cauz I'm not that
I can do anything that you do
I may not be from?
But I can catch anything
I realize that a man's gotta do what he's gotta do

Bet your bottom dollar
That you can make them hollar
Don't you know that white men can't jump
And if you say it louder
Than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump
Bet your bottom dollar
That you can make them holler
Don't you know that white men can't jump
If you say it louder
Than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump

Hustle like your brother
Trying to make livin
Needs the dough but where you gonna go
White men
Black men
White men respect
Black man gets the check and?
Here's the scoop they shoot hoop for loot
Go to play but don't go to stay
No matter what you do
There gunna treat you like a chump
Cauz white men just can't jump

Bet your bottom dollar
That you can make them holler
Don't you know that white men can't jump
And if you say it louder than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump

Bet your bottom dollar
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men

Bet your bottom dollar

You know you can do it
And if you say it louder
Say it louder
Than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump
