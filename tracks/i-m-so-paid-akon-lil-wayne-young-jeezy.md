Rubbing' on that Italian leather
Then Konvict jeans on!
Ayo, Weezy! You Ready? Yeah!


I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid


I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that motherfuckin' would, ‘cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me
That's why


I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid


She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house too small, I moved an extra block
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why


I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid


I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
Guess what? I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah! Akon! Weezy!
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby


I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid


Ahem, Big Money Weezy
White wife beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn, but I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Moolah, baby! That's why


I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid
