You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home


Oh my goodness
This beat is so hard
Oh my goodness
This beat is so hard
I'm a go hard
Hard to the core
Hard like mother fucking liquid...
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorean doors
Willie survive, never deceased
I don't think I'm ever gonna rest in peace
I'm a kill a gang, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my rests up peas
... I know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grandkids' nieces
I'm a work hard, that's my thesis
This beat is the shit, faeces

Pardon me maam
I'm a go dumb, small I am
I'm complicated, hard I am
I end the beginning then start it again


You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home


Oh my goodness
This beat is so hard
Oh my goodness
This beat is so hard

You can get that or you can get this
You can call a demon, I'm a call Jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work or you can be the boss
I'm a be the owner, be a thug donor
I'm a go hard like a mother fucking boner
I'm a make a beat and put them people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a Rolling Stoner

I woke up in the morning
Hard light morning, wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. on, I might phone the homeland
I'm way out like NASA
I'm way over here, I done past ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews
I go hard, statues


You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Now let me take this time to say I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it's a lot to...
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard


Hard like rock 'n' roll
Time bombs explode
Baby this is dynamo
Bring it back now
It's 'bout to blow
Hard like geology, technology
This is crazy
Psychology
Yeah baby I'm 'bout to win
What's that now, I'm going in
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
