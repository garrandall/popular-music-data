Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain


And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love


If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm


Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
Youâ€™re a saint, youâ€™re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams


And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love


If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm


I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace


Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man


Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm
