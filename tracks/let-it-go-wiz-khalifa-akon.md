Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go

(Ohh oh oh ohhh) 


Uh, all niggas know what the fuck is, man
Young Khalifa man, heheheheh... uh
I done stayed on top of my game, gained control of my lane
Paid so much for my frames, put these lil niggas to shame
Ordered so many them bottles
So many them bottles you would think I'm insane
Already changed the game once I done told you
But now I'mma do it, and now I'mma do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections
I made these lil niggas go cop they Rolexes
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Use to be the kid, now homie I'm the man
Hundred grand in a rubber band
I used to be the kid, but now homie I'm the man


Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
See through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go homie
You know they can't see what we see homie
Difference from the real and make believe homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go


Living my life about peace
Sharing this money and trying to get all my niggas
Up off of them streets
Used to look up to some niggas
But now it seem that it all come down to me
Make sure my family gon' eat
Grinding from up underneath
Now they just say I'm a, now they just say I'm a beast
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully
Cause I'm the shit, literally
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school


Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go homie
You know they can't see what we see homie
Difference from the real and make believe homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go
Let them know
Let them know, let them know


This time I feel like its now or never
Ain't going nowhere so no matter what they say
I'll be here forever
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win
Don't need to take it on the chin
Remember homie you ain't even gotta hold it in


Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go homie
You know they can't see what we see homie
Difference from the real and make believe homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go
Let them know
Let them know, let them know


ONIFC, TGOD
