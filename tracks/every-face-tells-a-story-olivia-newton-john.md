There's no need for you to tell me
I can see the way you feel
I just know without you saying
What is a lie and what's real

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

Something's going on, and I know it
You can't keep it from me
Your smile cannot hide what you feel inside
And I don't like what I see

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories

If you want to leave me, leave me
No good living a lie
You can pretend that we're not gonna end
But your eyes are saying goodbye

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories

Tell me, I got a right to know
Pour your little heart out to me, baby
You know, you know I don't want to let go

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye
