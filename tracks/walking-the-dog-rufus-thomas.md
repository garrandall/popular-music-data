My baby's back, dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tippy toes	
She broke the needle, now she can sew

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Mary, Mary, 
How does your garden grow?
Pussy cat, little bells and cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Yeah, walkin', just just just a-walkin'
Yeah, walkin', just just just a-walkin'
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Mary, Mary, 
How does your garden grow?
Pussy cat, little bell and cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Walking, walking, walking, ju-ju-ju-ju-just a-walking
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog
