Feels so real and my mind won't let go
Feels so real and my mind won't let go


It is a night I won't forget
The kind you dream of
Sweet candlelight, the mood is set
I'm ready for love
Your kiss, your sweet embrace
I'll never be the same
Are you my dream come true?
You just thrilled me so, won't let go


Feels so real and my mind won't let go
Is this my dream come true?
It feels so real and my mind won't let go
Feels so real and my mind won't let go
No matter what I do
It feels so real and my mind won't let go


So close to you and yet so far
It tears me apart
I wish you knew my happiness
Is there where you are
For you, I'll be true
And it will be the same
We kiss and on like this
Love will surely grow, don't let it go


Feels so real and my mind won't let go
Is this a dream come true?
It feels so real and my mind won't let go
No matter what I do
It feels so real and my mind won't let go (Whoa, whoa)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go


Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love
Does it seem that love is just a dream?
Give it up
Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love (Feels so real)
Does it seem that love is just a dream?
Give it up
My love is comin' on strong


Feels so real and my mind won't let go (Is it my love for you?)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go
Is this my dream come true?
It feels so real and my mind won't let go (Whoa, whoa)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go

Feels so real
No matter what I do, it feels so real, so real, so real
Feels so real and my mind won't let go


Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love (Feels so real)
Does it seem that love is just a dream?
Give it up
My love is comin' on strong


Feels so real and my mind won't let go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go
Is this my dream come true?
It feels so real and my mind won't let go
No matter what I do, is this a dream come true?
Feels so real and my mind won't let go (Oh, hoh, oh)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go (Whoa, oh, ho, ho, yeah)
Feels so real and my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)
It feels so real (So real)
And my mind won't let go
