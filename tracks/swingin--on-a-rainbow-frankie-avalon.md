You've got me swinging on a rainbow
Walking around in the rain
Playing with the raindrops
I'm doing flip flops
Look what one kiss can do

You've got me warm in the winter
Cold on a summery day
Never know the reason
Hearts out of season
Look what one kiss can do

Never thought that I would fall
To love was not for me
I wanted to be just a roaming lover
A being careless, always to be free

You've got me hooked line and sinker
Just like a fish on a hook
You better pull the line
Baby, I can't win
Look what one kiss can do

I only wanted to just
Be careless and free
And I never thought that you
Would fall in love with me

You've got me hooked line and sinker
Just like a fish on a hood
You better pull the line in
Baby, I can't win

I've got it bad
And I feel so glad
Just look what one
Just look what one
Just look what one kiss can do
