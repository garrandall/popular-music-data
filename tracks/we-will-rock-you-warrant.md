We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man some day
Got mud on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Fighting in the street, gonna take on the world some day
Blood on your face, big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Well, buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace some day
Mud on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your ass all over the place

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Sing it: We will, we will rock you
Hey, hey

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Everybody: We will, we will rock you, rock you, rock you, rock you

Hey, hey

Rock you

Rock you

We will, we will
We will, we will
We will rock you
