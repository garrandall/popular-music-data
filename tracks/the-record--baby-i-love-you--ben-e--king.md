Hello, baby
I'm in a penny arcade
Just put a quarter in now
To have this record made

I only have two minutes, baby
To tell you how much I love you
And when you hear this record playing
I hope it's clear what I'm saying


Baby (baby, I love you)
Baby, yes, I do
(Longing to kiss you)
Girl, you know I do
(Baby, I need you)
Baby, yes, I do
(Oh, how I miss you, baby)

I'm a thousand miles from home
Play this record when you're all alone
Play it low, play it and listen
Close your eyes, pretend we're kissing



A red light just went on in here
I guess that my time is up, dear
A second more to say goodbye
And say I'll always be your guy
