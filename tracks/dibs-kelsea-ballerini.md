I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?
And tell me are you trynna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:

If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love ain't afraid to break (hey)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine

Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
'Cause boy I've got to mark it
Oh
So they can all back off
Yeah
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah

If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey)
If you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break (hey)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah, I'm calling dibs

If you've got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey, if you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break
Heyyy, if you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give

I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
