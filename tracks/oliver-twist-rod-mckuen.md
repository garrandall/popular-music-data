Oliver twist yeah

You ought to see Oliver go go Oliver
You ought to see Oliver twist

He can't mow the grass
Falls asleep in grammer class
But he's a sight on Saturday night
You ought to see Oliver go go Oliver
You ought to see Oliver twist

He can't drive like Jim
Every tree bumps into him
But on the floor he makes 'em roar
You ought to see Oliver go go Oliver
You ought to see Oliver twist

He can't write a letter
'Cause he can't spell
The girls, they want to wear his sweater
To catch the eye of that a fabulous guy
He can't sing on pitch
But he's a panic with his twitch
He raises dickens with them chickens
You ought to see Oliver go go Oliver
You ought to see Oliver twist
Come on go...

He can't write a letter
The cat can't spell
The girls, they want to wear his sweater
To catch the eye of that fabulous guy
He can't sing on pitch
But he's a panic with his twitch
He raises dickens with them chickens
You ought to see Oliver go go Oliver
You ought to see Oliver twist
You ought to see Oliver twist
You ought to see Oliver twist
