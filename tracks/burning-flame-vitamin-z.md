Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

I understand that you used to love me
Nothing much but it made you cry
So here we are making pleasant gestures
And I just can't see the reason why

Me and you we never made it far girl
Now I laugh at the promises we made
And something went the first time that I hurt you
The lights went out and the memories start to fade

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

I felt the earth fall apart and crumble
All my dreams down they fell
And would an angel show mercy to the devil
But you're under my skin and you know darn well

Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame
