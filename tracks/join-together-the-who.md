{intro}

When you hear this sound a-comin'
Hear the drummer drumming
Won't you join together with the band
We don't move in any 'ticular direction
And we don't make no collections
Won't you join together with the band

{Bridge}

Do you really think I care
What you eat or what you wear
Won't you join together with the band
There's a million ways to laugh
Every one's a path
Won't you join together with the band

{Bridge}

Everybody join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band
We need to join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band

{Bridge}

You don't have to play
You can follow or lead the way
Won't you join together with the band
We don't know where we're going
But the season's right for knowing
Won't you join together with the band

{Bridge}

It's the singer not the song
That makes the music move along
Won't you join together with the band
This is the biggest band you'll find
It's as deep as it is wide
Won't you join together with the band

Ev'rybody join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band
We need to join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band

{Outro}
