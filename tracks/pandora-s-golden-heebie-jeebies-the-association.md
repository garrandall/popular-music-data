I have walked along the
Paths of dark and light
And I have seen the sunrise
And I've seen the night

I've seen the calm before
The storm and then the fight
And now I see the sparrows
As they begin to fly
And all that's left
For me to do is cry

I've had my view of happiness
And my view of despair
I've cleaned out all the cobwebs
And I've learned how to compare

I've seen all of the circles
And I've had my last affair
And now I see the sparrows
As they begin to fly
And all that's left
For me to do is cry

Thinking that I was lost
Then finding the end
To all beginnings
Gave to me the key
Made of lead and golden
Freeing locks, Pandora's boxes
Devils are expended
And I'm finally free

And when all the
Tears are finally cried
And I am finally clean inside
The gentle winds will come
And they will dry my mind

And I will see the sparrow
That need no longer fly
And all that will be left
For me to do is die
