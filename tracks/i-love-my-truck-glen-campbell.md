Well, it'll just get you down
If you let life get to you
Cause everybody's saying something
None of it's true

Well, I just don't care
When them times get hard
Cause I got everything I need
Right out in my yard


I love my truck
She's right outside
I ain't got much love
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I got my truck right by my side

You got Sally and you got Sue
And I got a Chevrolet
She takes me home after work
Don't ever miss a day

She don't care what I am
She don't care what I ain't
But she ain't no cheap pickup
She just needs a couple coats of paint


Yeah

She don't care
If I don't work a lick
She'll start every time
If the choke don't stick

I know that she will
Never doubt me
Cause she never leaves home
Without me


I got my truck right by my side, yeah
I got my truck right by my side
