You were hanging your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swaying in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've,
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me staring at you
But you smiled back at me
You started slinging that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've, 
I've had that song in my head all day


I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of the blue-eyed boy
Dancing in the bed of the two-tone Ford
Oh, Lord, is it love,
I just can't say, But I've,
I've had that song in my head all day

I said, "How 'bout an autograph
For your, your biggest fan."
You wrote your name and your number 
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumping away
And I,
I've had that song in my head all day



Playing in my head all day
