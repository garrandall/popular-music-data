I took to her, she took to me
And now we're meeting secretly
From four to five my dreams all come alive
Would she ever leave him?
I live from day to day
And if it ends I lose two friends
I can't win either way
My best friend's wife is the love of my life
I just don't know what to do about it
My best friend's wife is the love of my life
I just don't know what to do about it
We get together socially
And she's with him, she's not with me
I try to hide the way I feel inside
Goin' thru the changes
So no one can tell
They say it's heaven being in love
I'd hate to be in hell
My best friend's wife is the love of my life
I just don't know what to do about it
My best friend's wife is the love of my life
I just don't know what to do about it
