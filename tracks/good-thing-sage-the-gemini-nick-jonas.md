Yeah
And they already know me S-A-G-E

They be speaking on what they don't know
They don't know because I keep it low
When I go low she tell me, "Way to go."
I make her act up, when I come back up
She says her feelings too strong, make her wanna back up
And I respond like "Damn"
Believe me when I tell you why I agree (like damn)
An hour later it was gon' be you or me (like damn)
Now I don't wanna let you go
But there's something that you gotta know

This ain't nothing but dangerous
We about to be over it
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is
We're both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is

I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening

Said, I ain't never felt the way you make me feel
Continue so I know it's real
Think about me like I know you will
Fall for me, let it fall for me, give it all to me
Stand in the middle of the floor, throw your bra to me
This is real, yeah, this is real, let your guard down
This is good thing, ain't no time to call it off now (like damn)
Now I don't wanna let you go, but there's something that you gotta know

This ain't nothing but dangerous
We about to be over it
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is
We're both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is

I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening

We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening

We're both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can't it just be what it is
Why can't it be what it is

I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening

We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
We can make the good thing keep happening
Good thing keep happening
