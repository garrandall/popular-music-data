I need somebody
Who's consistent with me
Someone already there
When I need company

'Cause when I'm feelin' low
I don't wanna have to go out lookin'
For a part time kinda love

And when the dreams and rainbows
Start to disappear
I don't want somebody
Up and runnin' out of here

'Cause when you stop and start
Baby, it's just too hard upon my heart
That part time kinda love

I can't take you, darlin'
Livin' here, wait and see
I want somebody who's
Committed now, to me

Somewhere, someday
You've got to take a chance
If you like the music, baby
Get up and dance

If we grow together
Darin' to dream
I know we're gonna find our share of
Peaches and cream

And when the juices flow
I don't want no, no, no excuses
Just want your full time love for me
(No part time love for me)
Just want your full time love for me
