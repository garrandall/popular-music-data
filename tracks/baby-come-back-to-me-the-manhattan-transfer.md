Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty, baby come home to me

I sent my baby a telegram asking to be her man
Begging her to come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
Oh I dotted the I's and I crossed the T's
And I'm begging pretty please
Honey honey, come back home to me (Baby come home to me)

Dit dot...
Baby I want your love
Woo-oh
Baby I need your love
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)
Dit dot...
Got to have your love
Woo-oh
Can't live without your love
Woo-oh
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)

Oh I made mistakes, yes that's the truth
But the biggest one I made with you
Honey honey, come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
I thought that you would understand
I'm just a one woman man
Not like before so come back home to me (Baby come home to me)

Dit dot...
Baby I want your love
Woo-oh
Baby I need your love
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)
Dit dot...
Got to have your love
Woo-oh
Can't live without your love
Woo-oh
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)

Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Oh, ah (Baby come home to me)
I said
Come back come back to me
Come back come back to me
Come back baby come back to me
Come back come back to me
Come back come back to me
Come back baby come back to me
