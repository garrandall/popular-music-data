Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules donât apply, no
And you canât keep a good girl down

She comes through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that, shake that, money on a dime
Donât need a sugga daddy, she can work it just fine
Up on the table, sheâll be dancing all night (hee-eey)

Babydoll just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line

We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies âbout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys you gotta show a little more

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

A little bit of naughty, it's a little bit nice
Sheâs a whole lot of glam, sweat, sugar, sex, spice
Shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut
Give a little what, what
Up on the tables weâll be dancing all night (hee-eey)

Everybody just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the boys wanna fall behind

We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies âbout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys you gotta show a little more

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

Ok girls, letâs show them how itâs done
It ainât over till we say
And weâve only just begun

Lemme hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeaah, yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeaah
Say yeaahâ¦ yeah yeahâ¦

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, wonât let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
