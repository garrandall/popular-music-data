Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don’t apply, no
And you can’t keep a good girl down


She comes through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that, shake that, money on a dime
Don’t need a sugga daddy, she can work it just fine
Up on the table, she’ll be dancing all night (hee-eey)

Babydoll just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line


We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies ’bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys you gotta show a little more


Hit it up, get it up, won’t let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque


A little bit of naughty, it's a little bit nice
She’s a whole lot of glam, sweat, sugar, sex, spice
Shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut
Give a little what, what
Up on the tables we’ll be dancing all night (he-eye)

Everybody just comes to life
Under the spotlight
All the boys wanna fall behind






Ok girls, let’s show them how it’s done
It ain’t over till we say
And we’ve only just begun


Lemme hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
