It was the summer 2001
All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sitting out on your steps
You was broke down crying a mess
So I interferred
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playin games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you aint laughed in while
I was glad that I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it aint no rush
I was thinking maybe we could discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust
I just wanna talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up
Where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow


Girl I understand you're loyal to your man
And that's alright aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby
Girl you got to let him know
You can't live like this no more
Nah baby
Can't you see
Together you and me could be so special ah baby


Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talking all night please stay up but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with that drama and stress
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
You accept and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart
That I gotta mend
That's unfair
I've only been your lover and friend
And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care the life he leads
Is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friends said I was better
But you listen to them
Never like uh-uh whatever
So the next time he hurts you again
You already knew where you should've been
And that's with me




All the times
You 2way telling me
That you miss me
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Remember that
Now that you gone
It's been kinda hard
Cant think, can't sleep
Cant do nothing at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See you aint have to go through that
My baby
You could've been here right by my side
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
But
Instead, I keep on having these dreams
Waiting for my phone to ring
My baby wishing that it would be you But I know that won't come true
