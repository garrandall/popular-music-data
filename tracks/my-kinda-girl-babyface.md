First, there is no doubt
Not for a minute
You've always been my heart's
Number one and number and two
Girl, you were right there
And I won't forget it
By my side for all those nights
I had to hold on to you

If there's one thing that I know
Girl, you are my heart and soul
When I needed love indeed
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
'Til my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say

After all that we've been through
It's so nice to know someone like you
Still cares for me, baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady
And no matter what I do
I promise that I'll keep on
Loving you, pretty baby
'Cause you're my kinda lady

You're my kinda girl

Now I know
That nothin' could separate us
You'll always be my girl
I will always be your man
We go as far
As love's gonna take us
To the room of love we'll zoom
Long as we're hand in hand

If there's one thing that I know
Girl, I'll always love you so
When I needed love to be
You were always there for me

And I'll make love stay
'Til my dying day
And it really makes me feel good
Just to say



You're my kinda girl
My kinda girl
My kinda girl

I get a real good feelin'
Deep inside my soul
Girl, when you're around
I just lose control
And I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout the way I feel
Girl, you are the only one
That gives me chills
And I can't stop lover
'Cause you mean too much
Ooh I start to lose it, girl
Whenever we touch
We got too much time
And that's for sure
We need to stay together
And never let go, no

My kinda girlie
You're my kinda girl
You're my kinda girl
'Cause you're my kinda girl



You're my kinda girl
My kinda girl
You're my kinda girl
