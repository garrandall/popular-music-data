The last guest has gone
I can tell you're as thankful as I
Good time was had by all

And a little wine, I know by that look
You've got other things on your mind
And I can't resist that sign

So turn out the lights and close the door
We need the night to be alone
Shut out the world, just let it spin
Why don't we make a little bit of heaven?

Just talk to my heart
Say the words that I want to hear
Darling, tonight I need you near

So turn out the light and close the door
We need some time to be alone
Shut out the world, just let it spin
And maybe we'll touch a little bit of heaven

Shut out the world, just let it spin
Maybe we'll touch a little bit of heaven

Heaven's right here for us
We don't need a mountain to climb, no, no, no
There's just the two of us
And the love between the lines

Turn out the light and close the door
We need the night to be alone
Shut out the world, just let it spin
Why don't we make a little bit of heaven?

Turn out the light and close that door
Maybe we'll find a little bit of heaven
Turn out the light, baby, and close the door
I know we can make a little bit of heaven

Honey, turn out the light, yeah, and close the door
Maybe we'll find a little bit of heaven
Turn out the light and close the door
Maybe we'll find, a little bit of heaven
