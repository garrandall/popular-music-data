Slow dancing, it don't turn me on
I know that chicks like to boogie to the beat in the song
Cause if the beat's slow the ladies won't dance
And if they won't dance I don't stand a chance
Somebody please tell the record man
To play a disco song so the ladies will dance
Slow dancin oh how shy they can get
Chicks don't like dancin too close to
Some new dude they just met
Cause when yuou dance slow there's nothin to say
And if he comes on strong she can't get away
Somebody play some rock and roll
So I can shake and bake some sweet woman's soul
I'm lady lookin but I can't get cooking
With slow dancin, dancin

Slow dancin, it don't turn me on
I know that chicks like to boogie to the beat in the song
They like to drink slow and dance real fast
There wear their jeans so tight and wiggle their class
But when they dance slow I just can't tell
If all the moving parts are put together so well
Somebody please tell the record man
To play a disco song
So the ladies will dance
