Good mornin', mornin' glory
Good mornin', what's your story?
Good mornin', where'd you spend the night?
Where did your night dreams take you?
Sorry, but I had to wake you
Oh, I just had to make you
Shed your precious mornin' light on me, yeah

Oh, good mornin', sleepy baby
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe
I love you even more today
Every time you go to sleep
I'm jealous of the dreams
That keep you away from me

Good mornin', mornin' glory
I'd like to thank the sandman
For he let you wake up
In my arms again

Doo-bee, yoo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Oh, come on, darlin', time to get up
I have your breakfast table set up
It's such a lovely mornin' to see
'Cause I have my mornin' glory with me
I have my mornin' glory with me
