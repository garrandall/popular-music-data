I've got a secret in my heart
I've been holdin' for some time
But if I let the fire start
Would it be outta line

I guess there's nothin' left to say
I just wanna make you mine
Don't let a good thing get away
Come on and make up your mind
Yeah, give me a sign baby

Can't wait all night
Can't wait all day
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

Now the feeling's right
I just wanna say
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

I'm double parked outside your heart
While I wait for you to make a move
If nothing's keepin' us apart
We got nothin' to lose

Lovers come and lovers go
You gotta know when it's for real
Why would you wanna be alone
When you could be with me?
Yeah, you coulda been with me

Can't wait all night
Can't wait all day
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

Now the feeling's right
I just wanna say
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

I'm sittin' on TNT
Just wishin' you could be with me
A little bit of love would go a long, long way

I'm walkin' on lands mine
I'm just wishin' I could make you mine
There's nothin' left for me but anticipation

Can't wait all night
Can't wait all day
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

Now the feeling's right
I just wanna say
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

Can't wait all night
Can't wait all day
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?

Now the feeling's right
I just wanna say
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way?
