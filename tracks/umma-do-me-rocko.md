You wear Reebok, I wear Bally.
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Loui.
I drop 600 boys on these coochies.
You really like her, you might wife her.

You make is sprinkle, I make it tsunami.
You get chump change, but I get money.
You like dancin, I just two step.
You like to jack off, (uh uh uh uh) but I do that.
You don't tote guns, I keep that tooly.
Wanna see how it's done?
Watch me do me!

You just do you (and what), umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me,
Watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me,
Watch me do me, watch me do me

What's that, new Dolces? These here chrome heart.
You need a key for yours? Me, my shit auto-start.
I talk to the car, the car talk back.
Then I step up out the car, watch the car back back. (aye!)
Yo' money funny, (ha ha ha ha) my money talk.
While we talking money, look, this how money walk.
Playa why you limpin? It could be two things (like what?)...
Them fifteens or whole stacks in my blue jeans.
That's last years model, (me) I'm in that new thing. Black flips,
Black sack, call 'em shoestrings.
Aye who you with? Frank n Roll best thing since the TV.
Pay attention let me show you how to do me.

You like the fo'-door, (me) I just do two.
If you ain't getting money, nigga, I'm nothin' like you.
I'm from the ol' school, you from the new school.
My ol' school cost more than your new school.
Just got a new school, that's what I'm use to.
Suede around the panoramic equals clear view.
You in my rear view, yeah you history (skkrrrt!).
First to second, two seconds, I love a six speed.
I swag it out, uh felt my swag.
The shoes match the hat, the hat match my bag.
These niggas mad, you don't like it, nigga sue me.
Wanna see how it's done, then watch me do me.

You just do you (and what), umma do me,
Umma do me, umma do me
You just do you (and what), umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me,
Watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me,
Watch me do me, watch me do me
