You thought you had found a good girl,
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you been misused,
Talk to me, I'll do what you choose.

I want you to

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything all right

That girl you had didn't have no sense,
She wasn't worth all the time you spent

She had another man throw you outdoors,
Now the same man is wearing your clothes.

I want you to

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything all right

She would embarrass you anywhere,
She let everybody know she didn't care
Give me a chance I been begging you
I just wanna take care of you.

I want you to

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want, tell Mama
What you want right now, tell me
Tell your Mam... 
Tell your Mama, what you got to have
