Ain't it good, ain't it right
That you are with me here tonight
Music playing, our bodies swaying in time
(In time, in time, in time)

Touching you, so warm and tender
Lord, I feel such a sweet surrender
Beautiful is the dream that makes you mine

Mm, rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

Baby, baby, rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

Oh my darling, oh my baby
You got the moves that drive me crazy
And on your face I see a trace of love
(Of love, of love, of love)

Come hold me close, don't let me go
I need you, honey, I love you so
You were made for me by the stars above

Mm, rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

And baby, baby, rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

Rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

Ain't it good, ain't it right
That you are with me here tonight

Rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before

Baby, baby, rock me gently, rock me slowly
Take it easy, don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before
