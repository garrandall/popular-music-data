Yo! I'm just giving out sounds
Every day yuh get up and a frowns
A one ting mi want you know little girl
A one ting mi want yuh know say, who?


Everyone falls in love sometime
(Cho! cho!, ya betta know, you betta know)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime, it's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime
(Remember that girl)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime


Hold on!
Hey!
Question I ask
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl if your love is really really true
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl, hey!
And don't have mi like no yo-yo
If ya really love me let it flow flow
And if you don't love then let me go go
But any rude boy will let you know, know that


Everyone falls in love sometime (Cho! cho!)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime (Honey)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime


Ah ah hold on de, hold on de, hold on de
Hold on de, hold on de, hey
Beep beep, the singer got the keys to the jeep (vroom)
A we pretty gal want fi meet
So tell me what's up before mi hit in the streets
Ya see it?, ya see it?
All eight, nine, ten!
The whole a dem girl deh want fi be our friend
A you mi really love, why you want it fi end?
You have mi brains a puzzle, mi can't comprehend
But then again...


Everyone falls in love sometimes (Oh na na)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(Ball me a ball)
Everyone falls in love sometime
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime


Hey!
You want me tell you something, girl?
You want me tell you something?
Cho, girl you have me reminscing
When mi 'member 'bout you're loving and kissing
So tell me tell me girl, why you wanna be dissing
I try to talk to ya, but you're not listening
It's only natural for my love to be glistening
Baby in my heart I know there's something missing
Since lately you keep on flippin'
So listen keenly to what the singer singing


Everyone falls in love sometime
(oh, yeah, yeah)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime, not a crime, no time)
Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime


Hold on, hold on
Question I ask
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl if your love is really really true
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl eh, and no have mi like no yo-yo
If ya really love me let it flow flow
And if you don't love me let me go go
One thing di rude boy waan let you know, know


Everyone falls in love sometime (I know)
I don't know bout you but it ain't a crime (Yeah now)
Everyone falls in love sometime
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

Beep beep, the singer got the keys to the jeep
