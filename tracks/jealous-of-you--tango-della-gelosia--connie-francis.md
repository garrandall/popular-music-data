Your eyes may thrill me with gladness
And tell me you're true, dear
Yet thoughts still fill me with sadness
And what can I do, dear

I wonder if you are free
I wonder if you are free

Do you belong just to me
I'm always jealous of you, dear
I'm not to be
I am jealous of you, darling
Why am I so jealous, darling
Sad are the fancies that throng
Through my heart everyday
Lest someone else come along
Who can steal you away
All your beauty I would own
I would have you mine alone
Fear that someday we may part
Still consumes me with pain
What would become of my heart
If I loved you in vain
