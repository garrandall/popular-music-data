Step back relax and chill as I thrill
The K is back I'm not here to ill
Laying knowledge through the mic
Hype with a beat like this for your delight
Cooling in the crib writing rhymes
A pen on the paper spending times
Then up on the stage the crowd's in a rage
Taking rap to a brand new age

Psychological poems fun funky fresh
Rob'n'Raz on the cut to bring big success
Ain't down with horse ain't down with smack
I'm a flygirl packed with rap
When I grab the microphone
You better move your butt
Homeboys in the house show me what you've got
I'm Leila K on the M.I.C
Come on come with me to the place to be

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game

Go yeah wow yeah go yeah wow yeah

Rhyme devastation my obligation
When I'm in effect I shake the foundation
Stories I tell intellectually well
Fresh for 89' rocking bells
Leila K coming right and exact
Leila K ain't down with no crack
Leila K laying rap after rap
On the mic superdef
Never coming out wack

On and on the lyrics flow on
I've got soul boy and I'm coming on strong
Check the respect hard and correct
It's live and the mic is blessed
Full of stream mean on the scene
Pa Syenska fin if you know what I mean
Leila K on the M.I.C
Come on come with me to the place to be

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game

Go yeah wow yeah go yeah wow
Here's Rob 'n' Raz

Psychological poems fun funky fresh
Rob 'n' Raz on the cut to bring big success
When I grab the microphone you better move your butt
Homeboys in the house show me what you've got
Leila K coming right & exact
Leila K ain't down with no crack
Leila K on the M.I.C
Come on come with to the place to be
