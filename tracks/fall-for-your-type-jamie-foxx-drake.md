Can I, Can I 
Save you from you. 
Cause you know there's something missing 
And that champagne you've been sipping 
Not supposed to make you different all the time 
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl 
Cause with all the recognition 
It gets hard for you to listen 
To the things that Imma say to make you mine 

Like live girl, have some fun girl 
We'll be fine 
Tryin to convince myself I've found one 
Making the mistake I never learn from. 

 
I swear I always
Fall for your type (yeah) 
For your type 
Tell me why I always
Fall for your type 
For your type 
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all) 
Fall For your type 
(I just can't explain this sh-t at all) 
Fall For your type 
(I believe in people like you)


I'm tryna to figure out why 
I keep falling for men like you 
You tell me all the things that the last one said 
And you buy me all the same things too 
Everytime I feel like 
This is different 
You turn around and prove me wrong 
SMH once again 
Ohh 
I feel like I'm cursed 
Will I ever get it right
Is there someone out there for me 
Who's willing to give all I need



I don't know why I always fall for your type yeah 
For your type 
Tell me why I always fall for your type yeah 
For your type
