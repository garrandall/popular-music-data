Feeling the heat
I can't keep
The pressure off me
Hear the man say
Earn your pay
Or I'll let you go today

But that's not for me
I was born to be alive
Not livin' to survive
Come closer to me, baby
Make me believe it, I can

Own the night
Reach up and touch the light
Own the night
You make me come alive
I own the night

Here in the dark
Turn it on
Love me forever like this
Baby don't stop
Make it hot
I want to taste your burn again

Take me away
To a place I've never known
Livin' right down to the bone
Closer to me baby
Make me believe it, I can

Own the night
Reach up and touch the light
(Love still shines)
Own the night
You make me come alive
I own the night

You make me feel
I own the night

Own the night
Touch the light
(Love still shines)
Own the night
