So I come to play the love in New York
Where it was covered in snow, what a time to show
Still said it was new to me
And it was good to be there
It was like a fantasy
Though I was in it going to California
The music business is in L.A.
And the money is there, they say
So I packed my bags again
And we came into L.A.
To see the warmer day than we had seen in New York
Like I'd come to stay
I met a friend of mine who took me on home
And I heard her say, she said

Honey, no, don't leave L.A. you're just a lonely driver
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
She said now, honey, no no no don't leave L.A.
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
Honey, don't leave L.A.

After hitching a ride into Hollywood
Just to see the famous scene I understood
Spent the nights with the girl that I knew
I knew that I was getting to know
With all the things we knew
So I got into her and she got into me
Ooh we was living out of money, you know
I got a feeling that came right through to me
When that woman took me by the hand
And she said

Honey, don't leave L.A. you're just a lonely driver
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
She said now, honey, no no no don't leave L.A.
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
Honey, don't leave L.A.

And she said Honey, no, don't leave L.A. you're just a lonely driver
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
She said now, honey, no no no don't leave L.A.
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
And I heard hear say Honey, don't you leave L.A.
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
Honey, don't leave L.A.
Honey, don't you ever leave L.A.
