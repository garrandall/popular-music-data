Love is the grooviest thing up 'til now in the world

It's a happening thing
This love that flows within the heart of me
It's a happening thing
The world and you become a part of me

Tell me you love me
I will understand
Tell me you need me
Take me by the hand

This is the first time I have felt this way
Love is the grooviest thing up 'til now in the world

It's a happening thing
I never thought that I could feel this way
It's a happening thing
And now I know this feeling's here to stay

Tell me you love me
I will understand
Tell me you need me
Take me by the hand

- Interlude -

This is the first time I have felt this way
Love is the grooviest thing up 'til now in the world

It's a happening thing
This love that flows within the heart of me
It's a happening thing
The world and you become a part of me

Tell me you love me
I will understand
Tell me you need me
Take me by the hand

This is the first time I have felt this way
Love is the grooviest thing up 'til now in the world
It's a happening thing
