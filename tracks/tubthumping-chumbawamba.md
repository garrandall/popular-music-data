Truth is I thought it mattered
I thought that music mattered
But does it? Bollocks
Not compared to our people matter

We'll be singing
When we're winning
We'll be singing

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away
Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink
He drinks a vodka drink
He drinks a lager drink
He drinks a cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind of the better times

Oh, Danny boy
Danny boy
Danny boy

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissing the night away
Pissing the night away

He drinks a whiskey drink
He drinks a vodka drink
He drinks a lager drink
He drinks a cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

Don't cry for me
Next door neighbor

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing)
You're never gonna keep me down (When we're winning)
I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing)
You're never gonna keep me down (Oh-oh-oh)
I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing)
You're never gonna keep me down (When we're winning)
I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing)
You're never gonna keep me down (Oh-oh-oh)

I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing) (Pissing the night away)
You're never gonna keep me down (When we're winning)
I get knocked down
But I get up again (We'll be singing) (Pissing the night away)
You're never gonna keep me down (Oh-oh-oh)
I get knocked down
