We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
"Get a job, you fucking slob" is all he replies


God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)


Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said. "Don't worry about a thing, baby doll
I'm the man you've been dreamin' of."
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, "Goddamn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls!"
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!


God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)


I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad
And the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon
Drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green

I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start


I knew this kid named Max
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late at night
Liked to get shit faced
And keep pace with thugs

Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way
At least that's what they say
When you play the game


God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
To have to lose...
