Darlin' don't go
And leave me all by myself
I don't think
I can make it without you
Well I know it was wrong
To ever treat you that way
Will I promise, I will never do it again

Lord I know what they say it's true, baby
I could never live one day without you
Please come home
My heart is on the floor
When I walk in circles over you

All I know is I was wrong
To ever treat you that way
Well I'll promise I will never do it again

Lord I know what they say it's true, baby
And I could never live one day without you
Please come home

I say
Darlin' don't go
(Darlin' don't go)
And leave me all by myself
I don't think
(I don't think)
I can make it
(I can make it)
Oh I don't think
I don't think I can make it
No, I don't think, baby
I can make it
Without you
