My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he`s a fine man
And he`s mine, all mine

Whenever I need him
He`s always around
I don`t have to go
Searching all over town

He treats me nice and
He loves me every day
I`ll tell the world
That I`m proud to say

My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he`s a fine man
And he`s mine

He`s home at night
I fix his food
He`s worked all day
He`s in a tired mood

I cuddle him up
I give him a kiss or two
I`m willing and able for
Whatever he wants to do

Because my man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he`s a fine man
And he`s mine, all mine

My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
Mine, mine

His heart is made of gold
His words are heavenly
I feel like an angel
Every time he touches me

So, give him up, no
That would never work
And if you girls fool around
Somebody`s gonna get hurt

Cause my man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he`s a fine man
And he`s mine, all mine
Yes, he is, now

My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he`s a fine man
And he`s mine, all mine
Yes, he is, girl
