Made it through my situation; ain't I blessed as I can be?
Ain't I laughing at you haters trying to take a shot at me?
They don't know which way to go; I'll make it easy; follow me

Ain't I so, so superfly? Boy, ain't nobody hot as me
Ain't T.I. all on tv when he wake up and go to sleep? (Ain't he?)
Everywhere, they notice me, and for yourself just go and see
My community I'm serving, though they hope I don't succeed
Hear me speak, they so intrigued
"Ayy, ain't he snitching?" No, indeed
You come with that common flow
Your show, I have to commandeer
Since I see you can't take over, I'll just have to volunteer
Ayy, ain't I your superior? Listen here, bruh: you not a peer
I'm so Zone 1 that it ain't funny, twice the G that I appear
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear, gon' be gone for bout a year
So Paper Trail you gotta hear, but ain't that "Ain't I" outta here? Ayy!


Ain't I? (Ain't I?) Ain't I? (Ain't I?)
