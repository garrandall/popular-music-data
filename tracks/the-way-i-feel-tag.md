Love

Love

Love can come and go
You can change your mind
Many times
Say you just don't know

Giving my heart and my soul
Pleasure comes with pain
I'll be here forever
Don't break my heart again

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight
Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
(I know I'm crazy but I'm)
Falling in love with you

Love can come and go
You can change your mind
Be unkind
And say you love me so

Finding a love today
All I get is pain
I'll be here forever
Don't make me cry again

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight

Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
(I know I'm crazy but I'm)
Falling in love with you

You can take me for granted
(Treat me like a fool)
Make me lose control
(Lose control of you)
Don't make me lose that feeling
So tell me
Why do I feel this way?

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight
Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
(I know I'm crazy but I'm)
Falling in love with you

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight
Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
(I know I'm crazy but I'm)
Falling in love with you

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight
Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
(I know I'm crazy but I'm)
Falling in love with you
