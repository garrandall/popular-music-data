When you meet someone
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not
If a flame should start
As you hold him near
Better keep your heart

For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go
Then what will you do
When he sets you free
Just the way that you
Said goodbye to me
