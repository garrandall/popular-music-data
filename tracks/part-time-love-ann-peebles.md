I need somebody
Who's consistent with me
Someone already there
When I need company

'Cause when I'm feeling old
I don't wanna have to go
I'm looking for
A part time kinda love

And when the dreams and rainbows
Start to disappear
I don't want somebody
Up and running out of here

'Cause when you stop and start
Baby, it's just
Too hard upon my heart
That part time kinda love

I can't take you, darling
Living here, wait and see
I want somebody who's
Commited now to me

Somewhere, some day
You've got to take a chance
You can write the music, baby
Get up and dance

If we grow together
Daring to dream
I know we're gonna find
Our share of peaches and cream

And when the juice is flowing
I don't want no, no, no excuses
Just want your full time love for me
(No part time love for me)
Just want your full time love for me
