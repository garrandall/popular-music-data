You!
With your masquerading
And you
Always contemplating
What to do
In case heaven has found you
Can't you see
That it's all around you
So follow me

Hey come on, babe
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at

Come on, babe
Can't you see
I'm the Pied Piper
Trust in me
I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at

{Hook}

Girl!
Don't be scared to move
Hey, babe
What are you tryin' to prove
It ain't true
That your life has kicked you
It's your mind
And that's all that's trickin' you
So step in line

Hey come on, babe
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at

Come on, babe
Can't you see
I'm the Pied Piper
Trust in me
I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at

Come on, babe
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at

Come on, babe
Follow me
Come on, babe
Trust in me
Come on, babe
Can't you see
Come on, babe
Follow me
I'm the Pied Piper
