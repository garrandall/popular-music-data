Stop
Let's take this real slow
Let me break it down
So that you can know

I'll do things
You never imagined me to do
I'll lick you all over
As the sweat
Pours down on you

Girl I want
To lick you up and down
Come on and let me do
What I can do

Come on
And tell me what you need
Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body
Let me


Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
Come on let me lick you around

Up and down
You will feel my fire
Let me lick

Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down

It'll be right
It'll be right
Come on


Every little touch that I make
Will be so nice, girl
{You know what I'm gonna do}
Lady, lady, lady, lady

First
I'll start from your toes
And then I'll make my way to your thighs
I'll make you so wet
That you will never let me go

How about we get to know my boy Shazam
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm feelin G.I

Dino will make you feel the things
That will make you
Feel so right
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all night)

Girl
I want to lick you
Up and down
Come on and let me do

What I can do baby
Come on
And tell me what you need, girl
'Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body


Come on and let me lick you up
(Come on and talk to me)
Come on and let me lick you down

Come on
Come on, baby
Let me know what you want
And I'll just do it

Come on and let me lick you up
I'm a real man babe
(Let me do it to you)

I'm so real, baby
Come on and let me lick you down
Yeah, baby
(Don't you know, baby)


I've said all I'm gonna say
So come here
Lay your body down
Right here

Cause it's on
It's on
It's on, it's on

Wooh
Oh, I

Come on and let me lick you up
Know that I got you where I want you)
You're laying here with smiles on your face)
Is it good to you?
I know
It's good
I just don't have to ask


Come on and let me lick you up
(But I'll make it better)
Come on and let me lick you down

(Me, myself)
Myself, baby
Give, give, give
Give a little more licking to do, baby

Come on and let me lick you up
(I know I'll make it so right)
Come on and let me lick you down
I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll
I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll
I'll make it so right
