Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I cannot see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
Played with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy
I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love is here
When you are loving me
I had to live, I had to live
I had to leave, I had to leave

If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around

I was wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I transformed days into nights
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights better times better days
But I miss you more and more

If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, oh, pretty wings, oh
Pretty wings, oh, pretty wings, oh
Pretty wings around

Baby

Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around...
