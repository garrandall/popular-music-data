I was cruisin' in my stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
And rolled down the window of his shiny new jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag
I said, "you're on, buddy, my mill's runnin' fine
Let's come off the line now, at sunset and vine
But I'll throw you one better if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way
To dead man's curve"

Dead man's curve, it's no place to play
Dead man's curve, you best keep away
Dead man's curve, I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from dead man's curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should of heard the whine from my screamin' machine
I flew past LaBrea, Schwab's, and Crescent Heights
And all the jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there I was
At dead man's curve

Dead man's curve, it's no place to play
Dead man's curve

Well, the last thing I remember, doc, I started to swerve
And then I saw the jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right
Won't come back from dead man's curve

Dead man's curve, it's no place to play
Dead man's curve, you best keep away
Dead man's curve, I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from dead man's curve
