Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine.
Takes forever getting ready.
So, she's never on time 
For anything.

When she gets that come-get-me
Look in her eyes,
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives 
Me wild.
But she drives me wild.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She makes plans for the weekend,
Can't wait to go out
'Til she changes her mind.
Says, "Let's stay on the couch 
And watch TV."
And she falls asleep.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She's unpredictable, unforgettable.
It's unusual, unbelievable.
How I'm such a fool!
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy.
She's crazy.
She's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.
Her crazy is beautiful to me.
