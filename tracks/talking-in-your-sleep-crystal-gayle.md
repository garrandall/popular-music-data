Three o'clock in the morning
And it looks like it's going to be another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams and getting very low
Wondering what I can do

Maybe I'm being foolish 
'Cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep with loving on your mind

Maybe I'm being foolish 
'Cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep with loving on your mind

You've been talking in your sleep
