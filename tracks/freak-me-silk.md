Freak me, baby (Ah, yeah)
Freak me, baby (Mmm, just like that)
Freak me, baby (Ah, yeah)
Freak me, baby


Let me lick you up and down till you say stop
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot
Let me do all the things you want me to do
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you


Baby, don't you understand
I wanna be your nasty man
I wanna make your body scream
And you will know just what I mean (You know what I mean)
24 carat gold
To warm the nights when you get cold
I wanna lick you up and down (Baby, yeah, baby, yeah)
And then I wanna lay you down, come on Silk sing


Let me lick you up and down till you say stop (Lick you up and down)
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot (Let me make you real hot)
Let me do all the things you want me to do (Whoa)
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you


I love the taste of whipped cream (Hey)
Spread it on, don't be mean (Baby, don't be mean)
You know I can't resist you, girl
I'll fly you all around the world (All around the world, oh, baby)
I wanna see your body drip
Come on let me take a sip (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Take off what you cherish most (come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
Cause when I brag I like to brag and boast


Let me lick you up and down till you say stop (Lick you up and down, oh, baby)
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot
(I wanna play with your body, baby, I wanna play with your body, girl)
Let me do all the things you want me to do
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you


You, you, you, you (Oh, you)
You, you, you, you (Let me freak you)
You, you, you, you (All of you)
Yeah, come on, come on
You, you, you, you (Oh...you)
You, you, you, you (Let me do you)
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you


Let me lick you up and down till you say stop (Freak me, baby)
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot (Freak me, baby)
Let me do all the things you want me to do (Freak me, baby)
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you

(Baby, don't stop) Let me lick you up and down till you say stop (Baby, don't stop)
Let me play (Baby, don't stop) with your body, baby, make you real hot (Hey)
Let me do (Baby, don't stop) all the things you want me to do (Baby, don't stop)
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky, freaky

(Let me lick you up and down) Let me lick you up and down till you say stop (Up and down)
Let me play with your body, baby (Up and down), make you real hot
(Let me make you soakin' wet, baby)
Let me do all the things (Oh) you want me to do
(I won't play around with your love, baby)
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you
