Give me heartaches, scold me
Give me cause to hurt again
Hear me well now
(I can't be blamed)

(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands
(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands

(And come out crying)
Â Crying
(Come out crying)
Crying

Crying enemy

Give me sadness, bring to me
Give me credit for not being any good
One more teardrop
(From the heart)

(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands
(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands

(Come out crying)
Crying
(Come out crying)
Crying

Crying enemy

(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands
(Let's shake hands)
Shake hands

(Come out crying)
Crying
(Come out crying)
Crying

Crying enemy
