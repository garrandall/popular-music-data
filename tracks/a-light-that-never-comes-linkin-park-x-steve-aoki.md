Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more.
'Cause I know what its like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate.
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it so long, so long
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A King can only rein 'till instead
There comes that day, it's of his head.
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
And I told them; nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more, some more
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes!
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
