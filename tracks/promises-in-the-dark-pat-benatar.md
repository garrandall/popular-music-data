Never again, isn't that what you said
You've been through this before
You swore, this time, you'd think with your head
No one would ever have you again
And if takin' was gonna get done, you'd decide where and when

Just when you think you got it down
Your heart securely tied and bound
They whisper promises in the dark

Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night
But too many opponents made you weary of the fight
Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in
All the warnings went off in your head, still you had to give in

Just when you think you got it down
Resistance nowhere to be found
They whisper promises in the dark

But promises you know what they're for
It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before
'Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure
And so you put up your guard
And you try to be hard but your heart says try again

You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear
No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears
Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost
On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the cost

Just when you think you got it down
Your heart in pieces on the ground
They whisper promises in the dark
