The very first time
That I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "Hello"
And I said "Hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up
In physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a phase
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
Oh
Yeah, baby, yeah
Ma-ma, ma-my, ma-my
I swear next time she'll be my friend
If I say that I can be your one and only
(Promise, promise) Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need
Oh baby
I just wanna be the one who serves you
Sometime I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
(My friend)
Very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
(My friend)

And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
