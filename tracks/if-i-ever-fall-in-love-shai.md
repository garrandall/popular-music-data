Shai... coming right back at ya baby
Part 2
Remix... Ooooooh
If I ever fall in love again
The next time the lady will be
Just like you


The very first time
That I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "hello" and I said "hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up
In physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a friend


And if I ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is
A friend
And if I ever fall
In love so true
I will be sure that
The lady's just like you... ohhh


Yea, Baby yea,
My, my, my, my, my, my
I swear the next time she'll be my friend


If I say that I can be your one and only
Promise that you never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need (oh baby)
I just wanna be the one to serve you
Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you
I'll cherish every moment that we share




Hey baby I made a Promise
The next time I fell in love,
That my love would also be my friend
Somebody who would be there
Thru the thick and thin (Oooooh)
To love me, to hold me
Comfort me, somebody who could be
There all thru the night
Somebody just like you


My Friend...
Very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in...
