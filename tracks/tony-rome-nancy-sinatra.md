Mothers lock your daughters in
It's too late to talk to them.
'Cause Tony Rome is out and about
And Tony Rome'll get 'em
If you don't watch out.
Tony Rome'll get 'em
If you don't watch out.

Pussycats out run a stray.
He will bring them back today.
Cause Tony Rome is out and about.
And Tony Rome'll find 'em
If you don't watch out.
Tony Rome'll find 'em
If you don't watch out.

Love is for those who have the time to
Rome is for those who are inclined to.

Ladies' hearts adore diamond rings
Are not the very special things.
When Tony Rome is out and about.
'Cause Tony Rome'll take 'em
If you don't watch out.
Tony Rome'll take 'em
If you don't watch out.

Love is for those who have the time to
And Rome is for those who are inclined to.

Ladies' hearts adore diamond rings
Are not the very special things.
When Tony Rome is out yeah and about.
'Cause Tony Rome'll grab 'em
If you don't watch out.
Tony Rome'll take 'em
If you don't watch out.
Watch out!
