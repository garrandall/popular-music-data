Lookin' like another Bob-Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon

We've got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda smoked 'em all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon

Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doing this 'til six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

Get up and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon

Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doing this 'til six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

Get up and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

We get up, we go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

Don't wanna a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends

We barely get by
But have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down
So we can do it all again

It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't living on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt
I'll figure out
Just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doing this 'til six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

Get up and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

We get up, we go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

Just kickin' around, hanging out this afternoon
Sitting around hanging out this afternoon
Last call, you sons of bitches
Just kickin' around, hanging out this afternoon
Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon
Drinks on the house
Just kickin' around, hanging out this afternoon
Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon
