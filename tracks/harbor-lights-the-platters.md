I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me

I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
"Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me"

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
"Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me"
