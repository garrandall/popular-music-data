Call, call my name
Call it, call my name


I've heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you
Through the bridal path door
And ever since that day I haven't wanted, anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth, that I


I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do


I heard a voice on the news saying
People want to stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside


I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do


I've never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down


I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do


I love it when you call my name
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name
