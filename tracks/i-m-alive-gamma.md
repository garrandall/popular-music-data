Did you ever see a man with no heart
Baby that was me
Just a lonely, lonely man with no heart
Can you set me free? I can breathe, I can breathe
I can see, I can see
I can touch, I can touch
I can feel, I can feel I can taste the sweetness of your kiss
You show me all the things I ever missed I never felt like this
I'm Alive, I'm Alive, I'm Alive Well I used to think I was livin'But I was wrong
No, I never knew a bit about livin'Until you came along I can breathe, I can breathe
I can see, I can see
I can touch, I can touch
I can feel, I can feel I can taste the sweetness of your kiss
You show me all the things I ever missed I never felt like this
I'm Alive, I'm Alive, I'm Alive Well I used to think I was livin'But I was wrong
No, I never knew a bit about livin'Until you came along I can breathe, I can breathe
I can see, I can see
I can touch, I can touch
I can feel, I can feel I can taste the sweetness of your kiss
You show me all the things I ever missed I never felt like this
I'm Alive, I'm Alive, I'm Alive
I'm Alive, I'm Alive, I'm Alive
