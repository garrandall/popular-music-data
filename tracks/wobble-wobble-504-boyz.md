Yo', this Jay-tweezie keeping it live for the heezie
For cheezy with them 504 Boyz you dig, check it
This here is to played loud as possible
Preferably in residential neighborhoods and night clubs
Grab your shorty and let's go



Now won't you wobble wobble
Let me see you shake it, shake it
Now won't you drop it, drop it
Ohh, take it, take it 


You already know what's happenin' when I step in this bitch
And I know you've heard of me, cause I'm right there off of GT and (?)
You've been 'bout serving it, every since you heard my song
I got you bucked up, you want that camouflage love, huh
You got me fucked up
I just want to see you wobble, like your momma's won that lotto
Like your daddy full of that bottle
Like your brother when he caught them hollows
Like them GT bitches, them sank these riches, them No Limit bitches
Them boss bitches who 'bout they riches, and it ain't no secret
They want that soldier dick that you only get from that soldier clique
That Whoa! bitch I told ya' dick, 'welling up
We drop it like it's hotter, from the dance floor to the Ramada
Giving up them peso's, I thinks nada, look 




Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wootay, my man locked up)
Everytime you wobble wobble it gets me horny
So I can ride that ass from the night until in the morning
I could respect your mind, if you could respect the game
Is it cool to fuck, or is this about some change




I like it when I see 'em at the club, shaking that thang
Girl you really got me thinking 'bout taking that thang, come here
Now when they wobbly, wobbly, ass bouncing everywhere
The way she drop it like that, I can't help but to stare
Got a nigga saying "Ohhh girl"
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that
The way you bounce it and shake it, you know I'm with that
I'm trying to get that, cause you got me rock hard
Ohh my God, got me humpin it, humpin it, huh, humpin like a dog, woof




Back your ass, Whoo, the fuck up
I thought I told you, put your meanest face on for me
And them steel-toe boots, gonna stomp your ass
Want it, hunt it, some old niggas ready to jump your ass


I'll be there for you baby, just beep me
Start paging soldier, when you want a freak male
I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you


Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked
You lick your lips it makes me hard, 
daydreamin' of screamin' and fiendin'
You creamin' for sex, that you gonna get this evening
Ya' heard me



We them 504 Boyz, huh, we them 504 Boyz
