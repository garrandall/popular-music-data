There was a love
Once upon a time
A fairy tale
Her heart was blind, blind, oh
He lived for her
So happily ever after
I turn the page
The story fades as I call your name
(It makes me so)

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go
Baby, this can't be you

Hello, my love
What's going on, on, uh?
Tell me, baby
Aren't you gonna prove them wrong, wrong, uh?
I hear your name
It's not the same, boy, they're saying things
Is this a game?
Am I insane?
No, this can't be real
(It makes me so)

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go
Baby, this can't be you

I swear I can hear it in us
You know, come, baby please
I've taken so long to, to know you
You just tell me
And I believed you
Because I loved you
And true love is so hard to find
You look so beautiful in my eyes
I love you so much, I love you, darling

I trusted you
You gotta let me know

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go

(I'll never know, I'll never know)
(Never my love, my love, oh baby)
Baby, this can't be you
(I'll never know, I'll never know)
(Never my love, my love, oh yeah, baby)
Baby, this can't be you

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go

I hear whispers at night
That you're seeing somebody new
I can't believe it's true
Baby, this can't be you
But if there's someone else
Baby, then let me know
I never thought I'd
Ever have to let you go
