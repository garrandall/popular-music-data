Oh, shit, you live in the Canyon
How big is your mansion?
Fresh outta school now you workin'
And focused on fashion
Pretty girl and you let go
Got time but you got goals
Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at a 1Oak
La la la la la
Now we at the same house party
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time, baby
Waste your time with me
In California

Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

Oh, shit, you born in the Hamptons
I heard that's expensive
Damn, and you famous on Insta'
Your pictures are blessings
I think you could be a centerfold
No need for the money, though
Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at a 1Oak
La la la la la
Now we at the same house party
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time, baby
Waste your time with me
In California

Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California

Uh, I'm a Californi-n-I-g-g-a
Fuck with me, girl, I look like bae
My grass is greener, girl
Without no snakes
Them other niggas fulla games
Girl, this not no prank
Just broke up with your man
It's the right time
We throwin' money at a stripper
That's the right vibe
I come alive at night time
She said all she really wanna do is fuck
I said, "Likewise"
I like you on top like cilantro
You like it in your mouth like blanco
I run the city 'come fuck with a Pablo
I want you, not the code to your iPhone
Straight player
Your friends said don't fuck with me
Straight hatin'
Wastin' time in Cali', I ain't really wastin' time
'Cause if you meet a ball player, that's a come-up, right

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at Coachella
La la la la la
Why you actin' like you don't remember?
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time, baby
Waste your time with me
In California

Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California
Hey, baby, waste your time with me
In California
