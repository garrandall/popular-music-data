(I'll remember you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?

(I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you, you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you
I'll remember you, you)

Hey, what's your name?
Hey, what's your name?
'Cause I, I need to know
(Need to know)
'Cause I, I need to know

I've been high and I've been low
Far beyond and far below
Never seen you before
If I die before I wake
Promise me you'll remember me tomorrow

'Cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause...

(I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you, you)
Do you think you're better off alone?
(I'll remember you
I'll remember you, you)
