Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!


If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard


Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!


We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (whatâ€™s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door


Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!


C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!


Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)


I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)


Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!
