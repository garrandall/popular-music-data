There's a reason
For the life that you live
And there's pleasing that
I know you can give

And I been craving
The love you been saving
So, baby
Won't you give it to me?


You're telling me no, no, no
You don't want to let your love go
I'm telling you yes, yes, yes
You really oughta be getting some happiness


I made a motion
And it's out on the floor
And it's a notion that I'd love to explore

Cause I been tasting
The love you been wasting
So, baby
Won't you give it to me?


You're telling me no, no, no
You don't want to let your love go
I'm telling you yes, yes, yes
You really oughta be getting some happiness


You're a lady
And I'm here in the palm of your hand
Such a lady
How much more do you think I can stand?


You're telling me no, no, no
You don't want to let your love go
I'm telling you yes, yes, yes
You really oughta be getting some happiness

You're telling me no, no, no
You don't want to let your love go
I'm telling you yes, yes, yes
You really oughta be getting some happiness
