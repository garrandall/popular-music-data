Someone, someone's done you wrong
You thought that
Your love was strong
Now you're feeling like
Such such a fool, poor you

You're thinking
Maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool

Oh, but it's all right (all right)
Once you get past the pain
(Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

Sometimes we all
Feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new
Yes, you do

Your dreams feel like
They're falling apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid
To be true to yourself

Whoa, but it's all right (all right)
Once you get past the pain
(Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
(Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Yeah, so now don't
Don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through again

Yes, 'cause it's all right (all right)
Once you get past the pain
(Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
(Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

It's all right (all right)
Once you get past the pain
(Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
(Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way, oh

Yes, it's all right (all right)
Don't be afraid
'Cause it's all right (all right)
Yes, it's all right (all right)
Keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way
