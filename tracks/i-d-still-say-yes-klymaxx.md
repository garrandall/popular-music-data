I love you most when we share a place
Those special good times together
It seems like our love, can't get much better (No)
'Cause we were as close as two could be
We knew love could last forever
We're more than just lovers, we're good friends
And even if our love has drifted away
I wouldn't even think twice if I wanted love back again


Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin', for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin', for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Say yes, oh)


Where does it go, how does it end?
True love, it seems so easy
'Cause we have no doubts
Where we belong (Where we belong)
They say time can heal a broken heart
True love never ends
So why not start where we began?


Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin', for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin', for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Say yes, over and over)
(Hey, say yes, say yes, oh)


They say time can heal a broken heart
True love never ends
So why not start where we began?
(Let's start where we began)


Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin', for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin', for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Over and over, say yes, say yes, oh, girl, say yes)
Say yes to you again
Darlin', for you, I'd do it over and over again (Say yes, oh)
