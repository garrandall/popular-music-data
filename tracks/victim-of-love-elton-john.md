You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Lying, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me
Is this a game are you just playing
Will I be losing you

Oh am I a victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only using me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

My friends warned me about you
I laughed, how could I doubt your love
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be
So now, this was a game you were just playing
And now I'm losing you

Oh I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only using me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you've made of me
