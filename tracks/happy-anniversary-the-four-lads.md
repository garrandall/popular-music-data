Here's to you
Here's to me
Here's to a
Happy Anniversary

Here's to days gone by
And those that are to be
Oh, here's to a
Happy Anniversary

And if I have my way
One day a long
Time from now
I'll say

Here's to you
And here's to me
And here's to
A Happy Anniversary

And if I have my way
One day a long
Time from now
I'll say

Here's to you
And here's to me
And here's to a
Very happy Anniversary
