There's an overtone, I can feel it
When you're near me, that's so appealing
You're always makin' my imagination
Think about you, in fascination

Don't wanna be alone and thinkin' 'bout the two of us
You've got to tell me if this tendency is amorous
Magnetic fields are pulling me in your direction
And if you take me there, I'll make you no objection

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can't wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it

When we're together, something radiates
My heart first skips a beat, and then accelerates
It must be something, to do with fusion
But I let you draw your own conclusion

We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meaning
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leaning

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can't wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it

If you feel it, If you feel it
If you feel it, If you feel it

Love can wait
Feel it, Feel it
Satisfy

We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meaning
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leaning

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it

If you feel it, If you feel it
If you feel it, If you feel it

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it

If you feel it, If you feel it
If you feel it, If you feel it
If you feel it
