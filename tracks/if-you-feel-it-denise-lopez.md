 I was talking to a friend of mine
 Ah-ha, and what he say?
 He said a lot of people don't think but
The love you take is the love you make
 Well you know that's true
 So somebody said once

(The love you take)
Open your heart up to business
Undress the way you feel inside
Don't you know your acting out the motions?
Expressing what your missing in your life

No one escapes those changes
But it doesn't give the right to decide
How we should treat each other
Judgement day itself will arise

The love you take
Is equal to the love you make (the love you make)
And the love you make
Is deeper than the love you take
The master faith
Will stop you if too much you take
Oh-oh

I tried to share a little kindness
Show you what's behind my eye, hmm-mm
I know the past will come and haunt the future
Can you say you never told a lie?

The clock is ticking faster
As we move closer into the light
But there's still time to discover
What it is that makes it alright

The love you take
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make (the love you make)
And the love you make
Is deeper than the love you take

But it's never too late
To change the things that are not right
It's never too late
For the past to haunt you in the night

Woah-woah-woah, you're bad, bad boy
You're a bad, bad boy, that ain't good
Woah-woah-woah, hit another crown
What goes up must come down
Woah-woah-woah, you're bad, bad boy
You're a bad, bad boy, and that ain't good
Woah-woah-woah, hit another crown
What goes up must come down (down, down, down)

Woah-woah

The love you take
Is equal to the love you make (the love you make)
And the love you make
Is deeper than the love you take

The clock is ticking faster
We move into the light
We will in time discover
What is the thing that's right

The love you take (the love you take)
Is equal to the love you make
And the love you make
Is deeper than the love you take

The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
And the love you that make
Is deeper than the love you take
