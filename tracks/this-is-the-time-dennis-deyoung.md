If I knew back then
All the things I know today
Baby I would not have changed on hour
'Cause I learned so much
From my mistakes

All the nights we cried
And we prayed we'd see the morning light
We never thought that we could ever make it
And you were sure
You'd never hear me say

This is the time
This is the moment
We've waited so long
Just to be standing here
We had a dream
We made it happen
Nobody believed that we could get this far
And now I know that this is our time

You never wanted any fortune or fame
You said "Baby just give me your heart"
And now I'll tell you
Without any shame
That you were right from the start

Staying together, it ain't easy
In a wold that changes so fast
But take a look around
Our feet are squarely on the ground
'Cause we've found a love that can last

And it seems so clear
I know that this is going to be our year
We'll forget about the pain and sorrow
And we'll forget about the times we failed

This is the time
This is the moment
We've waited so long
Just to be standing here
We had a dream
My God it happened
Nobody believed that we could get this far
And now I know that this is our time
