If you take a life, do you know what you'll give
Odds are, you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me 
By the merciless eyes I've deceived

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize; it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die

The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name

If you come inside, things will not be the same 
When you return to the night
If you think you've won
You never saw me change 
The game that we have been playing

I've seen this diamond cut through harder men
Than you yourself 
But if you must pretend
You may meet your end

Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize; it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?

The coldest blood runs through my veins

Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel
(Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel 
(A spin of the wheel) 

Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize; it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you ready to die

The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name
(You know my name) 
You know my name
(You know my name) 
You know my name!
You know my name!
You know my name!
