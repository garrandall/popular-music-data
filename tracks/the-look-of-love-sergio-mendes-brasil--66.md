The look of love is in your eyes
A look the time can't disguise

The look of lo... ove
Is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look the time can't erase

Be mine toni-ight
Let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
Don't ever go
(Don't ever go)
