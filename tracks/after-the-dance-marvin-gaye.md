Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby


I want you, oh
I want you
And you want me
So why can't we
Get together after the dance


All right, oh
(Looking girl, saw you smile)
When I first saw you
(Looking good on Soul Train)
You were looking so, so good
(Oh, I was looking, too)
Oh, I was looking at you
(Sweet and so fine)
Sweet and so fine
(Freak that she was)
What a freak thing
(Tantalizing)


And I thought to myself
(Oh, on the floor)
She was so into her space
(She started to dance, would she)
So caught up in the time and the place
And I wondered would she want me
(Ah, wonder if she, she'd go for me)
If she knows what she needs is me


Oh, yeah
(Talk while we play records, girl)
We could play so, so sweet
(Look so fine, move next to me)
Come on over. Baby, move closer to me
(Your brown eyes, love for a while)
I love your smile, stay a while
Oh, Baby (I just got flashes)
I feel something (That you're wanting me)
Something in me


Oh, nobody else, girl
They'll be talking all night
(Can we leave sweet love. Baby)
Why did the morning come so soon
Love don't need time (Girl)
To make up its mind
(Satisfy) That's how I feel
(All the love inside of me. Baby)
How could you, Baby
(What you going to do)
