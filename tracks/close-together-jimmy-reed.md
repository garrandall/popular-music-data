We gotta stay close together
We gotta stay close together
If we don't somebody could
Get ahead of us

You know that this old world
Is full of toil and sin
One little person just can't win
Take it to the? side by side
To try to keep each other
From being taken for a ride

We gotta stay close, close together
We gotta stay close, close together
If we don't somebody could
Get ahead of us

We gotta stay close together
We gotta stay close together
We gotta stay close together
We gotta stay close together
If we don't somebody
Could get ahead of us
