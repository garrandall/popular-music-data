There's a whole lot of girls
Messin around
Trying to get me

They do things cause they know
My girl is away
They try to upset me

They can't believe I resist
How can I hold out,
Where is that girl now
But the truth really is
I don't worry cause I love you baby so, That...


No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
Til my baby comes home
If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin
Head gets to achin
Is she thinkin of me
Or feelin the fire
With some other guy, yeah
I can't believe I can be
Worried about her
I should'ntdoubt her
Cause our thing is for real
And I don't worry
Cause I know, I know, I know



Bring it on
Home to me
She makes everything alright, shes
Good to me
Shes the best part of my life
Can't you tell
That I'm just like a new guy, I'm doing
Very well
Cause I know shes coming back tonight

Every night when I sleep
I dream of my baby
Shes such a lady
Then I wake up and see
That shes laying by me
Right there beside me
I can't explain how I fell
I really love her, keep dreaming of her
Cause our love is for real
And I don't worry
Cause I know, I know, I know
