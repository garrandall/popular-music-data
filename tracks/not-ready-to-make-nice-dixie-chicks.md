Forgive, sounds good
Forget, Iâm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But Iâm still waiting

Iâm through with doubt
Thereâs nothing left for me to figure out
Iâve paid a price
And Iâll keep paying

Iâm not ready to make nice
Iâm not ready to back down
Iâm still mad as hell and
I donât have time to go round and round and round
Itâs too late to make it right
I probably wouldnât if I could
âCause Iâm mad as hell
Canât bring myself to do what it is you think I should

I know you said
Canât you just get over it
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I donât mind sayinâ
Itâs a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That theyâd write me a letter
Sayinâ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over

Iâm not ready to make nice
Iâm not ready to back down
Iâm still mad as hell and
I donât have time to go round and round and round
Itâs too late to make it right
I probably wouldnât if I could
âCause Iâm mad as hell
Canât bring myself to do what it is you think I should

Iâm not ready to make nice
Iâm not ready to back down
Iâm still mad as hell and
I donât have time to go round and round and round
Itâs too late to make it right
I probably wouldnât if I could
âCause Iâm mad as hell
Canât bring myself to do what it is you think I should

What it is you think I should

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, Iâm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But Iâm still waiting
