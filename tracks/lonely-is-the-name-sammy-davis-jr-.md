Lonely is the name
That I answer to
And crying is the game
Since I'm losing you
I'll never be the same
Without your love

Believe me...

Sorry is the role
That you make me play
Tormented is the soul
That is mine today
I'm lost beyond control
Without your love

Missing is the kiss
Absent is the sigh
Gone - the look of love
You wore
Was it all a dream?
Was it all a lie?
Don't you love me
Anymore?

Just tell them...

Lonely is the name
It will always be
And crying is the game
Till you're back with me
I'll never be the same
Without your love
