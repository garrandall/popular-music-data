Tonight's the night
That you belong to me
Tonight's the night
There'll be no company

Oh, tonight, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Yes sir, oh, yes, it is
Now listen to me, honey

Someone should call
Don't answer the phone
Somebody knocks on the door
Tell 'em we're not home

I just want it to be, darling
Nobody but me and you, honey, tonight

I don't want no friends around
There's a whole lot of sweet talk, girl
I'm gonna be putting down
Cut off the stereo
Forget about the late, late show
'Cause tonight, honey, oh, tonight

Listen to me
(Tonight's the night)
And when the lights are low
(They you belong to me)
I'm gonna lock all the doors
(Tonight's the night)
And throw away the key, baby
(You're mine exclusively)

And then I wanna talk to you
Some more because tonight
I got something I want to say to you
Honey, tonight, oh

I wanna hear you say I do
And that ain't all, sugar
And when I get through

I want you to hold me, squeeze me
With all of your might
Because tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
Tonight is the night
