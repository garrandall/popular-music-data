Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colors
You have in your mind
I'll show them to you
And you'll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

Until the break of day
Let me see you make him smile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

His clothes are dirty
But his, his hands are clean
And you're the best thing
That he's ever seen

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

Why wait any longer
For the world to begin
You can have your cake
And eat it too

Why wait any longer
For the one you love
When he's standing, standing
Standing in front of you

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the
Night is still ahead
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

I long to see you
In the morning light
I wanna reach for you
In the night

Please, lady
Please, lady
Stay while the
Night is still ahead

Stay, lady, stay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lady
Keep your shoes off, lady
Relax yourself awhile

Stay, lady, stay
Lay, lady, lay
Stay, lady, stay
Relax yourself awhile
Lay, lady, lay

Stay, lady, stay
Relax yourself awhile
Lay, lady, lay

Lay, lady, lay
Lay, lady, lay...
