What... like eight for the chorus?
(Oh yeah, we could do eight for the chorus)
Another 16? Aight, I'm wit it
(Aight) Aight, let's do it

Sorta like P. Smith and E. Sermon
Determined to get back to business
Evaporated them egos, now here we go
Jacob and Deen is the team amigo!
Never placebos, we're the real drug in your blood work
Back in the booth, vocals over dub work
Domestic, international hectic
Hardcore eclectic - we all that
Formats, dipped in adderall - so focused!
Not trying to be the had-it-all old who sold broke
It's all we talk about, we about stayin
The saying is First Serve's back - get to prayin!

Yo, left stranded scars and no Band-Aid
Man-made like Jaws of fantastic
Elastic bucks Stretch to Armstrong
We back like fuck threats and car bombs
Two jet liners, into buildings
Misguided but fought the feeling
Eye of the tiger plus stripes and spangle
Lettin loose raps like mic chords and tangle

We pledge allegiance to serve y'all the best
Solemnly swear to cook it up with the zest
Them other chefs be no contest
Come on get out the kitchen!
Here in the flesh...

We be the top chefs! - Servin it
The top chefs - servin it...

At the scream of the pistol, it becomes crystal clear
(Deen and Pop) in the front, never the rear
Cardio kings accustomed to the sweat
And hard work that get good ain't good as it gets
(Like an old school vet) I know beats and breaks
Like a new school threat, I know the heat that makes them HITS
(Body blows) Get 'em blown to bits and pieces
(And missing!) Like Lee patch jeans with creases
Mission objective: make beats that's effective
I find some like a detective
Time to get the most selected (been), rhyme perfected (been)
Going to the booth and have them rhymes ejected
(Another word for spin)

So self superb word poetic individual transmit
Pen-chiseled architect, cravin the hand smith
Bandana wrapped before 2Pac
Witnessed the two poppin D-Dove givin the fever
Slim pickings like you a believer
Trashed out and you the retriever, and he and I neither
To damnation with it if we leave it to Beaver
Trustin old money is like Afrika Bam Bam
The history is long here mister (well, Van Dam!)
Clockwork and how you not work a pot worth
Diapers on another hot birth, it's First Serve

We pledge allegiance to serve y'all the best
Solemnly swear to cook it up with the zest
Them other chefs be no contest
Come on get out the kitchen!
Here in the flesh...

We be the top chefs! - Servin it
The top chefs - servin it...
