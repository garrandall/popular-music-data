We don't serve your country
Don't serve your king
Know your custom, don't speak your tongue
White man came took everyone

We don't serve your country
We don't serve your king
White man listen to the songs we sing
White man came took everything

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

We don't serve your country
We don't serve your king
Know your custom don't speak your tongue
White man came took everyone

We don't need protection
Don't need your land
Keep your promise on where we stand
We will listen we'll understand

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

We carry in our hearts the true country
And that cannot be stolen
We follow in the steps of our ancestry
And that cannot be broken

Mining companies, pastoral companies
Uranium companies, collected companies
Got more right than people
Got more say than people

Forty thousand years can make a difference to the state of things
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart
The dead heart lives here
