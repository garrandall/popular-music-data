The perfect words never crossed my mind
Cause there was nothin' in there but you
I felt every ounce of me screaming out
But the sound was trapped deep in me
All I wanted just sped right past me
While I was rooted fast to the earth
I could be stuck here for a thousand years
Without your arms to drag me out

There you are standing right in front of me
There you are standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close, cause I need you to guide me to safety

No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever

In the confusion and the aftermath
You are my signal fire
The only resolution and the only joy
Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes

There you are standing right in front of me
There you are standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close, cause I need you to guide me to safety

There you are standing right in front of me
There you are standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close, cause I need you to guide me to safety

No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever
No, I don't wanna wait forever
