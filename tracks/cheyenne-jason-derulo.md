I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did

But I just can't stop
Thinking about you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Cheyenne

Got the table set for two guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again, I was dreaming
I still believe that night we shared was something sacred
I'm tryna clear my head

But I just can't stop
Thinking about you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Cheyenne
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Cheyenne

Cheyenne
Cheyenne

No, I can't stop
Thinking about you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Cheyenne
Cheyenne
Cheyenne
