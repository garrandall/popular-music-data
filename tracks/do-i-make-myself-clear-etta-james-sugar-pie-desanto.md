I don't wanna believe
The bad things about you, oh, no, now
'Cause if they're true
I'll have to get along without you, oh, ooh, now

I said the word, the sound on you Lord, yeah
It's all about the things you do

Moving and a grooving
Using and a fooling
Chasing around, every skirt in town
If it's true, you'll be on your way

Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself clear?

I said, you're gonna have to
Stop and check yourself, oh, yeah, now
I'm not gonna have a man
That's got somebody else, oh, no
Oh, you tell him now, girl, now, now

So if you're running around, baby
Thinking of putting me down, you're wrong
Taking away what belongs to me
Giving to her when I'm in need
If it's true, you'll be on your way

Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself clear?

I said, do, do I, do I make myself clear?
Do you understand me?
Do, do I, do I make myself clear?
Oh, you better listen to her now

Oh, yeah, ohh, yeah, now
Oh, oh, oh

So why won't you try to do
Something to change it, yeah, yeah
And make me know it's not
The way they claim it, oh, yeah
Now let me tell you something

All I wanted you to be true, honey
Love me like you say you do, oh, yeah
And I won't care for what they say
Instead, I'll turn my head and walk away
But if it's true, you know what to do

Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself clear?

I said, do, do I
Do I make myself clear?
And oh, oh, oh, yeah, now
Oh, oh

I said do, do, do, do
Do I make myself clear?
