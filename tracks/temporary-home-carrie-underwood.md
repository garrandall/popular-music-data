Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that'll never be home

When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face,

"This is my temporary home,
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms
That I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home."

Young mom on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl,
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world."

This is our temporary home,
It's not where we belong
Windows and rooms
That we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

Old man, hospital bed.
The room is filled with people he loves.
And he whispers,
"Don't cry for me. I'll see you all someday."
He looks up and says,
"I can see God's face."

This is my temporary home,
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms
That I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

This is our temporary home
