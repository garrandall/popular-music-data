I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(No, señor)

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(You make me feel so good)

(No, señor)
(You make me feel so good)

Now when I wake up in the morning
You know you make my temperature rise
You're like a summer breeze
You got me begging please
Can you see it when you look in my eyes?
(No, señor)

So you think you can handle my body?
But do you think you can handle my mind?
I'm thinking you and me
A pure fantasy
I can give you, baby
More than a sign

Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame
Just call my name
Yes, I got what you need

Any place you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(No, señor)

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(You make me feel so good)

Now when I wake up in the morning
You know exactly what I got on your mind
Touch me anywhere
Because you know I don't care
So come on, baby
Work me all through the night
(No, señor)

So you say that you can freak my body
I know you think that you control my mind
But baby, soon you'll see
That you are owned by me
My decision was for you to be mine

Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame
Just call my name
Yes, I got what you need

Any place you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(No, señor)

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(You make me feel so good)

(Did you say tango?)

(No, señor)
(You make me feel so good)
(No, señor)
(You make me feel so good)

Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame
Just call my name
Yes, I got what you need

Any place you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me
Pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(No, señor)

I can't get, no
I can't get, no
I can't get you out of my mind
(You make me feel so good)
