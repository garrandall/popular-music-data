(Welcome one, welcome two, welcome every one of you)

Welcome all new lovers (welcome, welcome)
To the land of love (land of love)
New lovers here you'll find the happiness
That you've been dreaming of

Welcome all new lovers (welcome, welcome)
It's so fabulous (fabulous)
New lovers, when you gave your heart away
That made you one of us

New lovers, you've passed (you've passed the lovin' test)
You gave (you gave your very best)
Until (till then you really care)
For someone somewhere

All the stars are twinklin' (twinklin', twinklin')
In the sky above (sky above)
They're sayin' "Welcome all new lovers"
"Into the land of love"

New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
New lovers (welcome, welcome)
