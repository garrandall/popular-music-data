Once on a warm and magic night
We danced as stars shown bright
Up in the midnight blue
And I gave my whole heart to you
Funny you don't recall my name

It's still the same as on that night
Not long ago
When you said that you loved me so

Remember (remember)
Remember yeah (remember)
Remember, remember me baby

I was the guy who walked you home
And when we were alone
I kissed you and you swore
You never felt this way before
Funny you don't recall my face
When my embrace meant so much
On that night we met
You told me that you'd never forget

Remember (remember)
Remember yeah (remember)
Remember, remember me baby

I was the guy who was
So much in love with you
That I caught you day after day
And now we've met again
And I don't know what to do
There's so much that I feel
And there's nothing I could say

But remember (remember)
Remember please, remember
Remember me baby
Remember (remember)
Remember me baby oh oh oh oh
Remember (remember)
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!
