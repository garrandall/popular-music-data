My love is warmer than a smile   
My love gives to every needing child   
If anyone should ask you who's my true love   
Tell them my love true is ever letting all their love come through   

My love sees love with not a face   
And lives to love through time and space   
If all of everything about my love fits to the tune of you   
Then you can say that you are my love too   

Let my love shine throughout the world   
To every mountain top and steeple   
Let it be felt by every soul   
'Til love's all over   
Let it reach out to every heart   
To every disenfranchised people   
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over   

Our love sees love's the key to peace   
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased   
Should you or anyone you know enough to say they feel as we   
Then let our universal song be free   

Let our love shine throughout the world   
To every mountain top and steeple   
Let it be felt by every soul   
'Til love's all over   
Let it reach out to every heart   
To every disenfranchised people   
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over   

Say words of love to all we see   
To rich or poor for love is equal   
Let us lift up humanity   
Spread love all over   
Let all its forces join as one   
So to rebuke all signs of evil   
Through every valley, land and sea   
Our love's all people
