I talk to you but its not the same as touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong


Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And its drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be
holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could
I know
I can't take this much longer, its so hard on my soul



Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then, will I be satisfied
I'm missing you now
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong
