Hey-ay Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything depends on you
Oh, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Bring her back to me and make my dream come true

When I said goodbye to my love
I didn't mean to make her cry
I didn't realize that I'm no good alone
Now I need her by my side

So hey Mr. Dream Merchant everything depends on you
Oh, hey Mr. Dream Merchant bring her back to me
And make my dream come true

You should have told the spoon to stop it
You should have made this blind man see
I've got my pride back in my pocket
Oh won't you bring her back to me

Hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Oh everything depends on you
Oh, hey, Mr. Dr. Merchant
Can't you make her see how much we need each other?
I'm no good alone, I really really love her
Bring her back to me, and make my dream come true
Oh yeah
