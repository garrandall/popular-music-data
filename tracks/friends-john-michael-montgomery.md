You say you want to be friends
That's a newly sharpened blade
That's a dagger to the heart
Of the promises we made
That's a chapter full of pain
A season full of rain
A dark and stormy night
Spent all alone

Friends
Get scattered by the wind
Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end
Friends
Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you
Now and Then
But you wanna be
Just friends

You say you love me very much
And you'll always hold me dear
Those are the sweetest words
I never want to hear
What's a love without desire
A flame without a fire
Can't warm me late at night
When I need you most

Friends
Get scattered by the wind
Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end
Friends
Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you
Now and Then
But you wanna be
Just friends

Friends
Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you now and then

Darling can't you see
This is killing me
We could never be 
Just Friends
