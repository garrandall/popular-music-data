Hey, Little Cobra
Don't you know
You're gonna shut'em down
I took my Cobra down to the track
Hitched to the back of my Cadillac
Everyone was there just a waiting for me
There were plenty of Stingrays and XKEs
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Hey, little Cobra
Don't you know
You're gonna shut'em down
When the flag went down
You could hear rubber burn
The Stingray had me going into the turn
I hung a big shift and I got into high
And then I flew by the Stingray
I waved bye-bye
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Hey, little Cobra
Don't you know
You're gonna shut'em down
Around the far turn
In the straight-away
I was blowing off everything
That got in my way
The Stingrays and Jags
Were so far behind
I took my Cobra out of gear
And I coast to the line
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Spring little Cobra
Getting ready to strike
Spring little Cobra
With all of your might
Hey, little Cobra
Don't you know
You're gonna shut'em down
Shut'em down
Shut'em down
Shut'em down
Shut'em down
