Since the first day I ever layed my eye
Upon your face

And since the time you gave me your tiny hand
I knew I wanted to be your man

And I been thinking
I been thinking of you
Ha ha, I just wanna know if you been thinking about me girl
You been thinking of me
I know it was a long time ago but I want to know
I been thinking of you
Ha, I just wanna know if you, you been thinking about me too
You been thinking of me

Now I know it's been about a year since I kissed you
On your face
But I want you to know I remember the feeling that day
And I want to feel it that same way
But I gotta let you know, yeah

I been thinking about it
That I been looking
I been thinking about it
And I been searching
I been thinking about it
And I been walking
I been thinking about it
And I been talking
I been thinking about it
And also stalking
I been thinking about it
In my mind
I want you to know
I been thinking

That I been thinking
I been thinking of you
I just want to know today, are you thinking girl
You been thinking of me
When it gets late at night I wanna know

I been thinking about it
In my mind

I been thinking of you
And everything that crawls around my home
You been thinking of me
See sometimes I even wanna call the police, ya see
I been thinking of you
And put out a APB and try to find you, try to find you baby
You been thinking of me
Ya know sometimes I want to call America's Most Wanted
I been thinking of you
'Cause you most wanted in my life
You been thinking of me
Yeah, yeah, and I'm just thinking about you
