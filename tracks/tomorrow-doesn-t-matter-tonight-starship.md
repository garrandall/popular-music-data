You already made up your mind
Just who you're looking for
And what kind of love you'll find

Holding out for a dream
But I can see you're lonely
Living isn't only a fantasy

I don't fit into your plans
But you can reach for my hand

Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight
I'm holding you and it feels so right
I know you didn't plan it this way
Let yourself go if you want to stay
It's all right 'cause
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight

Really hate to see you confused
I want no promises
So what have you got to lose

When you look in my eyes
Don't think about tomorrow
This feeling isn't meant to be analyzed

Why should you be all alone
'Till your heart finds a home

Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight
I'm holding you and it feels so right
I know you didn't plan it this way
Let yourself go if you want to stay
It's all right 'cause
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight

(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight)
(Tomorrow)
Let yourself go
(Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight)
(Tomorrow)

Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight
I'm holding you and it feels so right
I know you didn't plan it this way
Let yourself go if you want to stay
It's all right

Tomorrow doesn't matter at all
I'm holding you and it feels so right
I know you didn't plan it this way
Let yourself go if you want to stay
It's all right
Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight
Tonight
