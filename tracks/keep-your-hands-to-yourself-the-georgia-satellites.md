I got a little change in my pocket goin' jingle-ingle-ing.
Wanna call ya on the telephone--baby, give you a ring.
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing,
Always no huggy, no kissy till I get a weddin' ring.

My honey, my baby dont't keep my love upon no she
She says "Don't give me no lines and keep your hands to yourself.

Now baby, baby, baby why you wanna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy I still feel the same way.
That's when she told me the story 'bout free milk and a cow.
She says "No huggy, no kissy till I get a weddin' vow.

My honey, my baby dont't keep my love upon no shelf.
She says "Don't give me no lines and keep your hands to yourself.

Well I wanted her real bad, I was about to give in.
That's when she started talkin' about love, started talkin' about sin.
I said "Now honey I've been a waitin' for the rest of my life.
She says "No huggy, no kissy till you make me your wife.

My honey, my baby dont't keep my love upon no shelf.
She says "Don't give me no lines and keep your hands to yourself.
