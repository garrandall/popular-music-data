It's been a long time
I didn't ever think I was
Going to see you again
See you haven't changed
It's good to see you anyway

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain

When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You'll stay on my mind

(Special feelings, special time)
Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other

(All the good I won't forget)
You will stay on my mind
(Saturday, the day we met)

For always and for ever
You will be my Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain

When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind

(Special feelings, special times)
Feeling so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other, girl

(All the good I won't forget)
Staying on my mind, girl
(Saturday, the day we met)
Girl, you know I can't leave you behind

There's never any question
You will be my Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

When I look at you
Special feelings, special times
I thought we'd always be together
But sometimes things just
Don't work out like we planned

Life goes on and people grow
Out of things that fit before
But Saturday remains the same
And I hope it'll never change

For always and forever
You will be my, you will be my
You will be, be my Saturday love
Let's sing it together

Never on Sunday, Monday's too soon
Tuesday and Wednesday just won't do
Thursday and Friday, we can begin
But our Saturday love will never end, sugar
