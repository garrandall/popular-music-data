When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon
Is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me


So, darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me


If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountain should crumble in the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me


So, darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
