You'll never lose me
I'll always be true
And I'll never stop wanting you

I'll stand beside you
When your dreams fall through
And I'll never stop wanting you

Your kiss will always thrill me

In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much

Tomorrow as it does today

So don't worry, baby
Whatever you do
'Cause I'll never stop wanting you

Your kiss will always thrill me
In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much
Tomorrow as it does today

So don't worry, baby
Whatever you do
'Cause I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop wanting you
