They call, they call me the fat man 
'cause I weigh two hundred pounds. 
All the girls do love me 
'cause I know my way around. 

I was standing, I was standing on the corner 
Of Rampart and Canal. 
I was watching, watching. 
Watching all Creole gals. 

I'm going, going, goin' away 
And I'm going, goin' to stay 
'cause women and bad life 
They're carryin' this soul away.



Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin' just for you
Need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me?
Eenie meenie and miney-mo
Told me you'd'n't want me around no more
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love, you yes I do
And I'm saving all my lovin' just for you
Eenie, meenie, and miney-mo
Told me you'd'n't want me around no more
Woo-ee baby, woo-oo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me



I'm walking, yes, indeed 
I'm talking 'bout you and me 
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me 

I'm lonely as I can be 
I'm waiting for your company 
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me 

What're you gonna do when the well runs dry 
You're gonna run away and hide 
I'm gonna run right by your side 
For you pretty baby, I'd even die 

I'm walking ... 

I'm lonely ... 

What're you gonna do when the well runs dry 
You're gonna sit right down and cry 
What're you gonna do when I say "Bye-bye" 
All you're gonna do is dry your eyes 
I'm walking ...



I got a whole lotta lovin' for you
True true love for you
I got a whole lotta lovin' for you

A got a whole lotta (kiss, kiss) for you
A got a whole lotta (kiss, kiss) for you
I got a whole lotta kisses for you

A got a whole lotta (clap, clap) to do
A got a whole lotta (clap, clap) to do
And I'm so glad to see you

I got a whole lotta lovin' for you
True true love for you
I got a whole lotta lovin' for you

A got a whole lotta (kiss, kiss) for you
A got a whole lotta (kiss, kiss) for you
I got a whole lotta kisses for you

A got a whole lotta (clap, clap) to do
A got a whole lotta (clap, clap) to do
Cause I'm so glad to see you



I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
Tell my love is true
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said
Let the four winds blow
Let it blow and a-blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best
Let the four winds blow
Let it blow and a-blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
Tell my love is true
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said
Let the four winds blow
Let it blow and a-blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best
Let the four winds blow
Let it blow and a-blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best



And I'm ready, I'm willing and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
I'm ready, I'm willing and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
Come on pretty baby, 
We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll until the broad daylight 

Because I'm ready, mmm, 
And I'm able, mmm. 
I'm willing and I'm able, 
So you'd better come and go with me. 
We're gonna rock and roll til tomorrow 'bout three. 

Talking on the phone is not my speed. 
Don't send me no letter, cause I can't read. 
Don't be long, cause I'll be gone. 
We'll go rock and rolling all night long. 

Cause I'm ready, I'm willing, and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
I'm ready, I'm willing and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
Come on pretty baby, 
We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll until tomorrow night. 

Talking on the phone is not my speed. 
Don't send me no letter, cause I can't read. 
Don't be long, cause I'll be gone. 
We'll go rock and rolling all night long. 

Cause I'm ready, I'm willing, and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
I'm ready, I'm willing and I'm able to rock and roll all night. 
Come on pretty baby, 
We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll until tomorrow night



So long, don't where I'm going 
But so long, you know you done me wrong 
So long, because I know I'm not the one 

Goodbye, please tell me why 
Goodbye, you always make me cry 
Oh why, why are you never satisfied 

 

So long, I'm all packed up and on my way 
So long, you'll need me some ol' sunny day 
So long, yes I'm, I'm going to stay
