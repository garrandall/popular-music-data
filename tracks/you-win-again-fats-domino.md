The news is out, all over town
That you been seen, out runnin round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin you, was my great sin
What can I do, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Jest trustin you, was my great sin
What can I do, you win again
