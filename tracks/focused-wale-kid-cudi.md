Shawty, no joking
And Iâm hoping, if not slowing
Gotta just keep on rollinâ

Iâm joking (homeboy moving fast)
And Iâm hoping (praying that I donât crash)
(All I know is) Iâm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

Moving fast
And Iâm hoping, praying I donât crash
All I know is Iâm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused


Pulling up once, Iâmma lit mine up
Fill up the plug, let me light my blunt
And I donât really know what the fucks in my cup
But a couple shots of it got a nigga unstuck
Iâm just here to have a good time
A lil white chick, a lil white wine
Outta town, spent a couple nights at chows
Smoking weed in the suites, til we out of towels
And donât bother me, high shit for my broccoli
Fly shit for no goddamn reason and Yaâll aight but yâall not like me
Itâs MMG and that's my clique
That's BOA see that's my set
MY CDG shit match my kicks
An apostrophe Iâm behind that S
Or that Black beemer, black to pick me up
Back wood, the tree Iâm ashing out?, Iâm kickin my raps good
With or without sales Iâm killing these blackheads my rap is Noxema
haha, light it up for a nigga, one or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga
Redberry everywhere got Puff gettinâjealous




One night love, Iâmma need that
He could own that, shawty, Iâma lease that
Iâma put you in the game where your kicks at
Iâmma sign that work and release that
I donât be where the crowds or police at
I just be where the cash and the freaks at
Smoking Green Bay nigga, Iâm a cheesehead
In a Lambo, see me with the Gâs at
$10K in my camos, word. 10 Js and I canât move
Shades.. LV was a little dough
Going hard for the days I was piss poor
And go hard cause I feel itâs only right to
Maybach. G.O.O.D music, the right move
Girls say everything that I write smooth
Fuck rap, Iâm getting pussy off of Haiku
One time for the girls with the right shoes
Fuckin with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right back
If itâs right tonight, I might bite that
3 times, show me your peace sign
Not with your hand girl, open your knees out!
Look, money will leap out, tuntin when we out
Double MG, OUT!
