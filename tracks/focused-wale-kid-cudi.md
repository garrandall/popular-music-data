Shawty no jokin'
And I'm hopin'
'Cause I'm not slowin'
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Maybach Music


I’m jokin' (Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused
(Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused


Only live once, I'ma live mine up
Fill up the cup, lemme light my blunt
I don't really know what the fuck's in my cup
But a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
I'm just here to have a good time
A little white chick, a little white wine..
Out of town, spent a couple nights at TAOs
Smoking weed in the suite 'til we out of towels
And don't bother me, high as shit from my broccoli
Fly as shit for no goddamn reason
And y'all aiite - but y'all not like me
It's MMG and that's my clique
That's BOA, see that's my set
CDG shit match my kicks
An apostrophe I'm behind that S
Or the black Bimmer back to pick me up
Back wood, the tree I’m ashing out
See I be kicking my raps good, with or without sales
I'm killing these blackheads, my rap is Noxema
Light it up for a nigga
One or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga
Red Berry everywhere, got Puff getting jealous


I’m jokin' (Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused
(Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused


One night love: I'ma need that
He could own that, shawty, I'ma lease that
I'ma put you in the game where your cleats at
I'ma sign that work then release that
I don't be where the crabs or police at
I just be where the cash and the freaks at
Smoking Green Bay nigga, I'm a cheesehead
In a Lambo, see me where the G's at
$10K in my camos
Word. 10 Js and I can't move
Shades: LV was a little dough
I'm going hard for the days I was piss poor
And go hard 'cause I feel it's only right to
Maybach, G.O.O.D music: the right move
Girls say everything that I write smooth
Fuck rap, I'm getting pussy off a Haiku
One time for the girls with the right shoes
Fuckin' with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right bag
If it's right tonight, I might bite that
3 times, show me your peace sign
Not with your hand girl
Open your knees out!
Look, money what we 'bout
Stuntin' when we out
Double M-G - out!


I’m jokin' (Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused
(Young boy movin' fast)
And I’m hopin' (Pray that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowin' (Hmmm)
Gotta just keep on rollin'
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused
