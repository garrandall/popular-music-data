One, two, three, four


Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look

Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color
Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look


She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look


Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look

Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
And kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look


She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Ow!

Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasted like a raindrop
She's got the look


And she goes
A-na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
She's got the look


She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look

What in the world
Can make you so blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la


Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
She's got the look

She goes

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
She's got the look

She's got the look
She goes

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
She's got the look

She's got the look
She goes

Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
