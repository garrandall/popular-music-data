Hey mister bartender, mix me a drink
I really need something to tell me it's okay not to think
Because I've been to all these bars and I've seen all these places
I've hit on all these girls, I've heard the same conversations
Cab driver, cab driver, take me away
'Cause I already know all the words that she'll say
And I'll be creeping out the window at the first sight of day
'Cause every single night it seems to go the same way


I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu
I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu


Mister bartender, you will kick me out
And the blond girl in the back, you'll put your tongue down my mouth
And the greaser in the jacket's gonna pick a fight
And they'll probably kick my ass 'cause I'm drunk every night
Officer, officer, tell me the truth
How many times can I get in trouble with you
Before they lock me up for all the bad things that I do?
But you don't and that's why this feels like déjà vu


I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu
I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu


I did it like this
I did it like that
And it always comes back around
I don't know how to break this pattern down
I did it like this
I did it like that
And it always comes back around
I don't know how to break this pattern down


I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu
I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu (woah)
This is déjà vu
