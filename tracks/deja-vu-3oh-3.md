Hey, Mr. Bartender mix me a drink
I really need something to tell me it's okay not to think,
Because I've been to all these bars
And I've seen all these places.
I've hit on all these girls
I've heard the same conversations.

Cab driver, cab driver
Take me away,
'Cause I already know
All the words that she'll say.
And I'll be creepin' out the window
At the first sign of day,
'Cause every single night it seems to go the same
Way.

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

Mr. Bartender,
You will kick me out.
And the blonde girl in the back
You'll put your tongue down my mouth.
And the greaser in the jacket's
Gonna pick a fight.
And he'll probably kick my ass,
'Cause I'm drunk every night.

Officer, officer
Tell me the truth,
How many times can I
Get in trouble with you;
Before they lock me up
For all the bad things that I do?
But you don't
And that's why this feels like dÃ©jÃ 
(Ooo this feels like dÃ©jÃ  OW)
Vu.

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

I did it like this,
I did it like that,
And it always comes back around.
I don't know how
To break this pattern down.
(Down, down)

I did it like this,
I did it like that,
And it always comes back somehow
I don't know how
To break this pattern down.
(Down, down, down, down)

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

I think I've been here before,
I think I've run into you,
I know the things that you do,
'Cause this is dÃ©jÃ  vu.

(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
(Whoaa)
This is dÃ©jÃ  vu.
