Hey
Uh huh huh
Hey
Uh huh huh


What I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
You wanna come over tonight, yeah


Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
Cause it's true
That's what I like about you


What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance, yeah


Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
Cause it's true
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
Wow

Hey


What I like about you
You keep me warm at night
Never wanna let you go
Know you make me feel alright, yeah


Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
Cause it's true
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
