Wake up to the blue sky
Grab your shades and let's go for a ride
Breakfast by the ocean
We'll do lunch at Sunset & Vine

Every day's a dream in California
Every night the stars come out to play
Wish that I could always feel this way

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Oh, it's so right

There's something about the sunshine
There's something about the sunshine

In Hollywood we're rocking
In Malibu we hang out and chill
It's all about the shopping
From Melrose to Beverly Hills

Everywhere's a scene, and now we're in it
I don't wanna paint this town alone
Oh, no
When I see you smile, I always feel at home

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
L.A.'s breeze with the palm trees swaying
Oh, it's so right

Now that you're here
(now that you're here)
It's suddenly clear
(it's suddenly clear)
Sun's coming through
I never knew
Whatever I do, it's better with you
It's better with you

Kick it

There's something about the sunshine, baby
(there's something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
(whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time baby (baby)
Oh, it's so right (it's so right)

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
(a whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Oh, it's so right

(something about)
There's something about the sunshine, baby
(sunshine, baby)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
L.A.'s breeze with the palm trees swaying
(out of this world)
Oh, it's so right (it's so right)

There's something about the sunshine
There's something about the sunshine
