Sunshine:
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure;
Sometimes, I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live

Whoa
Oh

Don't wanna live by myself
By myself
Anymore

By myself
Anymore
Whoa
