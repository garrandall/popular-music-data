Singing to the world
Its time we let the spirt come in
Let it come on in
I'm singing to the world
Everybody's caught in the spin
Look at where we've been
We've been running around
Year after year
Blinded it with pride
Blinded it with fear

But its daybreak
If you wanna' to beleave
It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
Say its daybreak
If you 'll only beleave
And let it shine,shine,shine all around the world

Singing to the world
What's the point of puttin' it down
There's so much love to share
I'm singing to the world
Don't you see it all comes around
The feeling's every where
Where we've been closing our eyes
Day after day
Cover in clouds losin' our way

Hey but its daybreak
If you wanna' to beleave
It can be daybreak
Ain't know time to grieve
And its daybreak
And if you only beleave
And then let it shine,shine,shine all around the world

And its daybreak
If you wanna' to believe
It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
And its daybreak
And if you only believe
Then let it shine,shine,shine all around the world
Come on and let it
Shine,shine,shine all around the world

Hey and its daybreak
Can you feel it
And its daybreak
Can't you sing it
That its daybreak
Sunshine
