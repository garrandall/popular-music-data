Chopper straight shots and then pop bottles, (yea)
Flirt with the hood rats thin pop models (uh huh)
Chopper straight shots and then pop bottles (yea)
Flirt with the hood rats thin pop models,
 OK, we poppin champaign like we won a championship game,
 Look like I got on a championship ring,
 'cause I ball hard,
 No bitch we ball harder,
 I am the Birdman,
 And I'm the J-R-uh,


OK, start with straight shots and then pop bottles,
Pour it on the models,
Shut up bitch, swallow,
If you can't swallow,
Shut up bitch, gargle,
Straight up out that water with my Mark Jacob goggles,
I'm fresher than a motherfucker
Yeah I'm a motherfucker,
No I won't take your girl, but I shall take her tongue from her,
Can't you tell I'm in love woman?
Like no other woman,
Oh, I'm sorry sweetheart,
I thought you were my other woman




Now as I recline behind my desk,
I ain't got a lot of Nikes, but I got a lot of checks, (money)
Got my own shoe brand new on the set,
Went from sitting in the cell,
To sitting on a jet,
From shitting in the cell,
To shitting on a jet,
I lost too many friends, but I won too many bets,
I made too much money, I ain't make enough yet,
So I scratch, and yes,
Junior is the best (shawty)
So many niggas from my hood on they back,
So many niggas from your hood on they back,
That's why we so paid and it be like that,
I'd rather pop a bottle,
Before I pop a gat




Yea, only sipping red champaign,
White-T, red hat, red bandanna,
Uptown, choppers fuck companions,
Fuck with the Birdman we chopping your companion,
Fucking with my son, and we run up on your mansion,
Chopper make music, bitch start dancing,
Stunner-man's back so you know the circumstances,
And I'm cooking up Tha Carter 3, no advances,
All my cars, all the latest automatics,
No lie, we don't even drive no asking,
Uptown, we packing and we stacking,
Young Money, Cash Money we the champions
