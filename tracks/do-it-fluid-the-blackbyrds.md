I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party

When you wanna party
And party, party hearty
Hold up, hold up

When you're getting down
No sense in messing around
Hold up, hold up


Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid

When you wants to move
And trying to stroke a groove
Hold up, hold up

And when you feel a ringle
And your body wants to intermingle
Hold up, hold up



If you wants to get crazy
Slow down and lazy
Hold up, hold up

If you want success
Then do the thing that's best
Hold up, hold up



If you're making shy
And like to be hip and fly
Hold up, hold up

Drugs are for fools
Love will keep you cool
Hold up, hold up



If you're making shy
And like to be hip and fly
Hold up, hold up

Drugs are for fools
Love will keep you cool
Hold up, hold up
