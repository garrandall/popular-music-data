Politician come to power take it slow
People need what you know
You're a leader so you have to play along
Show the hand right or wrong
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn
Either way still get burned
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)

What makes you want to do the best you can?
What makes you a better man?
What makes you try again before too long?
What keeps you standing strong?
What makes you say the things you want to say
To make it a better day?
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it s the pride)
