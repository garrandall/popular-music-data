What's crackin'?
You already know who it is
Ya' boy, Big Tuck
Freight Train Tuck
Astroworld is now in session, ya understand?
I'm the dean of this herr
I got this


Yeah, yeah
Parked at the Days Inn, ain't takin' no days in (yeah)
Don't need no vacation, I need a replacement (alright)
Bustin' the lights out as soon as we came in (it's lit)
What're they talkin' about, what's it pertainin' (yeah, yeah)
Need me a therapist to ask if I'm aging
This M-E-D it feel caved in
All of my demons invadin'
I live paranoid, hesitatin'
They bitin', they bitin', they K'd in
Got out their way, it's okay
'Cause like they dosing the basement
I got to get with my face in


Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fakes I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible


Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold (yeah)
Mixing the water with cheeses, making the money get mould (yeah)
Trying to be like gang, you better go get it in vogue (yeah)
Put 84's on lanes, I robbed, how you think of the spokes
We did it, we said it, we spoke
We put it out, thought it was small, these five or four
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo


Open his eyes, don't need to move in slow
Even though the speed got old
This perc and methamphetamines
On the D's, like the snow
But they soap
Vamanos, speed, see step swings on the rope
Come to reach, and it's broke
Got springs like a tote
Show for free, in the tuck
Shock you, drown like, brown, white diamonds
Class (yah)
Copy sound, might got two wings, Patek (alright!)
Landing down, went and caught two wings (it's lit!)
Tryna scrape, but the stage, two wings
Better pray, better pray in two wings (straight up!)


Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fakes I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible
