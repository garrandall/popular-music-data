Well, I've tried everything to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna quit cryin'
I'm gonna leave you alone
If you believe I'm leavin'
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave

You're gonna need your lovin' daddy some day
Aw, when you're gonna be sorry
'Cause you treated me this way
Aw please, don't that sun look good on you
Yeah please, don't that sun look good goin' down
Don't that old moon look lonesome when you're
Baby's not around, all right

Well, I've tried everything to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna quit cryin'
I'm gonna leave you alone
If you believe I'm leavin'
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave

You're gonna need your lovin' daddy some day
Aw, when you're gonna be sorry
'Cause you treated me this way

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, all right
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, all right, oh
