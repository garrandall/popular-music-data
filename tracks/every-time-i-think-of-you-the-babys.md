Every time I think of you
It always turns out good
Every time I've held you
I thought you understood

People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)

And every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (every single time)
It always turns out good

Seasons come and seasons go
But our love will never die
Let me hold you, darlin'
So you won't cry

'Cause people say that our love affair
Will never last
But we know a love like ours
Will never pass

But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)

And every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (every single time)
It always turns out good

People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)

And every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
It always turns out good

Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you

Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you

Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
