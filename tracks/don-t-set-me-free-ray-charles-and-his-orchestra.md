Don't set me free
And leave me all alone
Don't make me be
Just a rolling stone
Lock me up and throw the key away
Make me a prisoner night and day
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free
On my knees I pray
Have mercy on me
Don't send me away
Like a train jumping off a track
Without you baby, I'd blow my stack
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free


Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you
I could love you better, than anyone else can do


So don't set me free
Though I've done you wrong
Baby can't you see
Without you I can't get along
Keep me in a state of agony
Make me miserable as can be
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free
