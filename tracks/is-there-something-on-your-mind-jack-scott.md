Is there something on your mind
That you're not telling me?
I've loved you oh, so long
I know when something's wrong
Is there something on your mind
Oh tell me, darling
There's something wrong I know
You're troubled some
Tell me what's on your mind
The places we go
The friends we know
They're asking me too
What's come over you?
Is there something on your mind?
Oh tell me, darling
I'll try to smile
Let's talk awhile
Tell me what's on your mind
So tell me, darling
Have I been untrue?
Tell me, darling
Tell me now
Just what's on your mind
Oh tell me, darling
Now that you're here
Now that you're near
Tell me what's on your mind
