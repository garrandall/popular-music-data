Look out, look out
There's a big bad bird that's flyin' about
Come on baby, do the bird with me
Fly, yi, yi, yeah I, yi, yeah, baby
Fly your hands around wing down

Do the bird, do the bird
Do the shimmy, shimmy
I feel for you gimme
Do the bird, do the bird
Come on were gonna work it out now
Hey, hey, there do the bird with might, yeah

Come on take me to the sky above
Fly ,yi, yi, yeah I
Come on baby, we can fall in love
Fly, yi, yi, yeah I
Come on baby, shake it more and go
And youll get another turn to float

Do the bird, do the bird
Youre a crazy flyer
Do the bird, do the bird
You're gonna fly higher, yeah

Do the bird, do the bird
Come on were gonna
Loop-de-loop
We're gonna hula hoop
Twist and fly to the sky, baby, yeah
Do the bird with might, yeah, yeah, yeah

Do the shimmy, shimmy
A feel for you gimme
Come on were gonna
Twist tonight, pony ride
Shake and shout work it out now

Hey baby, do the bird with me
Oh, the bird you're a crazy flyer
You're gonna fly higher
Come on and come back
A rock and roll, baby
