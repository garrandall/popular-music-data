Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take a drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find it's a winding road
I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky


And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Somethin' else knocks me down


Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is


One fine day you wake up
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything
The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well, I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense


Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need


Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is


Yeah
They say your soul is growin' but
Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'


And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
And that's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
Oh, and that's the way it is


Oh, that's the way it is (that's the way it is)
Yeah (that's the way it goes)
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
Oh, you gotta bend when the wind blows
Oh, that's the way it goes
That's the way it is
That's the way it goes
Oh, yeah
You gotta roll with the punches
