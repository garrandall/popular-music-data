Well, I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head
Over you
Over you
I want you to want me, I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

And I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head
Over you
Over you

I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right

I must think of a way
Into your heart
There's no reason why
My being shy
Should keep us apart
And I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Day or night
Everyday, every, every day
