Over you, over you
I want you to want me
I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'Cause I can't explain the tears that I shed
Over you, over you
I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night, wrong or right

I must think of a way into your heart
There's no reason why my being shy should keep us apart
And I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Night and day and oh

Out of my head over you
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Goin' out of my head, hey baby
Out of my head, goin' out of my head
Yeah yeah yeah, ooh ooh, baby
Over you, out of my head

Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head
Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head
Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head
Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head
Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head
Well, I, I think, I think, I think
I'm goin' out of my head

Out of my head
Out of my head

I see you each morning
You just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head
Day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Goin' out of my head
Goin' out of my head
Day and night
Goin' out of my head, ooh baby
