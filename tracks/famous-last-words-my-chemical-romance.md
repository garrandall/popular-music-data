Now, I know that I can't make you stay, but where's your heart?
But where's your heart? But where's your-
And I know there's nothing I can say to change that part
To change that part, to change...


So many bright lights, they cast a shadow, but can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding, I get so weak
A love that's so demanding, I can't speak


I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home


Can you see, my eyes are shining bright, cause I'm out here
On the other side of a jet black hotel mirror, and I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding, I get weak


I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me, I say!


I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid, asleep or dead
How can I see-I see you lying, 'cause I see you lying next to me
How can I see-I see you lying, with words I thought I'd never speak
How can I see-I see you lying, awake and unafraid
How can I see-I see you lying, asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid, asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid, asleep or dead


I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home


I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home...
