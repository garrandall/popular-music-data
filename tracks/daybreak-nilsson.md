Here comes the daylight
It's makin' me sad
Here comes the sunlight
Makin' me sad
Had a good time last night
Best I ever had
Here come the sunshine
That's makin' me sad
So sad, so sad, so sad, so sad

Here come the daybreak
It's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache
I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night
Just me and my friends
But here come the daylight
And now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Here come the daylight
It's bringin' me down
Causin' me heartache
It's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daylight
It's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache
I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night
Just me and my friends
But here come the daylight
And now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Here come the daylight
It's bringin' me down
It's causin' me heartache
It's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daybreak
It's makin' me cough
It's causin' me sunburn
It's pissin' me off
Had a good time last night, yeah
In the moon's glimpse
Now all that'll save me
Is a total eclipse
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...
