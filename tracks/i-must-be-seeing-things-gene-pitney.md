Isn't that my girl
And is that my best friend
Aren't they walking much to close together
And it don't look like their talkin about the weather

I must be seeing things
Oh no it can't be true
I must be hearing things
When I can hear her say to him
I want you, I need you, I love you

Looking through a tear
I can see him kissing her
I can feel my poor heart slowly breaking
I'll do anything if only I was mistakin'

I must be seeing things
Oh no it can't be true
I must be hearing things
When I can hear him say to her
Forget him, It's over, Your mine now

I must be seeing things
I thought I'll never see
I must be hearing things
You made a fool of me
I must be seeing things
And hearing things

Oh no, I need you so, Oh please don't go.....
