Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?

The wind blows, are we not friends?
There is no reason to let it end
Until you set me down
You say you don't love me anymore

I always thought that we could work it out
To keep on loving, I had no doubt
But it's all over town that you went around
I think it's happening girl

Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?

Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you say, yeah?
Who do you give your love to?
And why can't it be me?

I really think I should let it go
I am always the last to know
And I don't really care
Except it's been so long

I'd like to think it was you and me
We fit together so easily
But now I can't get through to the lover in you
You got me guessing again
I'm wondering...

Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?

Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you say, yeah?
Who do you give your love to?
And why can't it be me?

Why can't it be me?
Why can't it be me?

Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?

Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you say, yeah?
Who do you give your love to?
And why can't it be me?

Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?
