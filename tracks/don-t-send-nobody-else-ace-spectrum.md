Don't send me no postcards
Don't send me no letter
No, no, baby

Ain't nothing you
Can do now, girl, no
That'll make things any better
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, girl, oh, yeah
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send nobody else
No, baby, come yourself, yeah

While you're out there
Having your fun, baby
Don't forget about number one, yeah

You see we're so
Connected, girl, yeah
I'm just about to feel neglected
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send nobody else
No, no, baby, come yourself

Cause I need you, girl
In the worst way
Don't think I can take it
Girl, another day

So now, baby
You made me do it
Now come and see to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Listen
Don't wanna be selfish, no, no
Or hold on too tight but, honey
It's a struggle yeah, yeah
And I think I'm losing the fight
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send nobody else
No, no, baby, come yourself

Oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send nobody else
No, no, baby, come yourself

Oh, baby, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send me nobody else
No, no, baby, come home yourself
