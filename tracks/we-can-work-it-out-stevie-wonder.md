(Hey) Try to see things my way (Hey)
Do I have to keep on talking 'till I can't go on?
(Hey) While you see it your way (Hey)
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone


We can work it out
We can work it out


(Hey) Think of what you're saying (Hey)
You can get it wrong and still think that it's alright
(Hey) Think of what I'm saying (Hey)
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night


We can work it out
We can work it out


Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again


(Hey) Try to see things my way (Hey)
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
(Hey) While you see it your way (Hey)
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long


We can work it out
We can work it out, hey


(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
We can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
We can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
We can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
We can work it out
Got a feelin', yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Work it out with me baby
Work it out with me baby, hey


Try to see things my way (Hey)
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
(Hey) While you see it your way (Hey)
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long


We can work it out
We can work it out


Think of what you're saying (Hey)
You can get it wrong and still think that it's alright (Hey, hey)
Think of what I'm saying (Hey)
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night


We can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
We, we, we, we can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(We can work it out)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh, we can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Can you work it out baby
We can, we can work it out
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh yeah, we can work
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
We can work, we can work it out
