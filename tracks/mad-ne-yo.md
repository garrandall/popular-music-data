Whoa whoa, no whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa oh


Mmh, she's staring at me, I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Mmh, nobody's talking, 'cause talking just turns into screaming, oh
And now as I'm yelling over her, she yelling over me
All that that means is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse, that we don't even remember why we're fighting


So both of us are mad for nothing (fighting for)
Nothing (crying for)
Nothing (whoa oh oh)
When we won't let it go for nothing (come back for)
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got


Oh baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain
But baby can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (can't sleep through the pain)
Girl I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me
No, I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me
Oh no, no, no


Mmh, and it gets me upset, girl, when you're constantly accusing, oh, hey
(Asking questions like you already know)
We fight in this war, baby when both of us are losing, oh, whoa
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)
(What happened to working it out?)
We fall into this place where you ain't backing down
And I ain't backing down
So what the hell do we do now?


It's all for nothing (fighting for)
Nothing (crying for)
Nothing (whoa oh oh)
We won't let it go for nothing (no, not for)
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got


Oh baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain (hey, it's gonna rain, mmh)
But baby can we make up now (oh oh oh)
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (uh, can't sleep through the pain)
Girl I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me
No, I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me
Oh no, no, no


Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect, oh no (perfect, perfect, oh)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight
As long as everything's alright between us
Before we go to sleep
Baby we're gonna be, happy
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa, oh whoa!


Baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain (soon it's gonna rain)
But baby can we make up now (can we make up now)
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (can't sleep through the pain)
Girl I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you (oh)
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me (oh)
No, I don't wanna go to bed, mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed, mad at me
Oh no, no, no
