Woke up this morning and you were gone
Found your note by the telephone
You said goodbye
I won't be back this way

I guess in time Ill figure it out
The flame burned and flickered out
You sped away and you turned down the highway

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away

Seemed like I never got a hold on you
The harder I tried the more desperate I grew
I should have known I couldn't change your heart
You once said you need to be free
Oh babe you could have been with me
You fade away like the sun turning to darkness

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away

In this life we might find our way
But love is more than just day to day

Why (Echo) why why why

So you ran
So you ran
So you ran

Baby
I wonder who your with tonight
Can he save you from the sacrafice
Will he love you hold you
For another day
Or is it just a stop on your lonly highway

Baby

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
So you ran
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away
