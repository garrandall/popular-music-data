Falling asleep at the wheel again baby 
You're drifting over the line (the line) yeah 
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly 
Fix me, can you read the signs? 

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty 
And dreaming of the other side 
Save your tears and laughter 
Because it doesn't matter what you find 

It ain't pretty 
After the show 
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you 
With no place to go 
If you think you need it 
Here's the place to feed it 
But it ain't pretty 

With everything that you do is wrong 
And you fell like you can barely survive yeah 
When those around you are crumbling downwards 
Buried in the sunset alive 

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty 
And screaming like you're back from hell 
Save your dreams and occupations 
Cos' it doesn't matter what you sell 

It ain't pretty 
After the show 
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you 
With no place to go 
If you think you want it 
Here's the place to get it 
But it ain't pretty 

The party's over and the road is long 
The party's over and we're moving on 
The party's over and the road is long 

So if you think you want it 
Then just come out and say it 
It aint pretty 

Falling asleep at the wheel again baby 
You're drifting over the line (the line) 
You're hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly 
Fix me, can you read the signs 

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty 
And dreaming like you're outta control 
Save your tears and laughter 
Because this is the ride 
And this is the show 

It ain't pretty 
After the show 
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you 
With no place to go 
So if you think you want it 
Just come in and get it 
It ain't pretty
