YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A STAR
Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr
You can come as you are with just your heart
And I'll take you in though you're rejected and hurt
To me you're worth, girl, what you have within
Oh honey, boy, I don't need no superstar cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied cause I'm satisfied with the love that you can inspire
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show;
Oh, honey, you don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
Somebody nobody knows could steal the tune that you want to hear
So stop your running around cause now you've found what was cloudy is clear
Oh honey, there'll be no cheering from the clouds, just two hearts beating
Out loud
There'll be no parade, no tv or stage, only me till your dying day
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show;
Oh, honey, you don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
Don't think your star has to shine for me to find out where you're coming
From;
Oh honey, girl, what is a beauty queen if it don't mean that I'm number one?
I don't need no superstar cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied cause I'm satisfied with the love that you can inspire
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show;
Oh, honey, you don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
