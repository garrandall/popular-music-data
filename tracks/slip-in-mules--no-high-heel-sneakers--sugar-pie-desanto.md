Baby, my red dress in the cleaner
But my shoes will steal the show
Lord, yes, my red dress in the cleaner
But my shoes will steal the show

Yes, it's fitting, child
It's fitting, Lord
And it ain't the back
That's cut too low

Ain't wearing no high-heel sneaker
Cause they hurt my toes so bad
Ain't wearing no high-heel sneakers, child
Cause they hurt my toes so bad

So wear your spats and calfskin shoes
To match my low heel slip-in mules

Ain't wearing no high-heel sneakers
Cause they hurt my toes so bad
Ain't wearing no high-heel sneaker, Lord
Cause they hurt my toes so bad

Just wear your spats and calfskin shoes
To match my low heel slip-in mules
