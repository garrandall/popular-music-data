I never knew there was a love like this before
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before


Now that we have come to be
A brand new life I can't see
Never thought you'd be a special part of me
No, baby
The reasons are because of you
I can go on and make it through
I can't even take my mind off lovin' you
And I wanna say


I never knew there was a love like this before
(A love like this before, no)
Never had someone to show me a love (Oh)
Love like this before


I know you can't see
All the things you mean to me
I'm so amazed that you are mine
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
If we can work together
Maybe this could last forever
This is something that I wanna hold on to
So baby, try to understand


Baby, try to understand
I'll be crazy if you leave (Crazy)
'Cause you compliment my style (Oh)
And I like the way you walk, and the sexy things you talk
(The way you walk, the way you talk)
You don't know just what you do to me
You see I never (Oh, never)


I never (Never) knew there was a love like this before
(A love like this before, no)
Never had someone to show me a love
(Oh, I never had a) Love like this before
I never knew there was a love like this before
(Never knew, never knew)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before (Baby, try to understand)


Baby, try to understand
I'll go crazy if you leave
'Cause you compliment my style (You compliment my style)
And I like the way you walk, and the sexy things you talk (Oh yeah)
You don't know just what you do to me
You see I never (Oh, never, never)


Never knew a
Never knew a
Never knew a
Love like this before
(Never knew no other love, no)
Never knew a
Never knew a
Never knew a
(Never had someone, no)
Love like this before (Oh)


I never knew there was a love like this before (I never)
(Never had somebody)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
I never knew there was a love like this before
(I never knew a love like you)
Never had someone to show me a love (Yeah yeah)
Love like this before
I never knew there was a love like this before
(A love like this before)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
