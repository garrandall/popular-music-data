JUST SO LONELY
Get Wet
Lonely, just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
Just so lonely
Just for you
It wasn't what I wanted
And I do know right from wrong
I wasn't out to prove or doubt
That we've got something strong
It was one less hour of sitting alone
Like last year's favorite doll
Runnin' my fingers across the phone
Hopin' that you might call
The girl was just so lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
I wasn't out to hurt you
Wasn't sure you'd even care
When I turned the key I knew it had to be
Cause I really needed someone there
I needed the heat from a young man's lips
To break the darkness of my room
But his kisses weren't sweet enough
To make that hour bloom
For the girl who's lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
Just so lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
But when I closed my eyes I knew
Nobody else's arms would ever do
So I sent him home and got oh so lonely
(Lonely just for you)
So lonely
(Lonely just for you)
So lonely
(Lonely just for you)
Lonely just for you
