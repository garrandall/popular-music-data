Oh, you had me crying
Tears upon your pillow
Hanging your head on the wall

Show 'em you can take it
Serve it like
You never could fall

Stillsane
You may think you're crossing the line
Stillsane
You may think you're losing your mind

As you stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Oh, oh, oh, stillsane

Oh, you had me running
Crazy without looking
Hurling around in the night

Turn another corner
Everything is brighter
Smile with your face to the light

Stillsane
You may think you're crossing the line
Stillsane
You may think you're losing your mind

As you stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Oh, oh, oh, stillsane

Oh, just keep 'em guessing
No one has to know it
All of your love is in vain

Better keep your chin up
Even if they strike it
Give them no pleasure from your pain

Stillsane
They may think you're crossing the line
Stillsane
They may think you're losing your mind

Stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Stare at their faces

Oh, oh, stillsane
Stillsane, oh, na, na, na
Stillsane, stillsane
Oh, na, na, na, stillsane

Stillsane, stillsane
Oh, na, na, na, stillsane
Stillsane, stillsane
