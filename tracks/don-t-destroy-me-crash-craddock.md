You mean so much to me
I love you can't you see
You're true as true can be
So don't, don't destroy me

I give my heart to you
A foolish thing to do
So darling please be true
So don't, don't destroy me

If you should leave me now
I'd say I'd forget and forgive
But I'd remember your vow
With a heartache as long as I live

So hold my heart with care
My life and love are there
Please give me yours to share
So don't, don't destroy me
