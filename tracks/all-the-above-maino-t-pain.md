Tell me what do you see
When you're looking at me
(Woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Woooahhhh)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above 


Listen
Really what do you see
When you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing
See me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom
I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich
Heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block
Look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love now
When I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame
Money ain't goin' to shame?
The new Benz is all white
Call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes?
You take all of this from me
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters
Mad that I finally made it
Take a look and you can tell
That I'm destined for greatness


Tell me what do you see
When you're looking at me
(Woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Woooahhhh)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above 


It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


Tell me what do you see
When you're looking at me
(Woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Woooahhhh)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above 


Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

All the above
