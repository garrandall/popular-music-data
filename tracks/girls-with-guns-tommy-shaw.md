I'll tell you now
And I won't tell you twice
Where when and how
I got some bad advice

I never thought I could handle
A girl with guns
Let me tell you, you can bet
That I'm not the only one

Stand tall
Don't think small
Don't get your back
Against the wall
Shoot straight
I can't wait
Aim for the heart
And fire away

I've come around
I understand today
She's a target now
I'm gonna have my way

Everybody says don't go messing
With a girl with guns
They don't need you
They couldn't love you
They couldn't be any fun

Stand tall
Don't think small
Don't put your back
Against the wall
Shoot straight
Don't wait to fire away

An innocent bystander
Who forgets to look both ways
Who never tries to understand her
Won't feel the heat till it's too late
So I tell you

Stand tall
Don't think small
Don't put your back
Against the wall
Shoot straight
Don't wait to fire away

Stand tall
Don't think small
Don't put your back
Against the wall
Shoot straight
I can't wait
Aim for the heart
And fire away

Stand tall
Don't think small
Don't put your back
Against the wall
Shoot straight
Don't wait to fire away
