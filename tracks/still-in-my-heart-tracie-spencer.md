Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter
'Cause you're still in my heart


Thinking of you
Brings tears to my eyes
Seems yesterday
We were planning our lives

I'm so confused
Wondering why
How could you leave
Without saying goodbye

Picture your smile
Inside of my head
Still smell your cologne
All over my bed

Miss you so much
I pray every night
That the angels are watching
And treating you right

I sing to myself
So nobody hears
There's just no escaping
The sounds of my tears

Miss you so much
And every night
I can't get to sleep
It ain't right

Memories keep holding me down
There's just no fun
When you're not around

Don't know what to do
Now I'm faced with the truth
Somehow I thought that we would always be



Still in my heart
Still in my heart
You're still in my heart
It doesn't matter
'Cause you're still in my heart

You're still in my heart
You're still in my heart
You're still in my heart
It doesn't matter
'Cause you're still in my heart

You're still in my heart
You're still in my heart
You're still in my heart
