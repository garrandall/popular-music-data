Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you doing huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a m√©nage
'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids!
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit
We in Kanye West's Benz, 'cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian
Yeah


They ask me what I do and who I do it for (yeah)
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio (yeah)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho (true)

It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get you girl


They ask me what I do and who I do it for (yeah)
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio (yeah)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho (true)
