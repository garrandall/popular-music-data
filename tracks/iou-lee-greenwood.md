You believe, that l've changed your life forever
And you're never gonna find another somebody like me
And you wish, you had more than just a lifetime to give back all
I've given you and that's what you believe
But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for
You know that when I'm holding you you're right where you belong
And my love, I can't help but smile with wonder
When you tell me all I've done for you 'Cause I've known all
Along. But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
'Cause I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away. And
I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
