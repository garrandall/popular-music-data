18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
"Baby, don't forget"


Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way


Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me


This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
"Hey mama, don't forget


To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me"


Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But "Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah, I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me"
