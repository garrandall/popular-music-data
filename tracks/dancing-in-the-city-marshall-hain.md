If you're a stranger here
And you need some action
We have a remedy
That could really catch on

Pleased to see another face
At light-up time
If you're feeling dull and run-down
We can really make you shine

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Can you feel the darkness call
Let the street have their way
They'll carry you on 'til morning
And steal your soul away

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Dancin' in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight
