Who draws the crowd
And plays so loud
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show
You know, baby
It's the guitar man

He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will bring you down
Then he'll get you high

Something keeps him going
Miles and miles a day
To find another place to play

Night after night
Who treats you right
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's on the radio
You go listen to the guitar man

Then he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place

Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
Searching for the songs to play

Then you listen to the music
And you like to sing-along
You want to get the meaning
Out of each and every song

Then you find yourself a message
And some words
To call your own
And take them home

He can make you love
He can get you high
He will bring you down
Then he'll make
Make you cry

Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go

Then the lights begin to flicker
And the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter
And the crowds are getting thin

But he never seems to notice
He's just got to find
Another place to play

Any way
Got to play
Either way
Got to play
