Buried treasure
All that hidden loot
She didn't seem so dangerous
Harmless, yeah to boot
You break the ice
She'll turn on you
She's way beyond the law
She yells, "Freeze!"
When you want her to thaw

She's a dead aim, sure shot
Sweet ammo in her shoe
What fits right at her chest
She's got aiming right at you
She'll make a sharp inspection
Of more than head to toe
Then she'll slap her handcuffs on
And say, "Honey, you can't go"

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Concealed weapons
The most dangerous you ever saw
Stick 'em up, concealed weapons
Concealed weapons
They oughta be against the law

You might have her covered
But there ain't no way to stop her
She's got her secret weapons
And there's no way she will drop 'em
She can change hands -- turn around
And take a fancy shot
If you can put the bullet
Into her cartridget slot

Spead 'em out, palms down
Up against the wall
You been had but you ain't sad
No army you can call
And when she pats you down
You best not take a risk
Speak not, move not
When she starts to frisk

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up
Concealed weapons
She's gonna beat you to the draw
Stick 'em up, concealed weapons
Concealed weapons
They oughta be against the law

She didn't know what she was packin'
She didn't know my heart was crackin'
She was shootin' with live ammunition
She was attackin' from every position
She had me pinned down, flat on the floor
She blew me away and I was hurtin' for sure
Concealed weapons, concealed weapons
They oughta be against the law
Stick 'em up
Concealed weapons
