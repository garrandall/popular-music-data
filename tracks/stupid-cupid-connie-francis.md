Stupid cupid
You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings
So you can't fly
I'm in love
And it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

I can't do my homework
And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning
'Bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

You mixed me up
But good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart

You've got me jumping
Like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

You've got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
