My fine feathered friend with your cute little pranks
I would like to express my thanks
I trusted you implicitly
But what a double-crosser
You turned out to be

Stupid Cupid you're a real mean guy (stupid cupid)
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly (stupid cupid)
I'm in love and it's a crying shame (stupid cupid)
And I know that you're the one to blame (stupid cupid)
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop picking on me

I can't do my homework and I can't think straight (stupid cupid)
I meet her every morning bout half past eight (stupid cupid)
Well, I'm acting like a lovesick fool (stupid cupid)
You've even got me carrying her books to school (stupid cupid)
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

You messed me up for good right from the very start
Hey, now, go play Robin Hood
With somebody else's heart

You got me jumping like a crazy clown (stupid cupid)
And I don't feature what you're putting down (stupid cupid)
Well, since I kissed her loving lips of wine (stupid cupid)
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine (stupid cupid)
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

Yeah!

Oh!

Whoa!

You got me jumping like a crazy clown (stupid cupid)
And I don't feature what you're putting down (stupid cupid)
Hey, since I kissed her loving lips of wine (stupid cupid)
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine (stupid cupid)
Hey, hey, set me free
A-stupid Cupid stop picking on me

Hey, hey, set me free
Well, stupid Cupid stop picking on me

(Stupid cupid)
(Stupid cupid)
(Stupid cupid)
(Stupid cupid)
(Stupid cupid)
(Stupid cupid)
