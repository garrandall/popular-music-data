If only you would have kissed me
The way that she kissed me
And if only (la-la-la) you would have loved me (la-la-la)
The way that (la-la-la) she loved me
But you didn't, now she's with me
Oh, yes, darlin', she's everything I wanted you to be-ee-ee-ee-ee

And it's-a not that I love her so much more
It's just she gave me the love I've been longin' for
Oh-oh the love I wanted from you
Oh, from you, oh

If only (only) you would have wanted me (la-la-la)
The way she (la-la-la) says she wants me (wants me)
And if only (only) you said you needed me (la-la-la)
The way she (la-la-la) said she needs me (needs me)
But you didn't say a word to me
Oh, yes, darlin', she's everything I wanted you to be-ee-ee-ee
She's everything I wanted you to be
Oh, ev-ev-everything I wanted you to be

FADE
Oh, yes, everything I wanted you to be
