People see us everywhere
They all think we really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe.

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes my dreams come true
My one and only you.

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me
But it's only make believe.

My hopes my dreams come true
My life I give for you
My heart or wedding ring
My all my everything.

My heart I can't control
You lure my very soul
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me
But it's only make believe.

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you.

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My plans, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe...
