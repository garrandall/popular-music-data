Oh, come on, oh yeah


Well I tried to tell ya so (yes, I did)
But I guess ya didn't know, as I said the story go
Baby, now I got the flow
Cause I know it from the start, baby when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'd win
You lied to me, all those times I saide I loved you
You lied to me, yes I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me, even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me, yes I cried, yes I cried


Return of the mack (there it is)
Return of the mack (come on)
Return of the mack (Oh my God)
You know that I'll be back (here I am)
Return of the mack (once again)
Return of the mack (how bout the world)
Return of the mack (watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (her I go)


So i'm back up in the game (hustlin' so)
Runnin' things to keep my swing (all night long)
Lettin' all the people know, that I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know is wrong, all the nasty things you done (oh oh oh)
So baby listen carfully, while I sing my complex song
You lied to me, cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me, but you did, but you did
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do do do




Yo, I know this chick named Monique
She lives right across the street, she's a freak, eyein' me like the sheek
(So hit that) Inbetween her sheets, the skins was cheap
Like a tray bag of weed, or a T-shirt right up off the street

She took a bite now they call her Applebum
Never lay in the dumb, sodimize her for the funds
Lifestyle sudductive, low budget high class
Is all for a nut kid, she's the eve of destruction (ya lied to me)

Tried to paly me like I'm nothin'
This rap stuntin', cock them legs, ready to spread
Then you ask cause you a chickenhead

Now for your main concern, this love trial has been ajurned
Mark Morrison and Shadez, round mack and return
So burn baby burn


Ya lied to me 
But I do, but I do do do
