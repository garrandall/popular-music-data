Early evening and the weather's fair
Dark glasses and don't give a care
Finger popping out on the street
All dressed and neat
My buddy pulls up in a Cadillac
Driving slow with the top left back
Patiently, the girls, they wait
For their heavy date

(CHORUS)
And it's gonna be good times
It's gonna be good times
It's gonna be good times
Good times
To a slow stop at the first girl's door
I don't plan to be back til four
The old folks, they don't worry, you see
They have trust in me

(CHORUS)
Today I'm gonna get my bread
For tonight I've got to look my best
My girl would be full of smiles
When the music begins
We're gonna dance awhile
Fast music and the room smoked up
Double clutch in an old beer cup
Digging music from the old hi-fi
Giving her the eye

(CHORUS)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
