In a cavern down by a canyon
Excavatin' for a mine
There lived a miner from North Carolina
And his daughter, chubby Clementine

Now every mornin', just about dawnin'
A'when the sun begins to shine
You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine

A'took the foot bridge, way 'cross the water
Though she weighed two-ninety nine
The old bridge trembled and disassembled
(Oops!) dumped her into the foamy brine

Hey, crackle like thunder, (ho, ho) she went under
(ho, ho) blowin bubbles (bubble sound) down the line
Hey, I'm no swimm'a but were she slimm'a
I might'a saved that Clementine

(Ho) broke the record, way under water
I thought that she was doin' fine
I wasn't nervous ya until the service
That they held for Clementine

Hey you sailor (ho, ho) way out in your whaler
With a harpoon, your trusty line
If she shows now, yo, there she blows now
It just may be chunky Clementine

(One more time)
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' , oh my darlin' sweet Clementine
You may be gone

But!
You're not forgotten
Fare thee well
So long, Clementine
(Bubble sound) Bye!
