Way up north (north to Alaska)
Way up north (north to Alaska)
North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on
North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two
With George Pratt his partner, and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome

Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow
With the northern lights a-runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of nineteen-one

Where the river is windin', big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on
Way up north (north to Alaska)
Way up north (north to Alaska)
North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on
North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said "Sam you're a-lookin' at a lonely, lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand

'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember, Sam, a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome"

Where the river is winding, big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska, a-go north, the rush is on
North to Alaska, a-go north, the rush is on
Way up north (north to Alaska)
Way up north (north to Alaska)
Way up north (north to Alaska)
Way up north (north to Alaska)
