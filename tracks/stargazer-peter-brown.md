She said she don't love me anymore
She knows my life will never be
The way it was before
She wishes I weren't so far away
But then again
There isn't much she has to say

If I only had some time
It would be all right
But I have to be this
Stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying

She said that she'd find somebody new
To understand this crazy man
Is more than she can do

She's sorry it had to be this way
But then again, it's just another
Price to pay

If I only had some time
It would be all right
But I have to be this
Stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying

Oh, you gotta believe in something
You gotta love her true
Oh, you gotta believe in someone
And crazy as it seems
Oh, you always believed in me

If I only had some time, it would be all right
But I have to be this stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying

She said she don't love me anymore
