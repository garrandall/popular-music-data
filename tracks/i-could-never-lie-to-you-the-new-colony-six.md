Have you heard me say
Baby I love you
Every word is true
I could never lie to you my love
I could never lie to you

And did you mean
Every kiss you gave me
Because I meant mine
You mean more to me
Than all the world
I'll love you till the end of time

Baby let me see you smile
The one you used to save for me
We're lovin' one another
That's how our lives should be

Have you heard me say
Living's not easy
Thinking every moment of you
You made me forget
All my other loves
I could never lie to you

Have you heard me say
Baby I love you
Every word is true
I could never lie to you my love
I could never lie to you
I could never lie to you
