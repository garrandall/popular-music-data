Girl Of My Best Friend
Girl Of My Best Friend
Ral Donner
(Written by Beverly Ross and Sam Bobrick)
Peaked at # 19 in 1961
Ral's voice sounded so much like Elvis's, he was used as a narrator of the 1981
Docudrama "This Is Elvis."
(bah dooby doo) The way she walks
(bah dooby doo) The way she talks
(bah dooby doo) How long can I pretend?
Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love with the girl of my best friend
(bah dooby doo) Her lovely hair
(bah dooby doo) Her skin so fair
(bah dooby doo) This could go on and never end
Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love with the girl of my best friend (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I long to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then (ah, ah, ah, ah)
What if she got real mad and told him so?
I could never face either one again (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Ah, hah, umm
The way they kiss (bah dooby oh
Their happiness (bah dooby oh
Will my aching heart ever mend?
Or will I always be in love with the girl of my best friend?
(bah dooby oh Please make it end
(bah dooby oh Oh, let it end
(bah dooby oh Why won't it end?
FADE
