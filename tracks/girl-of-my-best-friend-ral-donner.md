So what's going on?
(Well, you know.  Things have been happening)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You always talk that things have been happening stuff
You know what I'm saying
I want thinks to be happening between me and you
You know mean
(Oh everything's cool and everything, but I don't know)
(I don't know, I just don't know)
Yo, I don't have time for that I don't know stuff
You know what I'm saying, I'm ready to do this now
You know mean
I'm a man who's used to not settling down with one girl you know but
Yo, like for real I'm break myself down you know I want you to be with me
You know what I'm saying


Yo, first things first
I Kardinal seems to always find a way
To strip my soul of a bad man's status
The phone apparatus seems to be my killer
Before the soundwaves slices my heart all of my insides tenses
All of my senses telling me the next flex
âCause my Madmoizellez, tone suggest I am alone
Madmoizelle have a different face, different body same character
Because it lives within the nature, that's why it's natu-ral to the Offishall
That I should live for the time, so that I won't lose my mind
Word up
To give you artificial, hoping futuristic dreams about a never-ending team
What the fail to neglect, is that in retrospect
Why they take a piece of you, what you receiving isn't true (word up)
How many times you hear that I'm gonna, we're gonna
Check it, just get to steppin' cause you're damaging my reppin'
My best friend's suppose to be my ace
When both of we is genuine, then I might let you shine Madmoizelle
My best friend's suppose to by my ace
When both of we is genuine, then I might let you shine Madmoizelle


Baby when I know
I know how to leave Madmoizelle
I will put you on as well
There's no fronting, all of we can do
I know you can be my Madmoizelle
I was with you on as well
There's no stopping all of we can do


I was lead to believe that both of we would be
In the same vicinity, for infinity
Check the lyricy, talks of walking, sexin' in parks after dark
Turn to private relation, for word sensation
Dreams of my seed having you there to raise him right
And while he's sleeping, I can bust a lyric to your heart heating
I bear withâ¦
But those weren't suppose to be an option
After crossing lines of manhood, tears we both feared
But I knew I wasn't gonna, as long as I had you in my corner
But then you as a friend started to disappear
I couldn't hear what you was saying
Just, the Madmoizelle's face displaying
Enough young, but old enough to know the best is incomprehendable
The grasp of life you possess, if you taught me something
It was to be solo on the search, you should be attached to no one
Ambilicals was cut at birth, Madmoizelle




Where you were carasseing me, emotionally undressing me
I couldn't wait for the next session and counting blessings
Now that you were part of life, living through dramas wasn't nothin'
No fronting, your aspiration let me know that you were something
A mind's travel to distance places, on top of mountains
Touching the sky together through different climates and weather
But this was all reduced to a verbal seduce
When I was introduced to past, all that going too fast isht
Once bitten, twice shy, once written Eye & I
Seen many doves cry but I never heard you lie
Still the one thing that scares me is that you're true
Although it's ripping me apart, can't go back and stop supporting you
Breddrens for life, nobody else could share your title
Besides God, money and Mom, it's in you that I see you knight
Looking in your eyes is poof, with powers of bud
It's a wonder that we never made love.
