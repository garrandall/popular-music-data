Who gets the guy at the end of the show?
I'd like to know
People say you have found another
Is it true, what they say?

When the picture's over, will it be all over?
Tell me, who gets the guy
In that last sweet caress?
Don't make me guess

Lovin' you has become my whole life
I can't live without you
When it's time to walk out
Are you gonna walk out?

And that's why I just keep listenin'
To the music to see if it's happy or sad
Because if it's happy that's how I feel
And if it's sad, well, that's too bad for me

Woah, can't you see just how much I need you?
It just has to be me
Tell me that the ending is a happy ending for me
And that I get the guy

Woah, can't you see just how much I need you?
It just has to be me
Please tell me that the ending is a happy ending

Can't you see just how much I need you?
It just has to be me
