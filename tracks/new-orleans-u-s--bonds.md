I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah
(I said a-hey-hey-hey-yeah)
I said, a-hey, a-hey-hey-yeah
(Said, a-hey, a-hey-hey-yeah)

Well, come on ev'rybody
Take a trip with me
Well, down the Mississippi
Down to New Orleans

They got the honeysuckle bloomin'
On the honeysuckle vine
And a-love is a-bloomin' there
All-a the time

You know every Southern Belle
Is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi
Down in New Orleans

I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah
(I said, hey-hey-hey-yeah)
I said, a-hey-a-hey-a-hey-yeah
(Said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah)

Well, come on take a stroll
Down to Basin Street
Yeah, listen to the music
With the dixieland beat

A-where the magnolia blossoms
Fill the air

Yeah, an if you ain't been to heaven
Then you ain't been there

They got the French moss
Hangin' from a big oak tree
Down the Mississippi
Down in New Orleans

I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah
(Said, hey-hey-hey-yeah)
I said a-look out, child!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Said, look out child, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Well, come on ev'rybody
Take a trip with me
Well, down the Mississippi
Down to New Orleans

Well, the honeysuckle's bloomin'
On the honeysuckle vine
Yeah, and the love is a-bloomin' there
All the time

You know that every Southern Belle
Is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi
Down in New Orleans

Hey, hey!

Well, I says, a-hey-hey-a-hey-yeah
(Said, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

I said, a-look out child!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
