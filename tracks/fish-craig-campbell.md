The first time we did it I was scared to death
She snuck out in that cotton dress
Jumped on in and we drove to the lake
Put her hand on my knee and said I canât wait
I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck
Turns out my baby loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
Sheâs hooked and now she canât get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

After that thatâs all she wanted to do
But that was okay âcause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ainât bitinâ she donât give up
Turns out my baby loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
Sheâs hooked and now she canât get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

I love to see her silhouette reflectinâ off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
âCause I found a girl who loves to...

Fish, I love to see her lyinâ
There on the bank âneath the full moon light
Man, I canât even believe my luck
I found a girl who loves to...


Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
Sheâs hooked and now she canât get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
Yeah, I know she loves to fish
Psst, you awake, letâs fish
