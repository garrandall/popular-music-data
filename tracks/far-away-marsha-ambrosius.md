Yeah yeah I know I know I know 
Its getting diffitcal baby we always travial and 
We always doing shit seem like ever thing comes 
Before we do right let me talk to you for a minute in 

Treating how the body,the heart, and the mine works 
Undescribable love like witnessing a childs birth define 
The hugs you gave that leaves a a divine 
Thirst that feeling that makes me think before 
I speak and smile first the heart grows founder 
While in during distance so close but to far to 
Even make a difference baby I trying to fix this 
You know what kind of shit we cant even see 
Each another and be in the same city weboth 
Living those types of lifes thay put on pedestal 
Navigating presonla space with hectic schedule 
And thus I try hard their still somethings I need 
To step up my baby beaf like I ain't trying to make 
Enough effort I ain't been trying to mess up just trying 
To capture the minutes its just the time will pass 
By and I get caught up in it thus reality harsher 
I hope you can forgive the arthur I ain't just 
Trying to let you leave I love you marsha 
You're so far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Didn't want you to go babe, babe

Ooh tear stains on my pillow
Tryna forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
More days and counting
I've been laying and staring
Myself in the mirror
All alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gonna think with my head
Cause my heart is what got me here
So hurt from what you've done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
Cause I gave you my word
You put your trust in me
Supposed to be the one to give you what you need
I was by your side
When we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so

Far away
And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah...

If I'd have known Sunday morning
That you would be gone
I would have never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone
To hear the voice at your tone
I knew that something was wrong babe
The cops the one who had told me
That you was alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby
So far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah...
Can't believe that you're gone 

Its funny how I miss you babe (Please come back now I miss you baby)
Back in my life why don't you babe (Say where u been I been Needin' you babe) 
You ain't have to leave me boooooy (You know you ain't have to leave me)
Without you I can't go on (without you I cant go ooooon)

Its funny how I miss you babe (Please come back now I miss you baby)
Back in my life why don't you babe (Say where u been I been Needin' you babe) 
You ain't have to leave me boooooy (You know you ain't have to leave me)
Without you I can't go on (without you I cant go ooooon)
