So sad to see you go so soon
I know that you ain't comin' back
In the beginnin' everything was cool
Toward the end of it all, it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm movin' on again, I sure that you will understand
I played by the rules, You played by the game
I couldn't have stayed, It's easier to say
Cause I was by your side when you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away


And every minute you're gone, I missin' you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different, if you could here me baby
Now that you're so far away -ay -ay -ay


Tear stains on my pillow
Tryin' to forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Four day and countin', I've been layin' here
Starin' myself in the mirror all alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gotta think with my head
Cause my heart is what go me here
So hurt from what you done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
Cause I gave you my word, you put you're trust in me
Supposed to be the one
To give you what you need
I was by your side when we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so




If I had known Sunday morning, that you would be gone
I would've never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone to hear the voice had a tone
I knew that something was wrong
The cop's the one who had told me that you were alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby, so far away





Please come back I miss you baby
?
Will you ever need me
Without you I can't go on
X2
