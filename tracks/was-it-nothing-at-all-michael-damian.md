Driving in the car
With the wind run through your hair
I reach for you now
But you're not there

It was perfect time
A perfect place for us to be
The nights were so warm
You were close to me
Was it nothing at all?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

The music can play
As the sun started to fade
Our dream vacation
Was in my mind

Just the other day
I thought I heard you call my name
I wake up, she's gone
There's no one to blame
Was it nothing at all?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

I tell you right away
I want you back into my life
But if you don't find the way
I would dream of you tonight

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

Just the other day
I thought I heard you call my name...

Was it nothing at all...

I wake up she's gone...
