(Kenny Young)

Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh, no come and sit here by the fire
For a spell, sugar
Oh, ho, please take your shoes off and make yourself comfortable
The weather's miserable and you're so kissable
It's getting late
Why don't you stay
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no please don't go
Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh, no, come and sit here by the fire for a speel, sugar
Oh, ho, the house is ours now that everybody's gone
And while the telly's on we should be having fun
It's gettin glate
Why don't you wait
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no please don't go
Don't go out into the rain you're gonna melt sugar
Oh, no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell sugar
Oh ho, it's getting late
Why don't you wait
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no, don't be insane
