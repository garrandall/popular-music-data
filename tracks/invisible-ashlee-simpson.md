Like a grain on the beach
Like a star in the sky
Far too many to count with the naked eye
They wonât see you

Go ahead
Walk on by
You donât know Iâm alive
Maybe one day youâll find
You should open your eyes
You donât know me


Youâre the one who looked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And youâre the one who walked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible

Little things adding up
Try so hard not to rush
Giving in, letting go of the world we know
They wonât see you

Force it down
Lose the taste
They all think itâs a waste
We donât need to believe every word they say, now
They donât know me


Youâre the one who looked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And youâre the one who walked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible

Itâs so easy to be lost
But maybe youâre not lost at all

Do you recognize me?
Do you know who I am?
Do you see me now?
Do you see me now?


Youâre the one who looked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And youâre the one who walked right through me
Now youâre saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
I'm invisible
Iâm invisible
