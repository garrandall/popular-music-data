Like a grain on the beach
Like a star in the sky
Far too many to count with the naked eye
They won’t see you
Go ahead
Walk on by
You don’t know I’m alive
Maybe one day you’ll find
You should open your eyes
You don’t know me


You’re the one who looked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you’re the one who walked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was invisible


Little things adding up
Try so hard not to rush
Giving in, letting go of the world we know
They won’t see you
Force it down
Lose the taste
They all think it’s a waste
We don’t need to believe every word they say, now
They don’t know me


You’re the one who looked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you’re the one who walked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was invisible


It’s so easy to be lost
But maybe you’re not lost at all
Whoa, whoa
Do you recognize me?
Whoa, whoa
Do you know who I am?
Whoa, whoa
Do you see me now?
Whoa, whoa
Do you see me now?


You’re the one who looked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you’re the one who walked right through me
Now you’re saying that you knew me
When I was, whoa
Invisible


I'm invisible
I'm invisible
