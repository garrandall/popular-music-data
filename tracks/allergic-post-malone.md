Wasted on Sunday
Erase you on Monday
Allergic, allergic
Gave in by Friday
Went straight back to sideways
Allergic, allergic

I took your pills and your drugs
Just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

So sad but true
Friends with all my demons
The only one who sees them
Too bad for you
So sad but true
Give a hundred million reasons
But why could you believe them?
Too bad for you

Yeah we fight and we fuck
Until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up
But never sober enough
Allergic, allergic
Instead of holdin' me down
You're only holdin' me up
It shouldn't be so hard
This is impossible love
Allergic, allergic

I took your pills and your drugs
Just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

So sad but true
Friends with all my demons
The only one who sees them
Too bad for you
So sad but true
Give a hundred million reasons
But why could you believe them?
Too bad for you

So sad but true
Give a hundred million reasons
But why could you believe them?
Too bad for you
