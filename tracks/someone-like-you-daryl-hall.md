Only you could ever know
How hard it was for me to let you go
Hard to face all those nights
And suffer thru all the fools advice
Seems tome it's not so bad
to try for the kind of love that we had
Oh I need that romance
One that grows strong
When it's got no chance 

Now you're gone away
And I'm left to carry on
Ain't nobody else gonna bear up to comparison
And if I can't have the real thing
Then I've got to find someone
Just like you 

What you got it's what you need
There's pain in that but it's plain enough to see
I know I was satisfied
But nobody else came out of my side 

I hope someone will come today
Somebody like you
Someone to take me all the way
Somebody like you
Someone to take your place
Somebody like you
Someone to fill this empty space
