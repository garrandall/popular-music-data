Freedom come, Freedom go
Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, Freedom stay
Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along

Daddy is a doctor, Mother is a debutante
Pillars of societyLiving in a mansion somewhere in the country
And another in Chelsea
Freedom is a rich girl, daddy's little sweet girl
Pretty as a sunny day
Freedom never does do what she doesn't want to
Freedom never has to pay

Freedom come, Freedom go
Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, Freedom stay
Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along

Freedom is her name and freedom is her nature
Running all around the town
Everybody wants to and everybody tries to
But nobody can hold her down
Freedom is so kind and Freedom is so gentle
Freedom is a happy day
Freedom what would you do if I said I love you?
Freedom would you run away?

Freedom come, Freedom go. Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, Freedom stay. Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along

Freedom come, Freedom go
Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, Freedom stay
Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
