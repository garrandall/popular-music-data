When the freedom you've know has left you a broken man
When everything you've ever owned slipped thru your hands
Well it don't really matter at all and you don't give a damn
Oh the fortunes that shackled the heart and the soul of a man
Some men search for silver some men look for gold
But you have found a treasure their pockets will never hold
Some men look forever and still they never find
They don't know that freedom is just a state of mind

When you've burned all your bridges and you've covered all your tracks
Well it goes with out sayin' there's never no turnin' back
When the highway to nowherehas finally came to an end
Well they might think you're crazy when you tell 'em you'ed do it again
Some men search for silver...
