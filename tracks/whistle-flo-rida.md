Broken bitch, without me you are the nothing
You know it better than me definitely
I'm so popular æ©å·²ç»legendary


I'm drinkin' Evian when I wake up
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I can't feel ya
You can blow my whistle like I'm Flo Rida
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga


Purp smoke to the chest, choke that motherfucker, uh
Choker on me, they think I might choke a motherfucker
This me stating, underdogs ain't joking motherfucker, uh
Just to get sleepy, sippin' on syrup
Like rubbin' up under my covers, bitch
Bet I can fuck your mother
I'm sharp like a fucking cutter
She wet like the fucking gutters
And just like a nature lover
I'm wishing a nigga would've
Before his bitch start to suck it
I stop and remind her to ask to pucker
I-I-I am a motherfucker
And Craig is a chicken plucker
He told me your bitch's booty is hubba bu-bubba bubba
She told me that when you fuck her
She boo you just like the ruckus
I hate niggas, Uncle Ruckus
They goofy and bubble blowers
Ayy bitch, this is my hypothesis, uh
Photosynthesis upon the pussy lips, uh
Curved like the beak on the face of pelican, uh
Hole in your body size hippopotamus, water
Ten toe rings, Prince of Persia pimp limp
Put a hole in a nigga just like a cartilage, uh
They thought I didn't come from the bottom bitch, mm
But they say I worked for this spot like a bottom bitch, bitch



Whole lotta gang shit, yuh
Ay, pew pew, a-gling-gling-gling
Dangerous huh, more dangerous
Know what Iâm sayin'?


Iâm drinkin' Evian when I wake up
Broke-ass bitches, I canât feel ya
You can blow my whistle like Iâm Flo Rida
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga
Iâm drinkin' Evian when I wake up
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I canât feel ya
You can blow my whistle like Iâm Flo Rida
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga


All our shows sold out, Iâm over here enjoying a money dance
Wishlist all ticked off, need purple shit, drink soda
LV sexier than Gucci, young daddy, young body, young boss
Open up my laptop to find what Iâm searchin' for, searched for higherganggang.com
Got all these girls' attention, livin' life without no worries
Successful cause I work hard, making bank so youâre jealous
Iâm just living life, I donât really wanna go home
Whose lipstick is on my neck? You should call me on my cell phone
Flexing time, take off my jacket
You donât see the real me, youâre in love with my appearance
Known on the Internet as Snorlax
I can drink two double cups in one gulp
Double star, turn up my volume, this shit so hot, pop another bottle of champagne
Standing on stage, yeah, I feel so great, I believe I can fly like Iâm R. Kelly


Iâm drinkin' Evian when I wake up
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I canât feel ya
You can blow my whistle like Iâm Flo Rida
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga


Arrogant and conceited, sixty degrees below zero
Canât feel the temperature of my heart which is grim
Just like Schumacher driving F1 and not making mistakes
On television programs, until the end
Nobody can fuck with me, play with mouth and skin
Drawing brush can kill you without any effort
I was born in paradise but my life has forever been in hell
Renminbi and U.S. dollars put into the bank and gaining interest
Chains on my neck, thatâs real 24k
Diamond shining like a star flashing until the eyes tear
And with different women drinking in different bars
Trash trash trash, Iâm talking about everyone sitting here
Iâm fire like an AK-47
My brothers and I do things in the manner of savages
Taking things that belong to me, thereâs also people waiting for me
I like to make impossible things a possibility
Forgot, she forgot, she forgot, she left her room and forgot was she called for
Only remembering that I fucked her all night, turn on the beat and write 8 bars
Broken bitch, without me you are the nothing
You know it better than me definitely
Iâm so popular, already legendary


Purp smoke to the chest, choke that motherfucker, uh
Choker on me, they think I might choke a motherfucker
This me stating, underdogs ainât joking motherfucker, uh
Just to get sleepy, sippin' on syrup
Like rubbin' up under my covers, bitch
Bet I can fuck your mother
Iâm sharp like a fucking cutter
She wet like the fucking gutters
And just like a nature lover
Iâm wishing a nigga wouldâve
Before his bitch start to suck it
I stop and remind her to ask to pucker
I am a motherfucker
And Craig is a chicken plucker
He told me your bitchâs booty is hubba bu-bubba bubba
She told me that when you fuck her
She boo you just like the ruckus
I hate niggas, Uncle Ruckus
They goofy and bubble blowers
Ayy bitch, this is my hypothesis, uh
Photosynthesis upon the pussy lips, uh
Curved like the beak on the face of pelican, uh
Hole in your body size hippopotamus, water!
Ten toe rings, Prince of Persia pimp lip
Put a hole in a nigga just like a cartilage, uh
They thought I didnât come from the bottom bitch, mm
But they say I worked for this spot like a bottom bitch, bitch!
