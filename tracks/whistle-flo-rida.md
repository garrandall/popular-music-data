Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go


Look, I'm bettin' you like people
And I'm bettin' you love freak mode
And I'm bettin' you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego
I bet you I'm guilty, your honor
That's just how we live in my genre
Who in the hell done paved the road wider?
There's only one Flo and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer


Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go


Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby


It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shawty don't even know, she can get any for the low
Told me she's not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
Baby, we'll start slow then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
So amusing
Now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it
Even if it's no picture, never lose it


Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go


Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby


Go on, girl, you can twerk it
Let me see your whistle while you work it
I'ma lay it back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me
Now, shorty, let that whistle blow-ow-ow-ow
Yeah, baby, let that whistle blow-ow-ow


Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go


Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
