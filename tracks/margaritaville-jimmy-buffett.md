This song is for all the people that's been reviewing our records in different magazines and things and say we sound a lot like Jimmy Buffett because we live in Key West and use Congo drums in our songs. For all those people that live in Key West and are under the misconception that Mr. Buffett live in Key West
We'd like to say there's a lot of things in Key West, as a matter of fact,

There's sailboats and conch shells and palm trees galore,
But Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door
Says Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West any more

Hey smugglers need those Buffett songs, snitching on the sly
Bringing heat where it's already to damn hot to die
Son of a son of a son of bitch, what's all that bullshit for
Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore

Sailing to the Caribbean Jimmy might well be
Pictures up in Rollin' Stone for all the world to see
The rich keep getting richer, the poor they just stay poor
Jimmy Buffett doesn't' live in Key West anymore

Now Jimmy's moved to Malibu with all those other stars
He's not down on Duval Street hangin' out in bars
All them God damned tourist, got to be a bore.
Jimmy Buffett doesn't live here any more

So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffett
Just because I got that island beat
Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean
Me, I kinda grown up on the street
Music's just a way of life, me I'm livin' free
Don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffett shit on me

Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad
Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad
Well they liked Margaritaville, me I liked it too
Someday Jimmy, why don't we just both get drunk and screw
Oh those creepy Mother Fuckers that think music is a whore
Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore

There's sailboats and conch shells and palm trees galore,
But Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door
Jimmy Buffett, he don't live in Key West any more

Alright boys, sound like Jimmy Buffett now
