Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in the shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like children on a playground
Even after that ol' sun went down-

I was either standing in the shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh Darlin; this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's hard to smile-
For the world, for the camera-
And still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with-
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe
And that's one of the things I love about you
But a time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get off this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world
