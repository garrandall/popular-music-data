Ahh, sun city
Sun city
South Africa
South Africa





We're rockers and rappers united and strong

We're here to talk about South Africa we don't like what's going on (tell it)

It's time for some justice it's time for the truth (speak it)

We've realized there's only one thing we can do


We gotta say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
Oh, no, no, no
I, I, I, I, I, I
I ain't gonna play sun city
Everybody say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
No, no, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city



Relocation to phony homelands

Separation of families I can't understand

23 million can't vote because they're black

We're stabbing our brothers and sisters in the back


We're gonna say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
We're gonna say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city



Our government tells us we're doing all we can

Constructive engagement is Ronald Reagan's plan

Meanwhile people are dying and giving up hope

Well this quiet diplomacy ain't nothing but a joke


We're gonna say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
I ain't gonna play, no, no
We're gonna say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
Don't wanna play, don't wanna play





It's time to accept our responsibility

Freedom is a privilege nobody rides for free

Look around the world baby it cannot be denied

Some-somebody tell me why are we always on the wrong side


I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
Will someone tell me what's going on?
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city



Bophuthatswana is far away

But we know it's in South Africa no matter what they say (No matter what they say)

You can't buy me I don't care what you pay

Don't ask me sun city cause I ain't gonna play


We've gotta say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city



Relocation to phony homelands

Separation of families I can't understand

23 million can't vote because they're black

We're stabbing our brothers and our sisters in the back


We've gotta say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
No, no no, no, no
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
We've gotta say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city
No, no, no no no
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play sun city


It ain't that far away
It ain't that far away, sun city
Don't go, no, no, no no no no no
Sun, sun, sun, sun city
Ain't gonna play sun city
Brothers and sisters being stabbed in the back
Don't, not gonna play sun city
