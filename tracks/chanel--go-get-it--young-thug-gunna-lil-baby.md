Anything she want she can get
Anything she want she can get
Anything she want she can get
(Wheezy outta here)


She want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, shine to the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it


Anything you see, you can get it
Here go the keys to the Bentley
When I fuck her, I got good intentions
I just can't get my palms to stop itchin'
Water on me like I live with the fishes
I done ordered every color in tennis
Got the diamonds put in by my dentist
I'ma shine when I'm skinnin' and grinnin'
Ice my watch, I'm not wastin' my time
Gunna dripping with Uzi and Slime
Connect with my bitch like WiFi
I'm in the DM like Cha Cha
I got Ms, I can take care of the southside
I've been bettin' the billionaire ties
Got the Yves Saint Laurent heels in your size
Get the penthouse and fill it with vibes
Got Marc Jacobs, they cover my eyes
She need help, I'ma send her a dime
I can't pour nothing less than two lines
Luxury all the back seats recline
She want me to put that dick in her spine
Take her shoppin' and keep her from cryin'
Give you stones you one of a kind
Got Chanel with the C's on both sides


She want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, shine to the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it


They locked the door when we walk in Fendi
Save the 100's, them dubs, we spendin'
Real dope boy, ain't chargin' no card
New G-Wagon, she already got
Real grown woman, she ain't post her body
Check price tags, you want it, you get it
You a big Thugger fan, he scared to admit it
Gettin' six for a show, I'm handlin' business
LA for a month, get away from the city
Been sippin' this syrup, I'ma need a new kidney
Just tell me where it's at and I'ma go in and get it
'Ever I say, she on it
New Range Rover, she want it
We don't do "no," she on it
Runnin' out of space for the bags in her closet
Runnin' through checks every day, no fraud shit
Rose gold Presidential Rollie look polished
Bad lil' bitch, good brain go to college
You ain't really gotta pay for nothing, I got it
Big bankroll, I ain't totin' no wallet
I don't withdraw, nigga, name deposit
T-Pain, Plies, I call up my shawty, my shawty


She want Chanel, go get it (she want Chanel, go get it)
She want Chanel, go get it (go get it)
She want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it, she want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it, everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it, hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it, the Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it, shine to the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, anything she want she can get it
