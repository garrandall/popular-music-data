(feat. LaTocha Scott)


You say your having a baby
But I don't know if it's mine
It all started from a one night stand
It wasn't part of the plan
But now I see you got an attitude
And you're so confused
You didn't tell me 'bout your man at home
So what you gonna do?


Chillin' in the club on a Saturday night
Saw you across the floor you were looking so fly
I can't believe that you were also looking my way
Yes you were, yes you were
So I stepped to you with my game down tight
Before we knew it, it was on for tonight
So now tell me what's goin' on with you lady


So tell me what's going on
Please don't make me wait
I know you're living with your man
Sleeping with your man
Creepin' with your friends
Saying you wanna get with me

Now boy you know just as well as I do
In order to go half on a baby, it takes two
Yes it does, yes it does, yes it does
And even though I had a man at home
All we ever did was fuss and fight
Things just wasn't right
Sick and tired of being mistreated
Neglected for no reason
When love was all I needed
He didn't care, so I cheated


So this is what's going on
Baby girl, please don't play
I know you're living with your man
Sleeping with your man
Creepin' with your friends
Saying you wanna get with me



 See I know it was never meant to, be you and me
But it's so hard, so hard for me to believe
That I'm having your baby, and it's driving me crazy
 Okay now, I'ma step up and be a real man
But you have to really have to tell me where I stand
Cuz if this is mine (it's yours)
Girl I'm ready (are you ready?)
To take responsibility
