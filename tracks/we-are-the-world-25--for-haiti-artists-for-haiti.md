There comes a time
When we hear the certain call

When the world must come together as one

There are people dying

And it's time to lend a hand to life

The greatest gift of all


We can't go on
Pretending day by day

That someone somehow will soon make a change

We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth you know: love is all we need



We are the world
We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


Well, send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares

So their cries for help
Will not be in vain


We can't let them suffer
No, we cannot turn away

Right now they need a helping hand


Nou sÃ© mond la
We are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives

It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


When you're down and out
And there seems no hope at all

But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall

Well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come when we

Stand together as one


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

Better start giving


There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives

It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


We are the world
We are the children

It's for the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day

So let's start giving


There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving


There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

Come on now let me here you


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

Choice were making
Saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dream's gone
When the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the world united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road you're walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet's singing along


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me


Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in


Nou sÃ© mond la
Nou sÃ© timoun yo


You and I
You and I


Uh, 12 days no water
What's your will to live?

We amplified the love we watching multiply

Feeling like the world's end
We can make the world win

Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Nou sÃ© mond la
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me


Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti
