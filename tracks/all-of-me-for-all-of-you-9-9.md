All of me for all of you
Nothing less will ever do
I can't give you all of me
Not for half of you
All of you for all of me
That's the way it's got to be
I won't give you all of me
Not for half of you
This is the beginning
Of a love for us
We're holding, squeezing
Talking that lovey stuff
I need you, want you
Hoping anyone should be
Allowed to need a love
Anything
Bring to me the
Same thing I'm bringing
Oh, by the way
One more thing, it's

This is the beginning
Of a me and you
Kissy, kissy, kissy
Meaning I love you
Huggy, huggy meaning
No one else will do
I'm your baby as long
As you're my baby too
Let's make this an adventure
Not a trip

That ain't really love
All of me for all of you
Nothing less will ever do
I can't give you all of me
Not for half of you
I'm bringing you a woman
(Nothing less will do)
Bring me a man, hey
I'm bringing you a woman
(Nothing less will do)
Bring me a man

All of me for all of you
Nothing less will ever do
I love you more
Than I did yesterday
You picked a loving
Each and every day
All of me for all of you
Nothing less will ever do
I'll give you loving
That won't rub off of you
Tender sweet love that'll
Knock the socks off of you

Not for half of you
