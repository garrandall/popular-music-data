she sat right down on the sofa
says where have you been?
i been waiting for you
Cause last night I had something so good
these days get so long
and I got nothing to do
i been hangin' around this town on the corner
i been bummin' around this old town so long
i been hangin' around this town on the corner
i been bummin' around this old town way too long
we spend(t) all day getting sober
just hiding from daylight
watching tv
we just look a lot better in the blue light
well you know I gotta get out
well I'm stuck so tight weighed by the chains that keep me
hangin' around this town on the corner
i been bummin' around this old town too long
i been hangin' around this town on the corner
i been bummin' around this old town way too long
this girl listens to the band play
she says where have you been?
I been lying right here on the floor
(right here on the floor)
well I got all this time to be waiting
For what is mine
to be hating
What I am
after the love has faded
Hangin' around this town on a corner
I been bummin' around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on a corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way way way way way too long
way way way way too long
way way way way too long
way way way way too long
(live insert) oh my god I say
get up real early in the morning
don't get up 'till the afternoon
Son, I see the day is dawning?
(she said well get up get dressed get out)
Its almost have past noon?
