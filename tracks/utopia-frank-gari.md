Ah-a-a-ah Utopia
Ah-a-a-ah Utopia Never thought there really was Utopia
The land where every dream you dream comes true
But last night when we shared a kiss
I'm very sure of this
That magic land came in view And I saw golden skies
And birds of paradise
What a fool I'd be to let you go'Specially when I know that Everybody searches for Utopia
But still it's found by just a lucky few
Darling oh how I hope and pray
We'll stay in love this way
Cause I found Utopia when I found you And I saw golden skies
And birds of paradise
What a fool I'd be to let you go'Specially when I know that Everybody searches for Utopia
But still it's found by just a lucky few
Darling oh how I hope and pray
We'll stay in love this way
Cause I found Utopia when I found you
