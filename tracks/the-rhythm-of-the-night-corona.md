This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah

I got a party on my mind
Soon as I step inside the place
I put that boom inside that bass
I put that boom inside that bass
I got that Louis Vuitton swag
Got the club on lock
Got these fools on shock
Ainât gonâ make this party stop
You sexy and you know it with your freaky weaky sound
That body âbout to blow on up like dynamite
I got the peachy neachy Flor da Rocha party all day
From Ibiza down to California

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Oh oh oh, woah oh oh, oh yeah

I wanna take a sip of Patron and pop some bottles of Rozay
Pop some bottles of Rozay
Getting wasted until we pay
I see a lotta sexy peopleâs body dripping when they talk
Body twerking when they drop
Go âhead make it pop

You sexy and you know it with your freaky weaky sound
That body âbout to blow on up like dynamite
I got the peachy neachy Flor da Rocha party all day
From Ibiza over to Miami

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Oh oh oh, woah oh oh, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
Oh oh oh, woah oh oh, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

I donât wanna face the world in tears
Please think again, Iâm on my knees
Sing that song for me, no need to repent

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Oh oh oh, woah oh oh, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
Oh oh oh, woah oh oh, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
