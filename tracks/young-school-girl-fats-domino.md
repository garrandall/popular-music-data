Hey, little school girl
Wake up, sleepy head
Come on, little darling
Get up out of that bed

The school bell is ringing
Vacation time is gone
No more watching the late show
From now on

No more calling
Calling Judy on the telephone
No more going out swimming
Vacation time is gone

Hey, little school girl
Your time is awful short
The tardy bell will catch you
Hurry or you'll be caught

The school bell is ringing
Vacation time is gone
No more watching the late show
From now on
