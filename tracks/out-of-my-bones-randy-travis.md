I'm in need of a remedy
To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme
But I'll do what I have to do
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
And keep walkin' till the hurting stops
Keep walkin' till my temperature drops
Keep walkin' until the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

I'm in need of medicine
Something strong that will work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arms from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still daylight till dawn
Till you're out of my bones

Sweet amnesia
Come and set me free
I just need to
Get you out of me

Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
And keep walkin' till the hurting stops
Keep walkin' till my temperature drops
Keep walkin' until the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones
You're out of my bones
