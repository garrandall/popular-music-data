Everyday is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the nae nae
You talking to a lady
I want a Kanye ye not a Ray J
So that's a no no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo's beat like Dre aye
I already know what you trying to say hey!


You say that you a baller
And I see you trying holla
But that ain't how I was brought up-next
Working for the money
'Cause that what my momma taught me
So yo ass better show me some re-spect



Boss

Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy
Gettin' Oprah dollars


C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T
That's me, I'm confident
Don't want yo compliments
Use common sense
I'm on my Michelle Obama-shhhhhhhhh
Shut yo mouth
Boy I think you know who run this house
I ain't thirstin for no bae...
'Cause I already know watch you trying to say hey!


You say that you a baller
And I see you trying to holla
But that ain't how I was brought up-next
Working for the money
'Cause that's what my momma taught me
So yo ass better show me some re-spect




I pledge allegiance to my independent girls in here

Ooh Baby...

So if you with us, come on lemme hear you say-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Uhuh uhuh
Hey Hey
Uhuh uhuh


Da da la da da
I see you


You say that you a baller
And I see you trying to holla
But that ain't how I was brought up-next (No)
Working for the money
'Cause that's what my momma taught me
So yo ass better show me some re-spect



Ohoooh

Oh
