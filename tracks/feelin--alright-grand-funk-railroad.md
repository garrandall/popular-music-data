I'm sitting here sad and lonely.
Thinkin' 'bout my one and only.
I been sittin' here cryin' my eyes out.
Feelin' sorry for myself 'cause I just don't know what it's all about.
No, I just don't know.

But, I miss my baby.
I'm lookin' for a lady.
Said I miss my baby.
I think I'm goin' crazy.
Well, I miss my baby.
I'll die without her maybe...yeah, yeah.
I'm lookin' for my baby.
Alright, 'n allright.

I never had a lick of worry.
'Cause she was always in a hurry.
She was eager just to please her baby.
But, I miss her and it's drivin' me crazy.
Oh so crazy.

But, I miss my baby.
I'm lookin' for a lady.
Said I miss my baby.
I think I'm goin' crazy.
Well, I miss my baby.
I think I'll join the navy...yeah, yeah.
I'm lookin' for my baby.
Alright, alright, yeah.

I miss my baby.
I'm lookin' for a lady. Yeah.
Said I miss my baby.
I think I'm goin' crazy.
I miss my baby. Yeah.

Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ...
Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ...
Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ...
Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ...
Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ... Ohhhh ...
