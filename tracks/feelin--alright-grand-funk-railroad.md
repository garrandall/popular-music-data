Seems I got to have a change in scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way things used to be, yeah
Left here on my own or so it seems
I got to leave before I start to scream
'Cause somebody locked the door and took the key

CHORUS
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself

Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo-ooo

Baby, you sure took me on one big ride
And, even now I sit and wonder why
Then, when I think of you, I start to cry
I know I can't get upset and I must keep dry
I got to stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause I got too much to do before I die

CHORUS

Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo-ooo

CHORUS

Oh, yeah

CHORUS

Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo-ooo
