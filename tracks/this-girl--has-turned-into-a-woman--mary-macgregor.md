Wake up
The morning's over
The bed is soft and warm
Where we lay

I've dreamed the whole night through
Of how I'd say to you
All the things
My heart wants to say

Last night
You heard me crying
'Cause I had never loved a man
Before

And I guess the tears were falling
'Cause the little girl was lost
But now love
I'm not crying any more

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life

This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness
Last night

I've never a man
Lying on my pillow
I've never seen your body
Without clothes

I can't believe
These feelings I've discovered
Though I'm sure it's just
What every lover knows

Now I'm offering to you
I make a promise
And? Was gone tomorrow
Don't pretend

But right now I'm in love
And that's all I'm thinking of
And I hope this feeling
Never ever ends

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life
This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness last night

And I want to love you
Once again
Tonight
