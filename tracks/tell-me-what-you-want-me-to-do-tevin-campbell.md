I love you girl 
You called me up and I came to see you 
You say you've been awake all night 
It hurts me deep inside when I see you cryin' 
Whatever's wrong, I'll make it right 


If you understand how I feel 
You should know that my love is real 


Tell me what you want me to do 
My love is always here for you 
Tell me what you want me to do 
My love is always here for you 
So tell me what you want me to do 

Tell me girl 
There were times when I didn't show it 
Just how much I care for you 
I'm so sorry 
Now don't keep sayin' it's too late...to think it's over baby 
After all that we've been through 


Girl, I'm beggin' you 
I'm down on my knees 

Don't walk away baby please don't leave me now 




Girl I know that we can work it out somehow 
Isn't that what love is all about 
I'm gonna be by your side 
We're gonna see it through this time 
I won't let you slip away 
Say you'll stay with me 
Stay with me girl 
'Cause you're the finest girl that I've ever seen 


Tell me, tell me what you want me to do baby 
My love is only here for you and only you 
Tell me what you want me to do 
My love is always here for you 
So tell me what you want me to do 
So tell me what you want me to do
