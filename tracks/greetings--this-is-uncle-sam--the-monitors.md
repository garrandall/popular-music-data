Greetings
This is Uncle Sam
I want to take you
To a far off land

I need you
Oh, I need you
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand

Said goodbye
To all my buddies
Say hello
To your new friends
'Cause you're in the army now
And your new life has just begun

I need you
Oh, I need you
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand

I can just see me now
With a rifle in my hand
I'm gonna have to say
Goodbye to my girl
And I hope she doesn't
Find another man
And baby, baby
While I'm away
Please, please write everyday

Oh no, no
Please don't take me, Uncle Sam
You're in the army now

Goodbye, baby
So long, friends
Goodbye, baby
I hope to see you again

I need you
(Come on, boy)
Oh, I need you
(We're gonna make a man out of you)
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand
(This one training
You're not gonna miss)

Come on, boy
Whatta mean you've never heard of KP
I don't care if it's 4 in the morning
There is a right way
A wrong way
And there's my way
You'll do it my way

Come on, boy
On the double
Get in step, boy
Come on, now
March, march

Your mama's a long ways off, boy
So stop your crying
March
Get in step, boy
Left, right
Left, right
I said get in step, boy
Left
