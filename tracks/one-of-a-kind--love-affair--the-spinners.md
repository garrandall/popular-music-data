One of a kind love affair is
The kind of love
That you read about 
In a fairy tale
Like the sun that shines 
On a rainy day
It's a cloud of love

One of a kind love affair is 
When your down is up
When your up is down 
But love stays around
And when you know you're right
But you got to make 
A little sacrifice
You make it for love
Whoa, yeah

I never thought about today would come
When she would leave without goodbye, yes, sir
She wrote a line or two upon the wall
Said, I'm leaving you
Know I love you, too
I can't stay with you
And to this very day
I could never say 
A discouraging word
Because I love you
Whoa, yes, sire, now

One of a kind love affair is
When you hate to say
Girl, I told you so
But you got to go
There won't be a fight
'Cause your love is right
But you're leaving wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

(One of a kind love affair is)
When you treat her nice 
But you finally have 
To pay the price
And though you know you're right
But you got to make 
A little sacrifice
You make it for love
You make it for love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

One of a kind love affair is
Makes you want to love her
You just got to have her, yeah

One of a kind, one of a kind love affair is
Makes a lame man walk
Makes a blind man talk about seeing again

(One of a kind love affair is)
It makes you me want to be around you
Ah, girl, I'm glad I found you

(One of a kind love affair is)
Wooh-ee, baby  I wanna tell you now
Every day is sunshine
Girl, you're on my mind

One of a kind, one of a kind love affair is
Makes me want to, want to be with you
