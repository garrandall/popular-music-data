In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, "Boy, hurry to Sunday school"

Filled with her load of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Some times she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh, Sadie (oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you (she'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (sweet Sadie livin' in the past)
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin, yeah

Sadie (My, my, my, my, my)
Don't you know we love you (I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)

Sweet Sadie (how you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (It's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie (all the love you showed)
Place no one above you (oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

Sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Ain't it funny that in the end it's not money
It's just the love you gave us all
