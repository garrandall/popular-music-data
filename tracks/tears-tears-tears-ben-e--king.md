Tears, Tears, Tears
Ben E. King
Just before the sun is ready to say goodnight
And the moon comes out of hiding to share its light
I think about the things we used to do
The way you held me when our love was new
But its no use in going back thru the years
Theres nothing left for me but tears, tears, tears, tears
Everywhere I go it seems I see your smiling face( smiling face)
But when I get home theres nothing but empty space
That single cigarette we used to share
The time we wasted when I thought you cared
How can I face this life without you near
A life that only holds tears, tears, tears, tears
Whod ever thought we would be going, going our separate ways
We promised love forever but where, oh, where is love today... ( love today)
Do, do, do, do
Darling if youd ever change your mind
Come back and we will leave the past behind
Ill wipe away your doubt, dispel all your fears
But please don't leave me here with tears, tears, tears, tears
But even though my heart is breaking I wish you love
May you find the happiness that we both dreamed of
Do, do, do, do
