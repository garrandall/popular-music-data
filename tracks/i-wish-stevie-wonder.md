Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine, oh
Greeted at the back door
With, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind


I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so


Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight


I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
