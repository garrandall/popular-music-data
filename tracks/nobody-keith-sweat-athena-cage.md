I want to tease you
I want to please you
I want to show you baby
That I need you

I want your body
'Till the very last drop
I want you to holler
When you want me to stop

And who can love you like me (nobody)
Who can sex you like me (nobody)
Who can treat you like me now, baby (nobody)
Nobody, baby (nobody)
And who can do it like me (nobody)
And who can give you what you need (nobody)
Who can do you all night long (nobody)
Nobody, baby (nobody)


I want the night
For me and you
So come here baby
And let me do it to you

Don't be afraid
'Cuz I won't bite
I promise to give it to you
Just the way you like

And who can love you like me (nobody)
Who can sex you like me (nobody)
Who can lay your body down (nobody)
Nobody, baby (nobody)
And who can treat you like me (nobody)
Who can give you what you need (nobody)
And who can do you all night long (nobody)
Nobody, baby (nobody)
And the band keeps playing on


On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
Nobody, baby
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
Nobody baby

I want you right now for my lover
Oh yes I do
Place no one above you
Oh yes I do
If you need love
I'll be right
I'll be right there, baby
Oh yes I will
Oh yes I will baby
Oh yes I will baby

And who will love you like me (nobody)
Who can sex your body like me baby (nobody)
Who can do it like me, baby (nobody)
No, no, no (nobody)
Who can lay you down just like me (nobody)
Who can kiss you all over your body, baby (nobody)
