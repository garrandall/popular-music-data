I can love you in the mornin'
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you every second
To the ends of the earth
Where needing you's the only thing that's on
My broken one track mind


Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back


I could write a thousand letters
Call a hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still won't change the way things really are
Won't bring you back again


Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back


I can love you for all I'm worth
To the ends of the earth
But I just can't love you back
