Shame Shame Shame
WORDS AND MUSIC BY SYLVIA ROBINSON
Shame shame shame on you
If you can't dance too
REPEAT
Can't stop me now hear what I say
My feet wanna move so get out my way
I'm gonna have my say
I'm going to every discotheque
I'm gonna dance dance dance dance oh
Till the break of day I say
CHORUS
Shame shame shame hey shame on you
If you can't dance too
I say shame shame shame
Shame shame shame
Shame shame on you
If you can't dance too
Don't stop the motion
If you get the notion
You can't stop the groove
'Cos you just won't move
Got my sun-roof down
Got my diamonds in the back
So put on your shaky wig baby
If you don't I ain't comin' back
REPEAT CHORUS
If you don't want to go
Remember one monkey don't stop no show
My body needs action ain't gonna blow
Yes I'm going out I'm going to find a dancin' man
If you really think you're fast
Try to catch me if you can
I say shame shame shame yeah (ah) shame on you
If you can't dance too
It's a shame shame shame
Shame shame shame
Shame shame on you
If you can't dance too
If you can't dance
REPEAT CHORUS
(Shame) said shame (shame) said shame
(Shame) shame on you
If you can't dance too if you can't dance
REPEAT TO FADE
