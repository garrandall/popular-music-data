I slept on your side of the bed yesterday
I don't understand why I can't forget you
I know I messed up when I missed your birthday
We both broke the code
Didn't think I'd ever see you go


I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold
I hope you know...


This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds


Well, fuck you
You can leave with everything you came with
All that shit about me you was sayin' (Well, fuck you)
Everything you are today you made it
Can't believe I fell for all your fake shit (Well, fuck you)


I'm kinda glad that it's over I found
A better half I hope that hurts you
I heard you moved back to New Orleans somehow
We spoke on the phone
Asking me where we went wrong


You wonder if I, ever loved you
Cause if I did, why be so cold?
I hope you know...


This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds


Tried to stitch it up
Had no luck
Keep bleeding out for love


I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold
I hope you know...


This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds


Well, fuck you!
You can leave with everything you came with
All that shit about me you was sayin' (Well, fuck you)
Everything you are today you made it
Can't believe I fell for all your fake shit (Well, fuck you)
