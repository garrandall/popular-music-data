I've been standin' here, for oh so long
Tryin' to figure out girl, where we went wrong
Standin' here, on the edge of time
Waitin' for you baby, I might change your mind

But maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
Oh and maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on

'Cause you and me took the love so far
Had a beautiful thing that somehow went wrong
A whole lotta laughs have turned into tears
Turn your head around, we've been through some years

And maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
And maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on
Maybe I'm a fool and maybe you're right
But I'll never really change and I don't wanna fight

You say, "No, no, no, no"
You keep sayin', "No, not now"
I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
You keep no, no, no, no
But I can't let you go now baby
You got mad, I got mad, don't we really care?

Well now, maybe I'm a fool still lovin' you
And maybe I'm wrong 'cause I'm still hangin' on
And maybe I'm a fool and maybe you're right
But I'll never really change and I don't wanna fight

Maybe maybe, baby baby I'm a fool
Maybe maybe maybe I should stop lovin' you
Huh, maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
Maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on, I say

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Woah oh

I wanna say again

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Woah oh
