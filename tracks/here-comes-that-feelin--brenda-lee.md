Morning's breakin' and here we lie
Too much in love to let sleep close our eyes
We turned a page of life
When we shared our love last night
The dream from far behind us
Just came true to find us
Lying here in each other's arms
High on a feelin' of love bein' born
I've had a dream to love you this way
Since the day

(We were) Cowboys and Indians
On broomstick horses
Chasing the ice cream man
Clutching pennies in our hand
When our love began

We ventured into each other's life
Not really knowin' if love would survive
Till we caught that rainbow
We chased in our minds
Since the day

(We were) Cowboys and Indians
On broomstick horses
Chasing the ice cream man
Clutching pennies in our hand
When our love began
