Wish I knew what was going wrong
Seems so very long since we laughed together
It's no good to be all alone
When you hurt a friend
And you both feel empty
What I'd give to erase the pain
Will we ever make friends
Is it over or shall we try again
For a brand new love affair
Seems to me
We are both afraid
That our love may fade and we just won't make it
Maybe soon we'll be friends again
Find ourselves and then
Really make it happen
What I'd give to erase the pain
Will we every make friends
Is it over or shall we try again
For a brand new love affair
Start all over again
And do it up the right way
Come together my friend
And celebrate the new day
I can hardly believe
How much I really love you baby
All our tomorrows will be
A love affair with you my lady
