If you hurt me you won't be the first or the last in the lifetime of many mistakes
But I won't spend tomorrow regreting the past for the chances that I didn't take
Cause I'll never know till it's over if I'm right or I'm wrong loving you
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done than for something that I didn't do

When you touch me it's easy to make me believe tomorrow won't take you away
But I'll gamble whatever tomorrow might bring of a life that I'm living today
Cause I'll never know
