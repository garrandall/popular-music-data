Too much candy on my ride (ride)
Too many rumors I done died (died)
Too many haters on this surface

Started off real small (real small)
But now my mail is tall (tall)
Had to walk before I crawled
I had my back against the wall (back against the wall)
Two faces not us, two faces at once, gritting it getting it in
Hustlers R Us, never no punk, I'll 2 Step on yo' chin
