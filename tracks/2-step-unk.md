See We Going Form A Line
And We Going Step It Right
Now Step It To The Left
Girl You Know You Dynamite
Now Have Some Good Times
I See You Got It Right
Beat My Wrist Ice
Colder Than A Bud Light
Now I'mma Take My Time
Where The Gangsters At
And You Can Still Post The Wall Nigga Holla Back
Grey Goose And Yak
Blunt Filled With Kush

Smoking On That George Bush

And Don't Be Stepping On My Shoes
