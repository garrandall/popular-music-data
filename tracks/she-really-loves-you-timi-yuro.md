She really loves you and how could you know
How she has waited for you to show her
How much you love her and what you would do
If she was your girl?

Now she really loves you, don't make her wait
Pick up the phone right now before it's too late
And tell her you need her, oh, tell her you care
And she'll be your girl

You'll never know the tears she would cry
If you would tell her, tell her a lie
Be sure you mean, mean all that you say
I know her heart, her heart can't be led astray

She really loves you, what else, what else can I say
You've heard my story, now you don't, you don't walk away
Oh, there's just one more thing before you go
I'm the girl who really loves you so

I love you, I love you, I love you
