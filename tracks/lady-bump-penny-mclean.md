Hey
I'm so glad you come in here tonight. I'm so itchin' to
Dance I can't stand it and I was countin' on dancin' with you

It's a Saturday night and I feel all right
So come on
Let's dance - look at me
All I wanna do is to bump with you
So come on
Let's dance - look at me tonight
When we hear the music play you might
Learn from me in every way

They call me Lady Bump
Lady Bump it's no lie - ah
Lady Bump
Lady Bump - just the music takes me high

They call me Lady Bump
Lady Bump uh uh uh ah
Lady Bump
Lady Bump look at me and you'll know why

No
I don't need a break 'cause my hips got to shake -
Ooh come on
Let's dance - look at me
When I feel your touch - baby
It's too much
Ooh come on
Let's dance - look at me tonight...

They call me Lady Bump
Lady Bump it's no lie - ah...

They call me Lady Bump
Lady Bump uh uh uh ah...

They call me Lady Bump
Lady Bump uh uh uh ah...
