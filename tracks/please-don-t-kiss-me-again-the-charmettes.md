Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Please don't kiss me again
Let's not start it all over

Instead of kissing
We'll just shake hands
And say goodnight
And we'll be all right

Please don't kiss me again
You know I'm weak to temptation

We're gonna play it
As cool as we can
Just wink an eye
And we'll say goodbye

They all say we're
Not meant to be lovers
That we'll get along just fine
Like sister and brother, oh, yes

So please don't kiss me again
One kiss leads to another
No, no, no, don't do it again
Cause if you do
I'll just keep loving you

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

They all say we're
Not meant to be lovers
That we'll get along just fine
Like sister and brother, oh, yes

So please don't kiss me again
One kiss leads to another
No, no, no, don't do it again
Cause if you do
I'll just keep loving you

Please don't kiss me again
Please don't kiss me again
Please don't kiss me again...
