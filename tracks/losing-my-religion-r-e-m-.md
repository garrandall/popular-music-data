Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up


That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try


Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up


Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try


But that was just a dream
That was just a dream


That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try


But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream
