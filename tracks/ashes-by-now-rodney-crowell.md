This mornin' is Monday
Where are you now?
Teasin' my memory
Teachin' me how
To lay low
When I don't want to

Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's makin' me crazy
Leavin' me out
In the open
When I don't want to

The moments of pleasure
Never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone
And in a hurry

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

The second street beggars
Alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk
To hide from the night
Like I am
They're just like I am

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now
