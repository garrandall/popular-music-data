And breakout

When explanations make no sense
When every answer's wrong
You're fighting with lost confidence
All expectations gone

The time has come to make or break
Move on, don't hesitate
And breakout

Don't stop to ask
And now you've found a break to make at last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
Breakout

When situations never change
Tomorrow looks unsure
Don't leave your destiny to chance
What are you waiting for
The time has come to make your break
Breakout

Don't stop to ask
And now you've found a break to make at last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
Breakout...

Don't stop to ask
Now you've found a break to make at last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
Breakout

Some people stop at nothing
If you're searching for something
Lay down the law
Shout out for more
Breakout and shout
Day in day out
Breakout

Breakout

Don't stop to ask
And now you've found a break to make at last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
And breakout

Don't stop to ask
And now you've found a break to make at last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
And breakout...

(Don't) Lay down the law (stop)
Shout out for more (to ask)
Breakout and shout day in day out
Oh, breakout

Breakout

Breakout

Lay down the law
Shout out for more
Breakout and shout day in day out
