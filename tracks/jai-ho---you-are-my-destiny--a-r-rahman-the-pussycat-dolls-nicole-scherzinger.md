Jai Ho! Jai Ho!


I got shivers
When you touch away
I'll make you hot, get all you got
I'll make you wanna say
(Jai Ho!)
(Jai Ho!)
I got fever
Running like a fire
For you, I will go all the way
I'm gonna take you higher
(Jai Ho!)
I keep it steady
'Cause steady is how I feel it
(Jai Ho!)
This beat is heavy, so heavy
You gon' feel it


(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I breathe
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I still believe
(Jai Ho!)
You are my destiny (my destiny)
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
(Jai Ho!)
No, there is nothing that can stop us
(Jai Ho!)
Nothing can ever come between us
(Jai Ho!)
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho!


Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me
I want you now
I know you can save me, come and save me
I need you now
I am yours forever, yes, forever
I will follow
Anywhere in anyway
Never gonna let go
(Jai Ho!)


(Jai Ho!)
Escape (escape) away (away)
I'll take you to a place
This fantasy of you and me, I'll never lose the chase
(Jai Ho!)
I can (I can) feel you (feel you)
Rushing through my veins
There's an ocean in my heart, I will never be the same
(Jai Ho!)
Just keep it burnin', yeah, baby
Just keep it comin'
(Jai Ho!)
You're gonna find out, baby
I'm one in a million


(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I breathe (that I breathe)
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I still believe (I still believe)
(Jai Ho!)
You are my destiny
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
(Jai Ho!)
No, there is nothing that can stop us
(Jai Ho!)
Nothing can ever come between us
(Jai Ho!)
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho! (You and me, it's destiny)


Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me
I want you now
I know you can save me, come and save me
I need you now
I am yours forever, yes, forever
I will follow
Anywhere in anyway
Never gonna let go
(Jai Ho!)


(Jai Ho!)
(Jai Ho!)
I need you
Gonna make it
(Jai Ho!)
I'm ready
So take it!


(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I breathe (that I breathe)
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I still believe (I still believe)
(Jai Ho!)
You are my destiny (my destiny)
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
(Jai Ho!)
No there is nothing that can stop us (stop us)
(Jai Ho!)
Nothing can ever come between us
(Jai Ho!)
So come and dance with me
