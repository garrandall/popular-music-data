Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore


I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are


Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care


I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are


I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you


I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are




I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
