When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And if I know he is worried
Then I would feel that same misery

We've been through, oh yeah
So much together
We stand as one
And that's what makes it better

When something is wrong with my baby, oh yeah
Something is wrong with me

Just what, oh yeah, he means to me now
Oh you just wouldn't understand
And the people say he's no good
But oh, I am his woman
And I know he's my man

And if he's got a problem
Ooh, Lord I know, I got to help him solve it

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
Ho, say it again
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
Hey
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
