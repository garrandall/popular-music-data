When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And if I know she is worried
Oh, I know I would feel the same misery


But we've been through so much together
We stand as one
And that's what makes it better


When something is wrong with my baby, oh Lord
Something is wrong with me
And that ain't all, y'all


Just what, mhm, she means to me now
Oh, you just wouldn't, oh no, you just wouldn't understand
People can say that she ain't no good
Oh, she's my woman
And I know that I'm still her man


And if she's got a problem
Oh-oh, I know I'm gonna help her solve them


When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me


We wanna do it one more time
When something is wrong with my baby
Oh-oh
Something is wrong with me, oh
When something is wrong with my baby
