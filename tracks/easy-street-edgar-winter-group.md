Easy Street
Saturday night at the corner cafe
Had me some drinks and Im feelin my way
Moons on the rise and it looks like a night for romance.........
Shufflin down past the local hotel
Doin the rounds like Im under a spell
Must be the place
Yes I knew when she asked me to dance.........
Im on Easy, Easy Street.........
Im on Easy, Easy Street.........
Seein as how Im a regular guy
Watchin the girls of the evening go by
Got me a chance so Im takin it, makin it last.........
Im on Easy, Easy Street.........
Im on Easy, Easy Street.........
So if youre feelin like youre a lonely man
And when ever you are down and need a gentle hand.........
Theres always Easy Street you know you got it planned
But just remember boy
Its only a one night stand.........
Thats all.........
Think Ill make it anyway.........
Thats where its at.........
