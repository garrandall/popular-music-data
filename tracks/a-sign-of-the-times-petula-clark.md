It's a sign of the times
That your love for me is getting so much stronger
It's a sign of the times
And I know that I won't have to wait much longer

You've changed a lot somehow
From the one I used to know
For when you hold me now
I feel like you never want to let me go

It's a sign of the times
That you call me up whenever you feel lonely
It's a sign of the times
That you tell your friends that I'm your one and only

I'll never understand 
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand 
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

Mm mm mm

I'll never understand
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

It's a sign of the times
That you kiss me now as if you really mean it
It's a sign of the times
And a year ago I never could have seen it

Don't ever change your mind
And take your love away
Just leave the past behind
And, baby, only think of how it is today

It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times 
It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times
It's a sign of the times
