That's what I thought you said
Now let me offer this as a rebuttal
Ayy, yuh, ayy, okay
Okay, yuh

I got a lot of blue money, new money is racks
Do a show, gimme cash, I ain't payin' no tax
I copped the racks for the day and I counted up ten
Put them racks real estate, multiply it by ten
Niggas subtweet me, I'ont never get tagged
Why you worried about me, go and get you a bag
These niggas broke, no money, miss meals, they weak
Forty hours at yo job wouldn't equal my feet, bitch

But I'm that nigga, shoutout YBN, young nigga flexin'
Transfer two hunnid bands from my savings to my checking
Big money, I been livin' great, Bora Bora with' it
I know these pussy niggas fans of me, go ahead, admit it
 bands in my sleep, work when it's sunny
I done blew up off the 'Tube young nigga funny
Now it's music, my niggas movin' pack like some units
It's confusin', I do not know which bank I be usin'
Too much money, these niggas broke, dusty, and bummy
So I be snatchin' on they bitches then I chew 'em like gummies
It's DDG, get familiar, I be purposely flexin'
And when yo bitch on her phone, I'm the one she be textin'
Watch yo step, these red bottoms cost me a future
Don't touch my wrist, this AP froze like a cooler
These niggas hoes, they only tough over computers
That goofy act like he own but he really a loser
Why I always wear this chain? 'Cause it cost me a fortune
Why yo bitch freakin' on me? 'Cause I'm fuckin' important
She see the ice on my neck, see the splash on my wrist
Sloppy toppy, take her home, then you give her a kiss
Niggas hatin' in my comments but I keep gettin' riches
The only niggas that'll hate got no profile picture
'Cause you a lame, you a fuckin' stain', you should be ashamed
You be cappin' like you shootin', you ain't even got no aim
I ain't really with the beefin' 'less I'm gettin' a check
Cashed out, put 25K on my neck
Yo bitch told me told me, "Come over," told her, "Gimme a sec,"
Speedin' in the i8, almost got in a wreck
Skrt, skrt! Ring, ring- "Be here by eleven,"
I told her, "Why you rushin' me? I'll be there in a second."
I walked in, she butt naked, then I fucked her to seven
I asked her why she keep cheatin'- "'Cause my ex is a peasant."

I got a lot of blue money, new money is racks
Do a show, gimme cash, I ain't payin' no tax
I copped the racks for the day and I counted up ten
Put them racks real estate, multiply it by ten
Niggas subtweet me, I'ont never get tagged
Why you worried about me, go and get you a bag
These niggas broke, no money, miss meals, they weak
Forty hours at yo job wouldn't equal my feet, bitch
