Talk to her please Mr. Sun
Speak to her Mr. Rainbow
And take her under
Your branches Mr. Tree

Whisper to her Mr. Wind
(Whisper to her)
Sing to her Mr. Robin
And Mrs. Moonlight
Put in a word for me

(Talk to her)
(Talk to her)

Tell her how I feel
(Tell her how I feel)
It shouldn't end this way
(Shouldn't end this way)
Since you are all her friends
She'll listen to what you say

Tell it to her Mr. Moon
(Tell it to her)
Kiss her for me Miss Raindrop
And watch to see they all do
Please Mr. Sun

(Talk to her)
Please Mr. Sun
(Talk to her)
Mr. Sun
