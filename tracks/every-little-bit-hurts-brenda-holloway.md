Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts


Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go


Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts


You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you


I can't take this
Loneliness you've given me
I can't go on
Giving my life away


Oh, come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the
Things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me, yeah


Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts


To you, I'm a toy
And you're the boy
Who has to say
When I should play
Yet you hurt me, desert me


Come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the
Things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me, yeah


Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
