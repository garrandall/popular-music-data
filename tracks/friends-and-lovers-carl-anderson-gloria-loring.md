What would you think if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you?
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

Yes, it's a chance that we're taking
And somebody's heart may be breaking
But we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

I've been through you
And you've been through me
Sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
We always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find

So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
Well, I know in our heart we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Other
