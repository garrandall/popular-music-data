Alright, come on, sing it one time
(Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sing, oww (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ha, ha


Walked in this place, surprised to see
A big girl gettin' busy, just rockin' to the go-go beat
The way she shook her booty sho' looked good to me
I said, 'Come here, big girl, won't you rock my world?
Show that dance to me'


She was doin' the butt, hey pretty, pretty
When you get that notion
Put your backfield in motion, hey
Doin' the butt, hey sexy, sexy
Ain't nothing wrong
If you wanna do the butt, all night long

(Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What you gonna do about it?
(Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shake it


I took that girl out on the floor
She rocked me from the backside
We did the butt 'til it made me sore
Now, it's a physical thing, but not hard to do
You just shake-a shake, shake, shake, shake-a shake, shake
Doin' the butt the whole night through, come on


She was doin' the butt, hey pretty, pretty
When you get that notion
Put your backfield in motion, hey
Doin' the butt, hey sexy, sexy
Ain't nothing wrong
If you wanna do the butt, all night long


(We got the butt)
D.C. (We got the butt)
L.A., What you got to say (We got the butt)
Philly (We got the butt)
Atlanta (We got the butt)
Baltimore, Won't you come holla at me

Tanya got a big ol' butt (Oh yeah)
Shirley got a big ol' butt (Oh yeah)
Irene got a big ol' butt (Oh yeah)
Teresa got a big ol' butt (Big ol' butt)
Sonya got a big ol' butt (Oh yeah)
Melissa got a big ol' butt (Oh yeah)
Ol' Tammy got a bubble butt(Oh yeah)
Little Keisha got a big ol' butt (Big ol' butt)
Now, gimme the butt!

(Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna drop you lines before we set up
We're screamin' at girls with the big ol' butt, sing it
Oww (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want your butt, that butt, that big ol', big ol' butt, oww


She was doin' the butt, hey pretty, pretty
When you get that notion
Put your backfield in motion, hey
Doin' the butt, hey sexy, sexy
Ain't nothing wrong
If you wanna do the butt, all night long
