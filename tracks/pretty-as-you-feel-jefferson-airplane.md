You're only pretty as you feel
only pretty as you feel inside
you're only pretty as you feel
just as pretty as you feel inside

when you wake up in the morning
rub some sleep from your eye
look inside your mirror
comb your hair

don't give vanity a second chance
no no no
beauty's only skin deep
it goes just so far 'cause
you're only pretty as you feel
you're only pretty as you feel inside
just as pretty as you feel

now you're feelin pretty
now you're feelin good
now you're ready to face the world girl
now you're feelin good
go out there 'n' knock 'em silly girl
go out there 'n' show 'em how ta thrill
'cause you're only pretty as you feel
only pretty as you feel
you're only pretty as you feel
just as pretty as you feel inside
feelin' so pretty, feelin' so pretty
pretty mama.
