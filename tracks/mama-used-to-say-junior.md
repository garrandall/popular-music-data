Ooh
Yeah, girl


Said a small boy once asked
When will I grow up?
When will I see what grown-ups do see?

In his fight to come of age
He would act an older age
To be recognized as one
And not a mass


And mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old

Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say
Live your life


As the years went rushing by
He would cut down on his age
He would tell his girl of how it used to be

How his mommy passed away
But these lines she would say
And at the time
He couldn't understand




You're young
So enjoy
Don't hold on back
Do all you want to do

Now is the time
For you to stride
For you to get better in what you are doing




And mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old

Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say

Live your life
Live your life
Live your life

Hey, mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old

And Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
