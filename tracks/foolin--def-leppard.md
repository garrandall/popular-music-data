Lady Luck never smiles
So lend your love to me, awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill

On and on we rode the storm
The flame has died, the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

Is anybody out there? Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder? Anybody care?

Oh, I just gotta know
If you're really there and you really care
'Cause baby I'm not

F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'
Not f-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'

Won't you stay with me awhile

Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just wakin' up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad

Is anybody out there? Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder? Anybody care?

Oh, I just gotta know
If you're really there and you really care
'Cause baby I'm not

F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'
Not f-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'

Oh, oh, oh oh!

Oh, I just gotta know
If you're really there and you really care
'Cause baby I'm not

F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'
Not f-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'

I'm not fooling myself
(I'm not fooling myself)
No no no
(I'm not fooling myself)
Ah no no
(I'm not fooling myself)
No no no no
(I'm not fooling myself)
No
