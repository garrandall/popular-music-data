Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey


The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied


But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy




The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied


But they couldn't stop Jack, 'or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy


I saw yer!
