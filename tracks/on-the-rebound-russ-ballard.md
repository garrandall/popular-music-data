That's how you fell for me
That's how you changed my life
You cut me like a knife

On the rebound, on the rebound
You came, you saw, you took
It only took one look
And, lady, I was hooked

On the rebound, on the rebound
On the rebound

On the rebound, on the rebound
You came and took my soul
You came and left a hole
Where your love used to be

On the rebound, on the rebound
You like to drown in your tears
And after all these years
You give your pain to me

(On the rebound) You came to me
(On the rebound) To set you free
(On the rebound) Too bad for me
Oh, yeah

When you came
You wanted my money
And when you left me
You took my life, honey

(On the rebound) You came to me (oh)
(On the rebound) To set you free (oh)
(On the rebound) Too bad for me (oh)

Can't stand this pain
Won't you come back again

(On the rebound) You came to me
(On the rebound) To set you free
(On the rebound) Too bad for me
Oh, yeah

Through my tears
Your face still appears

(On the rebound) You came to me
(On the rebound) To set you free
