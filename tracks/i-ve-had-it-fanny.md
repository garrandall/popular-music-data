When I saw you on the corner
Then I knew that I was a goner
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

First you tell me you love me only
Then you go and you leave me lonely
I've had it, well, I've had it

La la la la la...

When you ask me to be your baby
Then you tell me
I'm driving you crazy
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

First you call me for a date
Then you show up two hours late
I've had it, ooh, I've had it

La la la la la...

Come on

When I saw you on the corner
Little did I know
That I was a goner
I've had it, oh, yeah
I've had it

B-b-b-baby you tell me
That you want to
Keep me for yourself
How come I saw you
With somebody else

I've had it, oh, yeah
Said I've had it

La la la la la...

Oh, oh, oh, I've had it
