Now you know me
You know how proud I am
And what I'm gonna tell you now
Won't be easy to say

Before I left your side
Oh, I was so happy then
But I've been so lonely
Since I've been away
Oh, baby

I've tried and I know I can't make it alone
It's such a hard way to go
I just can't make it alone
There's something in my soul
That will always
Lead me back to you

What can I say now?
Sorry is just not good enough
I couldn't blame you if you hurt me now
The way I hurt you then

But who else can I turn to?
Oh, baby, I'm begging you
Won't you reach out for my dying soul?
And make me live again
Oh, baby, it's so hard

I've tried and I know I can't make it alone
It's such a hard way to go
I just can't make it alone
There's something in my soul
That will always
Lead me back to you

Baby, help me
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone
It's such a hard way to go
And I can't make it alone
There's something in my soul
That will always
Lead me back to you

Oh, help me
(Please help me)
You know I need you
(I need you)
I'm saying that I need you
I just can't make it by myself
(I just can't make it by myself)
I just can't make it all alone
(I just can't make it all alone)
I just can't make it by myself
(I just can't make it by myself)
Come on baby
