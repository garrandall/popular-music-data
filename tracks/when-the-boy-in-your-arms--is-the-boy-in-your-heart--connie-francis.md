When the boy in your arms
Is the boy in your heart
Then you've got everything

When you're holding the dream
You've been dreaming you'd hold
You're as rich as a king

So, hold him tight
And never let him go
Day and night
Let him know you love him so

With the love of your life
Spend a life time of love
Make him yours for ever more

So, hold him tight
And never let him go
Day and night
Let him know you love him so

With the love of your life
Spend a life time of love
Make him yours for ever more

Make him yours for ever more
