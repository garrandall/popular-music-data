Ever see a lady
With a sick baby stayin at home from work
On a stayin up all-nighter
That ain't just a momma's son
That's a fighter

Ever see an old man
With a lunch pail 5:00 whistle blowin
And he's goin home tired as hell
That ain't just an old man's son
Yeah, that's a fighter

This is for the
Blue collar
80-hour weekers
Sweat stained heartland
Haggard on the speakers
Kickin ourselves up out of the
Hot august dust in God we trust
Cold beer in the left hand
Right one holdin up a lighter
This one's for you, yeah
This one's for the fighters

Yeah, ever see an 18 wheeler
Cross-country CB talkin
Lack ass hauntin
Pullin a load and keepin it goin
Drivin it like it's stolen
Tryin to get home on the midnight rider
That ain't just a trucker's son
That's a fighter

Talkin 'bout the farmers
Old-catters, ranchers
Ballot dancers
Scientists lookin for the answers
Strong coffee waitin for the golden sunrisers
Broken hearted, given it one more tryers
You ain't a survivor

This is for the
Blue collar
80-hour weekers
Sweat stained heartland
Haggard on the speakers
Kickin ourselves up out of the
Hot august dust in God we trust
Cold beer in the left hand
Friday night catchin' on fire
This one's for you, yeah
This one's for the fighters

This is for the 2 outs
In the bottom of the ninth-ers
The down for the counter
Comin' back to lifers
The I have a dreamer
Blind faith believers
The known that I walkin' on the wires

Blue collar
80-hour weekers
Sweat stained heartland
Haggard on the speakers
Kickin ourselves up out of the
Hot august dust in God we trust
Cold beer in the left hand
Holdin' on a little tighter
This one's for you, yeah
This one's for the fighters
This one's for the fighters
This one's for you, yeah
This is for the fighters
This one's for the fighters
This one's for the fighters
