This is about two cats
They're sittin' down by a river in the swamps
They're sittin' down on the logs
One of them is kind of a big fellow

And the other one is a little bit smaller
And he's got a long billed cap
And they're sittin' there ponderin'
On what they're gonna do for the night

And anything the big guy decides
On the little guy's for
'Cause he digs him, he's cool
So it's called Roosevelt and Ira Lee

The river was dark and muddy
And the moon was on the rise
And all of the creatures in the swampland
Had woke up to feed for the night

Roosevelt and Ira Lee, huh, were sittin' there on a log
Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said
I'd sure like to have a mess of bull frog
He said, yeah, yeah, lawd, sure would taste good

So they slipped on their rubber boots
And walked down to the water's edge
And right away they knew
That the night would be a bummer

'Cause Ira Lee stepped
On a water mossacin
He said, uh, uh, lawd
Somebody help me

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt
When he quit his screamin' and kickin'
And he said, let's forget about the bullfrog legs
And go out and steal us some chickens

And Ol' Roosevelt said like this now
Yeah, yeah, oh it sure would taste good
Yes it would, I love a chicken
Oh, the river was dark and muddy, yeah
