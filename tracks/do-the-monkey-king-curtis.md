The Mekanix

Touched a lot of bands, I hope I think I deserve it
I hope I think I deserve it
This some fucked up shit, lord knows I ain't perfect
Lord knows I ain't perfect
We was gettin' money when they was wearing throwback jersey's
When they was wearing throwback jersey's
I went from ashy to classy, nigga, so fuck Jergens
Nigga, so fuck Jergens
You ain't ever been in the car with niggas with the murder
I ain't ever changed, my nigga, that's on purpose
Ain't enough money in the world, I think it's worth it
Every time I leave shows over closed curtains
Bitch, I don't answer the phone 'cause I be workin'
And they can pull up and get this curbside service
Niggas try and post with the kid but they be nervous
But I'ma Get Rich or Die Tryin' like Curtis

I'm still in the dope game
Made a name off of cocaine
Posted on the corner all night
Fresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower
But who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour
When you was sellin' my momma dope
I was sellin' yo' momma the same thing
Still chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep
I sleep with one eye open
It's the grim reaper chasin' me
It's the grim reaper chasin' me

Nightmares, I wake up in a cold sweat
You a slave to a king, I put a rope no your neck
I ain't nobody, I'm just a nigga who write the checks
Niggas found me in the West, on the corner with crack
Put me in the car, said they needed me in the lab
I had just sold a half, I had zips of some more shit
I was outside grindin', never on no ho shit
'Cause 'round here you get your mothafuckin' dome split
And if a nigga ever run outta crack
Believe, I ain't gon' think twice 'bout puttin' a monkey on your back
And if a nigga ever run outta crack
Believe, I ain't gon' think twice 'bout puttin' a monkey on your back

I'm still in the dope game
Made a name off of cocaine
Posted on the corner all night
Fresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower
But who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour
When you was sellin' my momma dope
I was sellin' yo' momma the same thing
Still chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep
I sleep with one eye open
It's the grim reaper chasin' me
It's the grim reaper chasin' me

Black and tar bags
Niggas know I'ma rockstar
They don't come around 'cause we done paid off the cop cars
We done paid off the cop cars
We done paid off the cop cars
Black and tar bags
Niggas know I'ma rockstar
They don't come around 'cause we done paid off the cop cars
We done paid off the cop cars
We done paid off the cop cars

I'm still in the dope game
Made a name off of cocaine
Posted on the corner all night
Fresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower
But who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour
When you was sellin' my momma dope
I was sellin' yo' momma the same thing
Still chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep
I sleep with one eye open
It's the grim reaper chasin' me
It's the grim reaper chasin' me
