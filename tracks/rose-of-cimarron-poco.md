Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and 
Look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window
Watchin', will they ever show
Can you hear them callin'
You know they have fallen 
On campfires cold and dark 
That never see a spark burn bright

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Trails that brought them home 
Echo names they've known
Four days high and lonely 
Comin' to you only
You're the one they turned to
The only one they knew who'd do
All her best to be around 
When the chips were down

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and 
Look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window
Watchin', will they ever show

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Hearts like yours belong
Following the dawn
Wrapped up in a song
Rose of Cimarron
