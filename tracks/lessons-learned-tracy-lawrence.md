I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy, that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
As daddy showed me wrong from right
He said this hearts me more than it does you
There's some things son, that you just don't do
Is anythings I'm sayin getting through
Is daddy I can see the light

Oh lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh there's no way around it
'Cause this world turns 
on lessons learned

Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive this truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him, 'cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there

Oh lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh there's no way around it
'Cause this world turns
on lessons learned

Oh lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh there's no way around it
'Cause this world turns
on lessons learned
