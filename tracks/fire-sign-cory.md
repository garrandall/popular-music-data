I won't forget, the wonder of how You brought
Deliverance, the exodus of my heart
'Cause You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
O Yahweh

You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh

The cloud by day, is a sign that You are with me
The fire by night, is the guiding light to my feet
'Cause You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
O Yahweh

You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh

You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh

You stepped into my Egypt
And You took me by the hand
And You marched me out in freedom
Into the promised land
And now I will not forget You, no
I'll sing of all You've done
Death is swallowed up forever
By the fury of Your love

'Cause You stepped into my Egypt
And You took me by the hand
You marched me out in freedom
Into the promised land
Now I will not forget You, God
I'll sing of all You've done
Death is swallowed up forever
By the fury of Your love

You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

And You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

'Cause You stepped into my Egypt
You took me by the hand
And You marched me out in freedom
Straight into the promised land
Now I will not forget You, no
I'll sing of all You've done
Death is swallowed up forever
By the fury of Your love
