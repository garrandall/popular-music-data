You can run away
That doesn't worry me
There's no amount of miles
That could fall between you and I
You make my lovin' worthwhile

You can get behind the wheel
And drive your heart out
Take that oldsmobile
And stake your claim
Just to find all that runnins in vain
And it will remain the same

If you should sail upon a ship
I'm gonna stow away
And if the ocean's wide
Baby it'll take a long while
If you should sail out on a trip
Over your shoulder cast an eye
I'll be there wearing a smile

You can change your name
Change your address too
Play that runnin' game
It's nothin' new
Try to hide for all the good it will do
You know it's true

If you should sail upon a ship
I'm gonna stow away
And if the ocean's wide
Baby it'll take a long while
If you should sail out on a trip
Over your shoulder cast an eye
I'll be there wearing a smile

If you should sail upon a ship
I'm gonna stow away
And if the ocean's wide
Baby it'll take a long while
If you should sail out on a trip
Over your shoulder cast an eye
I'll be there wearing a smile
