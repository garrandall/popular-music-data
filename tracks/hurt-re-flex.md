I keep my love in a paper bag
I've got to hide it away
It's very sensitive to the touch
It wasn't always this way
Well, I wanted you, oh-oh-oh, so bad
But you didn't care from the start
Hm, you treated me like your doormat
And walked all over my heart

Well, you made it hurt
You sure know how to hurt
Well, you made it hurt
You sure know how to hurt

I was a victim of circumstances
I was a victim of tease
I got hooked on the sensation
You left me screaming out "please"
How could you do what you did to me
You played with me like a toy
Hm, what you did to my nervous system
I can't say I really enjoyed

You made it hurt
You sure, you sure did hurt
Hm, you made it hurt
You sure, you sure did hurt

Oh, what you did to me, oh
Oh, what you put me through
Oh, what you put me through

Fate has a funny way of turning tables
Somehow positions have changed
Sweet revenge is in the air tonight
It's your turn to feel the pain

I'm gonna make it hurt
I want to make it hurt
I've got to make it hurt
I want to make it hurt

I said it's gonna hurt, hurt
I want to make it hurt, hurt
I'm gonna make it hurt, hurt
I'm gonna make it hurt, hurt, hurt
