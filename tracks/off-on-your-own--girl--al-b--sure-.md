Woo, don't hit me too hard
Oh, yeah
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
To me, to me, woo


All alone you get off
On your own, girl
All alone you get
Off on your own
On your own, girl
On your own, girl
Girl, girl, girl


Don't you leave
Me standing here
What is it
You feel no fear
Let me make it
Up to you, my dear

I'm all alone
Sitting right here
By the phone
My heart is broken now
Believe me, girl, ooh

Wait, wait, you'll see
You'll get used to me
I know you'll love me, girl
(If you give me a chance)

I'm all alone
Sitting right here
By the phone
My heart is broken now
Believe me, girl, ooh




I wanna know
What's on your mind
You're back here running
The same old line
You love me and you care
(Whatever)

I'm all alone
Sitting right here
By the phone
My heart is broken now
Believe me, girl, ooh
Please come home

Is there something
Wrong with you, or is there
Something wrong with me?

Tell me something
Do I not look
Good enough for you?
Or maybe, baby, you just
Look too good for me
Don't sweat yourself
On the strength!




You make me so mad
That you want to be on your own
I waited for so long
I waited by the phone
All of a sudden
You want me back

Ha ha, what's up with that
You got me on hold
What do you think
You dope on a rope, nope

What, I'm supposed to sweat you?
You're supposed to
Just run all over me?
Zero! On the strength
Yo, Scott, it ain't
Hard to tell, right

All the brothers
Grab a girl and
Get out your seat
And rock to the rhythm
Of this funky beat

My name is Al B. Sure
Rock to the rhythm
The rhythm, the rhythm
Of the funky beat

All alone, my girl
Oh, hey, no, no
No, no, no, no
