You say you want to seek the truth, but it's hard to find
No one to help you, your friends don't have the time
So you ride around in your car. switch on the radio
You want to relate to something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look

Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey
Until I got hurt, 'till got hurt, why didn't I
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
'Till I got hurt. baby. I didn't know' what love is

You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
So you turn to any phoney mouth with a tale to tell
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum

Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't I
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is

Young son, don't let me down, young son
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now
Hold on, never let go, now hold on
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way
Cos 'till you make that final show
You'll never know what love you've been missing
Missing

You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone
No one to help you and nobody to push you on
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on
You wait for a miracle, cos you say one day one'll come along
(But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now You might be gone
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong

Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't I
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is

Until I got hurt, oh I didn't know what love is
