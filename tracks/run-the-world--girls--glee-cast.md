Some of them men think they freak this like we do

Disrespect us no they won't 

Boy don't even try to touch this

This goes out to all my girls that's in the club rocking the latest 
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later

None of these people can fade me

Endless power our love we can devour 
You'll do anything for me

It's hot up in here DJ don't be scared to run this run this back 
I'm looking for the girls who're taking over the world have me raise a glass for the college grats 

Anyone rolling I'll let you know what time it is, check

I work my 9 to 5 and I cut my cheque
This goes out to all the women getting it in you on your grind 
To other men that respect what I do please accept my shine 
Boy I know you love it how we're smart enough to make these millions 
Strong enough to bear the children then get back to business 
See, you better not play me don't come here baby 
Hope you still like me if you pay me 

My persuasion can build a nation 
Endless power our love we can devour 
You'll do anything for me
