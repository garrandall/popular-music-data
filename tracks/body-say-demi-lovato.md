If I had it my way, I would take you down
If I had it my way, I would turn you out
And if my body had a say, I would come again
Scared of what I might say, 'cause I'm at the edge

And our eyes are crossing paths across the room
There's only one thing left for us to do

You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland
Take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say
I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth
Baby, I would do
Just what I want to

If I had it my way, I would take the lead
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress

And our eyes are crossing paths across the room
There's only one thing left for us to do

You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland
Take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say
I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth
Baby, I would do
Just what I want to

My mind's getting in the way
Can't feel what my body say
I'mma tell you anyway
I'mma tell you anyway
My mind's getting in the way
Can't feel what my body say
I'mma show you anyway
I'mma show you anyway

There's only one thing left for us to do
Oh, you can

You can touch me with slow hands, yeah
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland
Take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say
I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth
Baby, I would do
Just what I want to

You can touch me with slow hands
Dreamland
If my body had a say
I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth
Baby, I would do
Just what I want to, want to, want to
