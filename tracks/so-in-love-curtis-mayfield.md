So in love
You do so many things with a smilin' face
So in love
Every time we kiss, it's such a pleasant taste
That's why I know this feelin' good and strong
Tryin' I was, was here to get along
I want to testify, you mean so much to me
Let me write the fact, I mean it honestly


Life is strange, believe me it is true
We don't always mean the things we sometimes do
Look at me, look at you
You know we're so in love


Baby, don't ask why
You're movin' my emotions
So in love


You don't have to worry
You have my devotion
This love affair is bigger than we two
Lose the faith and it will swallow you
Loving you is what I'll always feel
Never ever doin' things against our will
Nothing is, nothing required, any kind of cares


You being you and I being me
You don't worry 'bout the rest
And our love is our confession
That we're so in love

So in love
I try to do the best that a man can do
So in love
The key to our success to see each other through
So in love (So in love)
Baby, don't ask why
You're movin' my emotions (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
