Aww nigga do you know what this is
One shot one kill whats the deal G-UNIT! (here we go now!)
Aww nigga do you know who you with
It's tony yayo up in this bitch
Got them German lugers with them hollow tips
See shot lugers with an extra clip


50 cent back on that gangsta shit
On my way ot to flip them bricks
In that big body benz you know its oh 6
Got your bitch on my dick I stack them chips
And a flash as a fuck my jewels so sick
From a block away you can see them kid
Dont front mothafucka you know my style
I don't go nowhere without my 40 cal
I'm on the low shorty gotta thing for the kid
And you know I'm feelin to take her back to the crib
Here we go imma show her how a playa live
At the door I tell her to take her clothes off...shit


Shorty so seductive dancin on me
Its the way that she move that makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again
 - shorty so seductive dancin on me
The way that she move makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again


I put the g in g-unit baby I got game
Head to go good to go and I don't know your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car meals on the shock bar
Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
You goin to the telly and you gettin popped off
I can't stop thinkin of the things you do
When your freakin me and I'm freakin you
I said the ice on my neck make the shortys stare
Baby let me fly you in my lair
Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby
Its past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club don't call my p.o.


Shorty so seductive dancin on me
Its the way that she move that makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again
 - shorty so seductive dancin on me
The way that she move is makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again


My ways be spinnin I charm the amazing women
You know them black and them white and the asian women
Lets cut the small talk you know why I approach you
I can't stand when a dime act anti-social
Gucci, lip gloss, Louis Vuitton, and the boots from batego vanetto cost a arm
Yayos a don my car european
You got mirrors in your pants cause I can see me in um
Listen I piss out cris inhale haze
I'm in the marriot gettin laid all day
Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black ass cum
I need groupie love the coupe on dubs
I'm in this club with a tre pound star
Dont blame it on david I'm all iced out
Cause 50 got me rich so the bar all priced out


Shorty so seductive dancin on me
Its the way that she move that makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again
 - shorty so seductive dancin on me
The way that she move is makin me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again
