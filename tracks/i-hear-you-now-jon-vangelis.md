After the first embrace from you
My senses knew the look of love was in your eyes
And after we first make love
Our senses tingle to the touch oh how we hypnotize
Oh, to get the feeling on and on
Oh, just to get the feeling

Holding you closer in my arms
We drift to heaven bringing in the morning light
And after all is said and done
There's only us we can make it right
So, our love will carry on and on
Now, our love will be free, be free

And when we play, love don't delay, I hear you now
For what was then, is what is now, anyhow

As I became a guest of love's tune, hear again
We'll carry on together like today

After the first embrace from you I
After the first embrace from you I want you too
