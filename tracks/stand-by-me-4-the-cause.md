If the sky (if the sky that we look upon)
That we look upon (sky that we look upon should tumble and fall)
Should tumble and fall

Or the mountain (or the mountain)
Should crumble (or the mountain)
To the sea ( or the mountains should crumble to the sea)

I won't cry (no I won't cry)

No I (no I won't shed a tear) won't shed a tear
