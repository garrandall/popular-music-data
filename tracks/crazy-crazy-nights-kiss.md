Woh!
Here's a little song for everybody out there!

People try to take my soul away
But I don't hear the rap that they all say

They try to tell us we don't belong
That's all right, we're millions strong
This is my music, it makes me proud
These are my people and this is my crowd

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!

Sometimes days are so hard to survive, oh yeah
A million ways to bury you alive

Hey, the sun goes down like a bad, bad dream
You're wound up tight, gotta let off steam
They say they can break you again and again
If life is a radio, turn up to ten

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!

Oh, these are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
Come on! These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!

Yeah! Woh!

And they try to tell us that we don't belong
But that's alright, we're millions strong
You are my people, you are my crowd
This is our music, we love it loud

Yeah, and nobody's gonna change me
'Cause that's who I am, uh!

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! Yeah!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! O yeah!

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! Oh yeah!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! Hey!

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! Yeah
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights! Come on!

These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
