Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max


Call me OG with the young flow
Allen Iverson, no practice
That's KD on the winning team
Got my wrist game on all axis's
That's big dream since the Dream Team
Now I'm on one like March Madness
Flow hot, make the climate change
Melt them polar caps causing raging weathers
I'm young enough to like slip and slide in my backyard but I never slip
Wordsmen since day one
Write a verse like the screen play
Michael Bates spitting A-1 for the sonic youth like I'm Green Day
In the field like Green Bay
Catching plays, it's a field day
My grind game, my mind state
Well seasoned that's Garry V
Rap game got it locked down but I never asked it to marry me
And I'm cooking verses so legendary
This garlic parmesan, lemon pepper
This Wing Stop call it chicken dinner
This that well done and you can tell the difference
Ok, I know


Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max


It's Marty baby
I don't care who your boss is
I run through the office, run through the offense
I don't got a off switch, I'm a awesomeness
Every beat like a country cartridge
Awkward with a little bit of ah
Pull up to a hitter like ah
Seriously, this is like the fourth song I've interrupted
If you don't like our music you're dead inside
Saw a fight like celebrity death match
Battle any rapper who have negative feedback
Batman, yeah, run with a ski mask
Been in the hood, that's a G pass
I don't look back, I don't recap
You say the best, I don't see that
I lost some friends that I need back
I pray so hard I need knee pads
I'm Larry David to the haters
On the way to be your favorite
On the way to see the Lakers
Never got robbed by the majors
You said got robbed by the neighbors
I really want to make this clear
Yeah, every year is our year
Swear it's not even fair


Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max
