Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry, like sorry


Forgive me
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive, me forgive me


But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine


I love you
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you, I love you


But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time, you'd be mine
You'd be mine
You'd be mine
