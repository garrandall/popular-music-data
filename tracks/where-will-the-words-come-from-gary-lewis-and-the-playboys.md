Where will the words come from
When I tell you I don't love you anymore?
When I command my lips to say
"It's over now, please go away"
Will the words be there
Or will they fail me like they've always done before?
Where will the words come
When I tell you I don't want you, I don't love you anymore

What happened to the love we had when it went away?
Did it change itself into a cloud & become a rainy day?
Where will the words come
When I tell you I don't want you, I don't love you anymore

Where will the words come from
When I tell you I don't love you anymore?
When I search inside my soul
For words to tell of love grown cold
Will the words be there
Or will they fail me like they've always done before?
Where will the words come
When I tell you I don't want you, I don't love you anymore
