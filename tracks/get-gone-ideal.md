Hey, come in here for a minute
Sit down
Come here, cause we gotta talk, Okay
Well, you just stay here for a little bit tonight
Man, I don't even know where to start
Yo, I want you try to understand somethin', okay?
Now, just listen


In the beginning, you know I tried
To make it work for you and I
Seems like I was always by myself
Like you didn't ever, ever wanna help
The strain you put on me, you let me down
Can you tell me why, after all I've done?
For you and us
You know I really hate to say it, but I gotta tell you som'


I think I better leave (leave) you alone (alone)
So get your bags (yeah) and get the hell on (on)
See, because I don't want you no more
(I don't want you no more)
I think you better leave (leave) me alone (alone)
So get your bags (yeah), get the hell on (get gone)
Because love ain't here no more


I don't know if it hurts
To hear me say all of these words
But then again, I guess by now
I really don't care
(See I've waited much too long)
Always thought that it could work
Thought it could be, forever you and me
Tell me, what happened to us?
Wait a minute, don't speak
Right now all I wanna do is see you leavin'


(Leave) me alone (alone)
Get your bags (yeah), get the hell on (on on)
Cause I don't want you no more
Said I think I better leave (leave) you alone (alone)
Get your bags (yeah), get the hell on (get gone)
Cause love ain't here no more


See, I tried to do it right
Tried to make you see the light
All that I wanted, all that I needed, was you in my life
Havin' broke down and for what?
Changed so many times, forgot who the real me was
But it's alright, I said it's cool
Cause I'm getting rid of you


I think it's time to leave (leave) me alone (alone)
Get your bags (yeah), get the fuck on (on on)
Because love don't want you no more
Said I think it's time to leave (leave) me alone (alone)
Get to steppin' (yeah), get the hell on (get gone)
Love (love) ain't (ain't) here (here) no more (no more)

Oh leave (leave) me alone (alone)
Get your bags (yeah), leave the keys on the table (on on)
Cause I don't want you no more
(See I've waited much too long)
Said I think you better leave (leave) me alone (alone)
Get to steppin' (yeah), get gone (get gone)
Cause love ain't here no more

(Fades)
You better get on (get on), get on (get on)
Get on (get on), you ain't takin' a thing (get on)
Just get on (get on), get on
Get on (get on), leave the credit cards with me
