Yeah, another Soul on Soul Production
Yeah, I stay soaked in foreign colognes
I keep that Goochie sweaters, hand knit cuz that's that blush shit
I stay in lace because my body got massage taste
Rolex on my cuff flooded with diamonds and stuff
A half a dozen hundred Benz, cool in my driveway
Tried to have it my way the fly way
That's you were baby
I should of kept it real when I was with you
Instead I dissed you
So now I miss, true


It's been too long since you've been gone
Feels good when I'm with you
I miss you, come back home
I need your smile
Ain't seen you in a while
I'm so alone
I miss you, come back home


It's been two sleepless nights three lonely days
Since I last saw you
Now things just ain't the same
Whatever happened to the promise that we made
You'll never leave me, I'll never leave you
Now you're gone

I've got so many things to say
Can we talk about it, I want to talk about it
But let's not talk about who's right or who's wrong
I want to move on so we can start all over again
'Cause I'd much rather be with you than without you
I love you, baby I need you
So sugar, come back home
I'm so all alone
I need someone that I can talk to
I miss you

Hey yo, it's the Chocolate Mac
The slim kid with gold front
Eyes red from blunt
(that's) been on tour for months
They dipped, they crushed women
Play it from the beginning
Creaming women
And I be sinning
That's how I'm living
Ladies in all complexions, connections, in ghetto sections
But you'll be that exception
The one I cared about
Wanna know about your whereabouts
And then I dissed you
So now I miss you, true

So sugar come back home
I'm so all alone
I need someone that I can talk to
I miss you
