I can take a tear and make it disappear with a wave of my hand
And If your heart is broken apart I can put it together again
And if you sink into misery, you can always count on me,
Mr Magic, Magic, Magic Man, I'll understand, woah I'll understand

I can take a frown and turn it upside down and make it a smile
And don't you know I can turn it around and ease the pain a while
When I appear in a puff o' smoke, all your troubles will become a joke
Mr Magic, Magic, Magic Man, whoo I'll understand, woah I'll understand

Ala kazip kazam, Ala kazip kazam
Sho'nuff got you down, I spread my spells around

I can take a dream and make it really seem like a dream come true, whoa Lord
And all of my tricks I pull out of my hat I can rearrange for you
I'll be your genie forever, rub me 3 times I'll get together
Mr Magic, Magic, Magic Man, woah I'll understand, woah I'll understand

Ala kazip kazam, Ala kazip kazam,
Sho'nuff got you down, I spread my spells around

All night long all night long
Aaall night long all night long
Aaall night long, all night long
Aaall night long all night long...
