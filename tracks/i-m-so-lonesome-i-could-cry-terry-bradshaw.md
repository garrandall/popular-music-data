Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome
I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide it's face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome
I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome
I could cry
