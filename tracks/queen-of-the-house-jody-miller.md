Up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
I got old floors to wax and scrub and there's a dirty old ring in the tub
I'll get a maid someday but till then I'm queen of the house
No time to fix my hair need a new dress to wear
Old clothes will have to do cause the kids all need new shoes
I got bridge club each Tuesday night he goes out with the boys and gets tight
But when the evenin's through he comes a home to the queen of the house
I know the milkman the iceman they come every day
They give me tips on the horses to play
And when I got the time to spare I sit and wish that I'd picked a rich millionare
I sing up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
Oh by Syndays I'm mighty glad we send the kids to his Mom and Dad
It's the day that makes me glad I'm queen of the house
Up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
Oh by Syndays I'm mighty glad...
