(Jon)
Do you feel it
When we touch
Do you feel the beating
In your heart

Do you hear it
When we kiss
Do you feel the throbbing
Echo start

(Robin)
Yes I can feel it
When we touch
I can feel the throbbing
In my Soul

I can hear it
When we kiss
A beating
There's no control

(Both)
Do you hear the sound
Of something pounding
In your mind
Must be love
Must be love
Must be love

Like a thousand drums
Saying I want you
Drums, saying I need you
Drums, saying I love you
And all that I am
Belongs to you

(Jon)
From the first time
You were close to me
I knew our love
Was supposed to be

(Robin)
I just can not
Fight my destiny
So with love
I give the rest of me

(Both)
Like a thousand drums
Saying I want you
Drums, saying I need you
Drums, saying I love you

(Jon)
And all that I am
Belongs to you

(Robin)
And all that I am
Belongs to you

(Repeat chorus
2 times to fade)
