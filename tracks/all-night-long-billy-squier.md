I get up--I run through the world like a fire
Heat it up--I swim in the flames of desire
Chase it if you care--take it if you dare--it's there in the air...
Answer to the gun--dance in the sun--run boy run...
Run for your life--you're movin' on and on
The art of survival is turnin' me on

And I'll be chasin' it all night long (don'tcha wanna live)

I get out--I roam through the streets like a tiger
Let it out--I swing like a bird on a wire
Everywhere you go everybody knows--oh don'tcha know...
Everythin' you do--anybody new--they're all on to you...
Fight for your life--turn it all around 
The art of survival isn't gettin' me down

And I'll be chasin' it all night long (don'tcha wanna live)
