I'm stompin'
Let's start a moshpit
Fuck a protest let's start a moshpit
Yeah


Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating cod fish in here (Eating cod fish in here)
New space coupe feel like a martian in here (Skeert)
Fuck a protest lets start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)


Out of space hot like a martian in here
Doing donuts in the lot ain't no parking in here
We about that action ain't no talking in here
Shorty twerking on the walls, Peter Parker in here
Haters in the rear view, ex on my phone
We too loud I can't hear you
His blood turn his coat red, I will Paul Revere you
I'ma ball 'til I fall, I will Cavalier you
Space Jam jumping they asking who let the monsters in here
I'm with killers I'm with straight Jeffrey Dahmer's in here
I hang with animals, lil' brody brought the llama in here
Money old, old enough to fuck your mama in here, oh yeah


Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating cod fish in here (Eating cod fish in here)
New space coupe feel like a martian in here (Skeert)
Fuck a protest lets start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)


Fuck a protest let's start a fight in here
I just stepped up in the party all my snipers here
I be rocking Tom Ford popping Molly though
Now I'm eating calamari no more sloppy joe
Choke sandwich in my mansion, tryna save for dinner
I'ma start a moshpit in the Staples Center
All you niggas bitter, it's alright though
Codeine in my liver, I'm sipping hydro
I'm blowing nitro, smoking jetpack
Hating on a street nigga, can't respect that
I wanna jump out in a crowd, but I be scared to do it
Cause if they pull on me the wrong way, I'ma go to shooting

Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating codfish in here
New space coupe feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest let's start a moshpit
Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here
No oatmeal and grits I'm eating cod fish in here (Ayy)
New space coupe feel like a martian in here
Fuck a protest lets start a moshpit
