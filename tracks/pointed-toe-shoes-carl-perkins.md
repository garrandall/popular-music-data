Well there's a
Brand new style going round
A hypnotizing cats in town
Living in a walking dream
A pointed toe and that's what I mean

I said pointed toes
Are coming back again
Uh huh uh, pointed toes
Are coming back again

Well, everything's alreet
When I got 'em on my feet
I say the point's coming back again

Well, they're made from high colored dye
Long and lean, narrow and keen
Some are brown, some are black
A cat starts a walking
He's easy to track

I said pointed toes
Are coming back again
Uh huh uh, pointed toes
Are coming back again

Everything's alreet
I got 'em on my feet
I say the point's coming back again
Rock

Well, I'm sharp toed
A high heeled
And buckle on the side
Zip 'em up and lace 'em up
Or any old style

I won't have to worry
Who's stepping on my blues
A keen cutting cat
In my pointed toe shoes

I said the pointed toes
Are coming back again
Uh huh, pointed toes
Are coming back again

Everything's alreet
I got 'em on my feet
I said the point's coming back again
Rock

Sharp toes, I want a pointed shoe
Uh huh, sharp toes, I want a pointed shoe
Ooh, yeah, yeah, I want a pointed shoe
Uh huh, sharp toes, I want a pointed shoe

Well, everything's alreet
I got 'em on my feet
I said the point's coming back again
