Yeah


I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been bored for a long, long time
You need love and so do I
Let's turn it all around
I don't want an everlasting thing
I don't care if I see you again
So grab your coat and honey tell your friends
You won't be home
You won't be home
You won't be home


Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to
Just don't hurt me, baby


Yeah


I don't really want to challenge you
Marry you or remember you
I just wanna make love to you
For 24 hours or more
Or more
I'm only looking for a fantasy
An interlude from reality
Don't want nobody tryin' to rescue me
So rock me babe
Rock me babe
Rock me, rock me


Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to
I want you to


And tomorrow morning we won't cry
You go your way, honey, I'll go mine
I'm the one who didn't waste your time
Remember me this way
And if you never see my face again
Think of me as a permanent friend
The one who loved you like a hurricane
Then disappeared
Disappeared
Disappeared


Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me


Tonight you're mine
Tonight you're mine
Do anything
Do anything
Tonight you're mine
Tonight you're mine
Tonight, always tonight you're mine
Do anything that you
Do anything that you
Do anything that you want me to
You want me to, you want me to
You want me, want me , want me
Just do anything
Anything your heart desires, babe
