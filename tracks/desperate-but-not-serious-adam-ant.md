If I ask you difficult questions
If I make improper suggestions
Would you find that a risk to your health?
Would you put me up on the bookshelf?
With the books 
And the plants

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious

If I were kind and adoring
How would that be? Very boring
Mister Pressman, with your penknife
Always asking about my sex life
And who with 
And how many times

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious

All the advice seems so unkind
If you don't stop, you will go blind
They tell you it's none of their business
And console you with a big kiss
On the lips 
And on the back of your neck

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
