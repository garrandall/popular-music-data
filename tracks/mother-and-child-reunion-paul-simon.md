No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, oh, little darling of mine.
I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
It just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

But I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, oh, little darling of mine.

I just cant believe it's so,
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
Such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

But I would not give you false hope (no)
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away, yeah

But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away

Only a moment away

Yeah
Oh yeah
