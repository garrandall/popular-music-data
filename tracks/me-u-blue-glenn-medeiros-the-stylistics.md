With all my heart
I pledged my love forever
You've got my word
You and I will always be together

There may be times we have a disagreement
This love`s too strong
To ever let it come between us

I will keep this love alive
I will
Because otherwise


Me minus you equals blue
Can't imagine what I'd ever do
If it ever came to
Me minus you equals blue


I can`t stand the thought of us apart
Like so many hearts
Beating in the dark
It'll never be me minus you

Each day I learn
A little more about you
And I know for sure that
I never want to be without you

We're gonna stay so true to this relation
Me without your loving
Is such a sad equation, baby

I will keep this love alive, baby
I will
Because otherwise




I can't stand the thought of us apart
Like so many hearts
Beating in the dark
It`ll never be

What we got can`t get much better
I will never change your thing
Baby, we're so good together
That I never, never, ever
Want it to be me



I can't stand the thought of us apart
Like so many hearts
Beating in the dark
It`ll never be me minus you
