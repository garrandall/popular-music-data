Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah)

Yeah I admit that I'm at fault
But no, you've done it too
You gotta open up your eyes
Why can't you see it from my point of view, I want you to
Why do we tell each other lies?
I thought you knew it when I said
That I would call last night
I couldn't find myself a phone
Now come to think about it
Can you tell me, am I right?
How do I know you were alone?

(These boots are made for walking)
(That's just what they'll do)
(One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)

(Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah)

Don't try to tell me I'm the one who's making our mistakes
And that I'm causing all the pain
I told you once before you gotta learn some give and take
Or was my talking all in vain

Oh there may come a day when I can give my soul about
Right now I need my space and time
I'll give you everything one day you know I will somehow
I'm gonna hold on to my pride

(These boots are made for walking)
(That's just what they'll do)
(One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)

I see you want me to walk
You see there's no room for talk
Standing out in the cold
You got me feinin' and gawking
A fool is what I'm feeling
But see baby that's fine
I bought some blue suede shoes this time
To do some stepping
And do some stomping
Hanging out with the guys and the girls, do some romping
Dance and play and shout and everything's cool
You put a boot in your mouth fool

(These boots are made for walking)
(That's just what they'll do)
(One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)

(Are you ready boots?)
(Start walking)
