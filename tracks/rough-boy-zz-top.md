What the hell wrong with me?
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Got no bed, ain't got no time
If you give me just a minute then I'll feel so fine

I am the one who can take your heat
I'm the one you'll never beat
I'll give it to you straight, I'll look you in the eye
If you give me just a minute then I'll show you why

I'm a rough boy
Oh, I'm a rough boy
I'll give it to you straight or look you in the eye
If you give me just a minute, girl, I'll show you why

I don't care what you think of me
'Cause I'm the one who gonna set you free
I'll give it to you straight or look you in the eye
Oh, take a fuckin' minute and I'll show you why

I'm a rough boy
I'm a rough boy
And I'll shoot it to you straight, I'll look you in the eye
If you give me just a minute, girl, I'll tell you why

I'm a rough boy
I'm a rough boy
I'll give it to you straight, I'll tell you no lie
If you give me just a minute, girl, I'll show you why

I'm a rough boy
I'm a rough boy
Oh, give it to you straight, I'll tell you no lie
If you give me just a minute, girl, I'll show you fuckin' why

I'm a rough boy
I'm a rough boy
Oh, I'll give it to you straight, I'll give it to you right
If you give me just a minute, girl, I'll show you why
