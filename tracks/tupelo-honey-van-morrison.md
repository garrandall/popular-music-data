You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around all the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea


She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee


You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor bent on chivalry


She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (she's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee


You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor intent on chivalry


She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (she's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee


Oh, you know she's alright
You know she's alright with me (she's an angel)
Oh, you know, you know, you know she's alright
She's alright with me (she's an angel)
Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know she's alright
Right with me (she's an angel)
She's alright, yeah, she's alright, she's alright with me (she's an angel)
She's alright, she's alright to me (she's an angel)
She's alright, she's alright (she's an angel)
She's al- she's alright, she's alright, she's alright (she's an angel)
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright, she's alright (she's an angel)


You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail it right around all the seven oceans
Drop it smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea, because


She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (she's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee (she's an angel)
Oh, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (she's an angel)
Oh, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like the real thing, oh, from the bee
Yeah, don't you know that


Oh she's alright, she's alright with me (she's an angel)
She's my babe, yeah, don't you know right (she's an angel)
She's my baby babe, she's my babe, yeah don't you know right (she's an angel
She's my baby oh, she's all  (she's an angel)
 (she's an angel)
