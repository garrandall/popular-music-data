Oh, no (oh, no, I don't like it like that)
Oh, no (oh, no, I don't like it like that)
No, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, no, I don't like it like that)
I been to the place and it ain't like that



I been to the place across the track
That place called I like it like that
I've been with Tony, I've been with Lou
I'm here to tell you that place won't do



Well, I was down there when you lost a shoe
That's when some cat was yelling at you
Things got so bad, I couldn't stand no more
I made the scene and ran out the door
