You had your fill,
And now you're on your way.
Searchin' for what,
Nobody knows.

You think you can go,
Just anywhere.
And toy with any willin' soul.

You play with love,
As though it's a game.
Leavin' a string of broken hearts,
Heart beats stoppin', oh, oh. (?)

But soon the day,
Will come and you'll learn,
The love that you waste,
You're gonna need it,
Again and again and again.

(You're throwing a good love away)

Oh baby,
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,

You led me to believe.
Walking together,
Down the aisle.

And now you're telling me,
It's all a big mistake.
I'm not the apple
Of your eye.

Baby,
You play with love,
As though it's a game.
Leavin' a string of broken hearts...
Now we're down the road,
But, don't wanna love me...

But soon the day,
Will come and you'll learn,
The love that you waste,
You're gonna need it,
Again and again and again.

(You're throwing a good love away)

Oh baby,
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

I'm a good man.
You don't know it now,
But you'll know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

You play with love,
As though it's a game.
Leaving a string of broken hearts...
Uh huh, mmm huh.

But soon the day,
Will come and then you'll learn,
The love that you waste,
You're gonna need it,
Again and again and again.

(You're throwing a good love away)

Woah,
You don't know it now,
But you'll know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

Baby,
You don't know it now,
Don't ya know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

I know...
I'm gonna miss ya woman.
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
Till your well runs dry,
Girl, you're gonna cry, one day.

Ahhh baby,
(You don't know it now)
You know life is funny sometimes,
(But you'll know it someday)
The same one that said 'I love you, '
Can refuse ya,
Try to use you, sometime.

I gotta know,
Will you stick with me, baby?
Woah,
Hey, I know that you're a young girl.
Freedom's new to your world,
But honey, you're throwing a good man down the drain...
A good man away... hey!

You don't know it, baby.
(You're throwing a love man away)
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)

(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
(You're throwing a good love away)

Yes, yes you are!
Yes you are!
Yes you are, baby!

You're throwin' my love away!
Save it for a rainy day.
Ahhh,
I wonder...
I wonder...
If I showed you the way,
Would you love me today,
Somewhere in your future?

Ahhhh baby,
Ahh, yOu don't' know,
YOu don't' know,
YOu don't' know,
No no no no no no, no.

I'm a good man.
I love you you, ahh ahh ahh.

Woah, I'm a good man,
Ask your friends.
You? see me when,
Walkin' around?

Well I love you,
And I'll settle down.
Hey,
Ah, somewhere in the future,

Hey! Hey! Ey!
Yes you are!
Yes you are!
Yes you are!

Throwing our love away!
Don't want me around,
I've been a good man,
A good good good good man.

I'll love ya,
Woah oh oh oh!
Baby, I'm your lover.
Nobody'll

Oh baby,
I pray for you night and day.
Don't ever go away.

You're a young girl,
And I my
And I know what I gotta do.

I-I-I love ya,
Ah...




(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
