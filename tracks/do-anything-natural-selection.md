Other than my narcissism the only reason I'm alone is because I am fatter than everyone around me
Or at least that's what I choose to believe
Painted my flesh to look like something different
I do not think I had authority, I just wished you'd listen to me
And you did
But then you changed what you saw in me, deciding to fit me into a box labeled "Everybody"

You tried to paint me out as a wolf in sheep skin
But deep down I was just the sheep in the lion's den
And through natural selection the grace of our  may be just by overwhelming familiarity to rejection
Someone silenced the mouths of those lions

This pit hole once found filled with bad stomach fling
Just aimless trying to getting by but fear holds no angle
No attachment to false idols or deities built below the clouds
I was silent but screaming so loud
Woke but not proud
A resonating sound
An unforgettable sound
A sound that will move this whole gen around
And darling, you know they say actions speak louder than words
If this is true, we will not rest until this whole world is dead

Hand in hand
Free me so I can free you
Release the hounds so I can release the balloons
A parade so grand no one can stand to ignore our sound
What seemed like doubt was just false and it's continued to future proms
When the past became fiction and screwed by poor diction
More about the skin and less about the sheep within

Darling, let's not rush but hear the words I speak
You said you finally had the strength to walk away from our love but you were just too weak
Too weak to seek when the world said you didn't need to worry about financial stability
And here in this pit and the pit of my tomach surrounded by lions, I can't silence them
Can your God do this?
The God that gave you that education?

This is not about finding the words to change the pain
This is about action
Darling, I'm gonna ask you once more: Do you have anything in your heart left fighting for?
If so, God will provide the means if you can supply the passion
This is not about finding the words
It's about action
Darling, I'm gonna ask you once more: Do you have anything in your heart left fighting for?
If so, God will provide the means if you can supply the passion
So bring out that passion
