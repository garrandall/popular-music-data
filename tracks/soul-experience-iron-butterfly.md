Be yourself and live a little
Don't bother painting your face
Tomorrow it may rain and colors run
Better it quench the flowers thirst

Don't be afraid to live a little
Don't be afraid of the people that belittle our love
Oh our love

Open up your thoughts and listen to others
Your fellow man may surprise you
He offers a unique item

Soul experience, help yourselves to each other

Don't be afraid to live a little
Don't be afraid of the people that belittle our love
Oh our love

Just be yourself

Just be yourself

Oh our love, oh our love
