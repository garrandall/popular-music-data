One more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carryin' such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back
One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it

One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down
Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it
No no no baby

Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode
Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to burst

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it
No, honey, not another
