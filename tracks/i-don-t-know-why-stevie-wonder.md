I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you


Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule
I don't know why I love you
But I love you ooooooh
Oh you never stop your
Cheating ways with another guy
You laugh in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced
Because I love you
Oh baby, baby, baby
I don't know why I love you
I don't know
You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby
But I love you baby
Oh darling, darling, darling
You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on
This cold black earth, baby
No I never, I never knew
How much love could hurt
Until I loved you baby
Till I loved you baby, baby


Oh baby, I can't stop
I can't stop crying can't you see
Here I'm pleading on my knees
I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please
Because I love you, I love you baby, whoahhh

Sure enough, baby, yeah
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know none of us
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know baby, I don't know aaaahhhh
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know
You don't know nothing about it
Nobody can do nothing about it
