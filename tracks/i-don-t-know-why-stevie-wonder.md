I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down, that's your rule
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

Oh, you never stop your
Cheatin' ways with another guy
You laugh in my face
Just how long can I be disgraced
'Cause I love you

I don't know why I love you
I don't know
You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby
But I love you baby
Oh baby, baby, baby

You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on
This cold black earth
No I never, I never knew
How much love could hurt
Until I loved you baby
Baby, baby, baby

I don't know, I don't know
Something about you and me, baby
Baby, I don't know why I Love you
Sometimes you make me feel so good
