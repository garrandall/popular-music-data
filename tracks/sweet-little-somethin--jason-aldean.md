Just what I had in mind
Thinkin' about the weekend
Standin' by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good, goin' around
There's just one thing missin', baby, right about now

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standin' there red hot, tied up little tank top
Lookin' like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I see you dancin' over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showin' off that sun tan
You keep smilin' that smile at me
Like you're readin' my mind, and you know

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standin' there red hot, tied up little tank top
Lookiin' like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I need a sweet little somethin' like you, girl,
Slidin' into my world
Yeah, I've been needin' it all night
Slow kinda just right,
Honey suckle sweet little somethin'

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standin' there red hot, tied up little tank top
Lookin' like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin'

Sweet little somethin' like you got
Standin' there red hot, tied up little tank top
Lookin' like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat
Lookin' so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like

I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you

The way you slide that across the seat
Lookin' so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like you
