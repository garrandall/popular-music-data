That's true (Uzi), that's right (That's right, that's right)
She sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it get her wetter (Her wetter)
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder (They is redder)
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar ('Bout my cheddar)
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together (Be together)
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header (My header)
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her (Gotta dead her)
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her (Met her) (Hello...?)


Now you beggin' this a doozy
But beggars cannot be choosy
Been the queen for eight summers
Just tell them to call me Suzy
This that Nicki, this that Uzi
This Hennessy got me woozy
Broke the Internet in 5411's and some Gucci
The blue ribbons eatin' sushi
It's that real good coochie
This that wet as Chattahoochee
Fuck all y'all like a hoochie
Givin' them bars since a teen
I ain't goin' back to juvie
I am Nicki Yamaguchi
'Cause I skate with the ice
I don't say what's the price
Lookin' like it's a heist
I been winnin' all my life
On a roll, it's a dice
Since that Itty Bitty Piggy
Rep my city like committees
If you fucked it up with Nicki
You feel pretty fuckin' shitty, uh
Anyway, I'm stoppin' bags like the TSA
Listen up you little bitches, it's a PSA
I'm still shadin' all these niggas, yeah the DITA way
You gotta pay me flat bread, yeah the pita way


(Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I know you're sad and tired (Yeah)
You've got nothin' left to give (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live (Yeah)
I know that you'll get over it (Yeah)


Wish I never ever ever told you things (Told you things)
I was only, only tryna show you things (Show you things)
Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring (Froze your ring)
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain (Hold the pain)
We was in Hawaii lookin' at the ring (Yeah)
(You'll get over it)
She smilin' happy, but I'm laughin' 'cause her man's a lame
(You'll get over it)
(Broke boy, broke boy, broke boy, broke boy)
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (You'll get over it)
(Real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
(You'll get over it)
(Yeah)


I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothin' left to give (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live (Ay)
I know that you'll get over it


See I tied up my Raf, you strapped up your Rick (Woo)
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist (Wrist)
Complement my style (Style)
She don't want me, I'm runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
You know I respect her on that level (On that level)
She don't want me, then I'ma let her (I'ma let her)
Go over there with that broke fella (Broke fella)
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather (That leather)
My new chick, I swear that she better (Want me back never)
Want me back, never (Oh)


That's true, that's right (That's right, that's right)
She's sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it get her wetter (We-etter)
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder (Redder)
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar (Cheddar)
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together (Together)
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header (Header)
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her (Dead her)
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her (Met her)


I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (Woah, what what)
You'll find another life to live (You'll find)
I know that you'll get over it (You'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (No, no)
You'll find another life to live (You will)
I know that you'll get over it (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)


(You'll get over it)
(I know that you'll get over it)
I know it's over
Check out my cold shoulder  (Nothin' left to give)
I know it's over
Cry on that hoe shoulder (You'll get over it)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm


We-e used to be-e
Kissin' in the tree-e
'Member it was just you and me-e
(you'll get over it)
Kissin' in the tree-e
'Member it was you was just you and me-e
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
K-i-s-s-i-n-g-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

Uh
(You'll get over it)
