If I had a wish baby I wish he never left you feeling like this
Cause I can feel your pain
But if you just could get over him
Maybe some wine will empty your mind
Girl I'm a make it better
Now can we dim the lights let's make a toast
That it will be alright


Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian man
Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian angel


I know we can win and you can depend on me
Through the thick and thin to the very end
I got your back, so open your heart and let me come on in
And I'll be your king
(And you'll be the queen of my heart, and my soul, and everything I treasure)
So let me ease your mind, and let's make a toast
That it'll be alright


Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian man
Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian angel
Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian man
Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian angel
