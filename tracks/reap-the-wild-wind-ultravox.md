Reap the wild wind
Reap the wild wind

Reap the wild wind
Reap the wild wind

A finger points to show a scene (take my hand, take my hand)
Another face where mine had been (take my hand, take my hand)
Another footstep where I once walked (take my hand)
Take it all

You take my hand and give me your friendship
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply
Give me an inch, and I'll make the best of it
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die

Reap the wild wind

A footprint haunts an empty floor (take my hand, take my hand)
A fading coat that I once wore (take my hand, take my hand)
Oh, a desolation where I once lived

I have seen in times gone by
I have felt
A different shadow on the wall
A stranglehold on a certain feeling

You take my hand and give me your friendship
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply
Give me an inch, and I'll make the best of it
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die

Reap the wild wind
Reap the wild wind

You take my hand and give me your friendship
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply
Give me an inch, and I'll make the best of it
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die

Reap the wild wind
