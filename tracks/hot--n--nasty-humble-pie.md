Find it (Who that?)
Mercy (Who that sayin' mercy?)
So hot 'n' nasty.

Hey Joe, don't forget to shake it
While you're sleepin' on that bed
You know it really makes it
Look at me shake a leg, no.

I got my head in a cloud
I'm gonna stand up and shout
I wanna sing out loud
Oh, got to do it with the feelin'
Now you gonna hit the ceiling.

(Do you get the message?) yeah
(Do you get the message?)
(Do you get the message?)
(Do you get the message yeah?)

Hey boogaloo, I really love you
Look what you've done to my head
Take all my time, take all my money
But most of all you take all my bed.

I got my head in a cloud
I wanna sing it loud
I'm gonna stand right here and shout
You got to do it with the feelin'
Well, you gonna hit the ceiling.

(Do you get the message?) yeah
(Do you get the message?)
(Do you get the message?)
(Do you get the message yeah?).

Don't forget to shake that thing.

Do you get the feelin'? Oh yeah
Then you gonna, then you gonna hit the ceiling
Hot 'n' nasty, hot 'n' nasty
It's hot 'n' nasty, so hot 'n' nasty...
