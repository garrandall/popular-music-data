Three horses grazing out my window
Brown, black and white they stand
Rolling pastures they can wander
Free and easy is their land

Don't ever take away my freedom
Don't ever take it away
Let me treasure and keep that one part of my life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days

Is that the sound of raindrops I hear fallin'?
How I love, I love to hear that sound
It makes me think of all the people that I love
Of all the quiet moments I've found

Don't ever take away my freedom
Don't ever take it away
Let us cherish and keep that one part of our life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days

Now when I am old and thinking over the life that I've led
If there's one final wish left to me
I will pray for the children yet to be born
I will pray that they will always live free

Don't ever take away their freedom
Don't ever take it away
Let us cherish and keep that one part of our life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days

There is a time for the singing and the sunshine
There is a time for the thunder and the rain
There is a time for the changing of seasons my friend
But there's one thing that we must never change

Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
Let us treasure and keep that one part of our life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days

Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
We will cherish and keep that one part of our life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days

Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
We will cherish and keep that one part of our life
