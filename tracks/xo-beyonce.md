Flight controller is here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction


Your love is bright as ever (ever, ever, ever)
Even in the shadows (shadows, shadows, shadows)
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Before they turn the lights out (lights out, lights out, lights out)
Your heart is glowing (glowing, glowing, glowing)
And I'm crashing into you (into you, into you, into you)
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Xo you can turn my lights out


We don't have forever
Ooh, baby the daylights wasting (wasting, wasting, wasting)
You better kiss me (kiss me)
Before our time has run out
Mmmhh yeah...
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Oh, baby, take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Xo you can turn my lights out


Our love is like xo
You love me like xo
You kill me boy xo
Your love is like xo- oooaahh
You're all that I see
Gimme everything
Baby love my lights out
Baby love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Xo you can turn my lights out
