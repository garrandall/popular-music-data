(Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah)
(What condition my condition was in)

I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag, but then
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what condition my condition was in)

I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawling out as I was a-crawling in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I saw so much, I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what condition my condition was in)

Someone painted "April Fool" in big black letters on a "dead end" sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
I said, I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah)
