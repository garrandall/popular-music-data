Whoa oh yeah

When, I'm sitting home
And I'm all alone
And I don't hear no phone
I need a hot shot

When it's late at night
And I ain't feeling right
There ain't no man in sight
I need a hot shot
Hot shot, hot shot

Oh baby baby baby baby baby won't you feel it in my soul
Come on now move it
Hey I know you never never never never gonna lose control
My fire's burning, it's getting real hot
You know that I need me my shot

When I'm on the street
And I feel the beat
That drives out on my feet
I need a hot shot

When I'm with the crowd
And we're feelin' proud
And the music's loud
I need a hot shot
Hot shot, hot shot

Oh come on, come on, come on, come on
You gotta feel the kinda motion in my soul
You gotta move it
Whoo, I know you never never never gonna lose control
My fire's burning, it's getting real hot
You know that I need me my shot, whooo

I need a hot shot
Hot shot hot shot hot
I need a hot shot

Burn, I'm sitting home
And I'm all alone
And I don't hear no phone
I need a hot shot

When I'm with the crowd
And we're feelin' proud
And the music's loud
I need a hot shot
Hot shot, hot shot

Oh come on, come on, come on, come on
You gotta feel the kinda motion in my soul
You gotta move it
Whoo, I know you never never never gonna lose control
My fire's burning, it's getting real hot
You know that I need me my shot, whooo

I need a hot shot
Hot shot hot shot hot (ah)
Hot shot hot shot hot
