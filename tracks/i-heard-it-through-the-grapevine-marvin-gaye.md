Oh oh

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
Took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
When I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby
Ooh

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you loved someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
Oooh ooh ooh

People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, oh ohh
I heard it through the grapevine
I am just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

Oh ohh
I heard it through the grapevine
Baby
Honey, honey
I know
That you let me go
Ohh
I heard
You know I heard
Ohh
I heard
You know I heard it through the grapevine
Do you know I heard it?
How much longer?
How much longer would you be mine, baby?
Ohh
I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
Baby
Don't you know I heard it...
