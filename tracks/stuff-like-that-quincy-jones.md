I walked in the joint
They were lined up back to back
Anything you can name, but it ain't no shame
Ain't no stuff like that

Do it - do it
Do it - do it

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

Before my eyes
Was the promise of paradise
Is she real, can she feel
Is she a dream? If ya know what I mean
'Cause she was built out of

Stuff like that (do it - do it)
Stuff like that (do it - do it)
Stuff like that (do it - do it)
Stuff like that (do it - do it)

I knew I was captured
By the rhythm of the magic flute
Pulling and urging me
To taste the forbidden fruit
Though I felt naive
I did not want to leave
Fever was in the air
All of a sudden, I didn't care
No reason why, I just had to testify

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

Do it - do it (Stuff like that)
Do it - do it (Stuff like that)
Do it - do it (Stuff like that)
Do it - do it (Stuff like that)

I knew I was captured
By the rhythm of the magic flute
Pulling and urging me
To taste the forbidden fruit
Though I felt naive
I did not want to leave
Fever was in the air
All of a sudden, I didn't care
No reason why, I just had to testify

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

All of a sudden, I didn't care
No reason why, I just had to testify

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

Do it - do it (Stuff like that)
Do it - do it (Stuff like that)
Do it - do it
Do it - do it (Stuff like that)

Stuff like that
Stuff like that
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
