Say girl, you look a little restless
Well you ought to come with me 'cause I'm going where the fun is
Come on, don't get lazy now, just a little bit up the road, just around the bend

There's something going round inside my head
I think it's something I need, something unreal
And so I see my world is upside down
But there is nothing to fear
My vision is clear
All my roads lead nowhere
What lies at the end
Reach your destination
'Cause what you find is your love bird
It's your birth started again

So get up
Get it on
Try it again
Try it again, girl
Get up
Happiness is just round the bend... yeah

Why don't you get up?
Get it on...
