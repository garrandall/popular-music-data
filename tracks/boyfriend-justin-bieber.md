If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby, take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag, swag, swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue
I don't know about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag


I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you


If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go


Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't ever wanna fight yeah, you already know
I'mma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the w-w-world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirlwind
Swaggy


I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you


If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go


So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need girl
Spend a week with your boy I'll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man (if I was your man), I'd never leave you girl
I just want to love and treat you right


If I was your boyfriend (boyfriend), never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone (never be alone)
I can be a gentleman (gentleman), anything you want
If I was your boyfriend (boyfriend), I'd never let you go, never let you go

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ey
Yeah girl
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ey
If I was your boyfriend
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ey
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ey
If I was your boyfriend
