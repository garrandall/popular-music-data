I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams


Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried


I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain


Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried




Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams


Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried


Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
And I'm a believer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm a believer
