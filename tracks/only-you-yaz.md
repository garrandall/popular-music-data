Got it on smash
Knots

Look at that, bust down the watch
Pull up, I-, yuh, yuh
Ayy, knots
I just ran up to the- mm
Look at the watch-, ayy

Yeah, ayy, knots (huh)
I just ran up to the guap (ayy)
Look at that, bust down the watch (huh)
Pull up, i8, drop the top (okay)
Smokin' on gas, fuck the cops (whoo)
Niggas can't come for my spot (tuh)
Niggas can't come for my spot (yuh)
Niggas can't come for my spot
Hol' up, like, ayy, knots (knots)
I just ran up to the guap (guap)
Look at that, bust down the watch (huh)
Pull up, i8, drop the top (whoo)
Smokin' on gas, fuck the cops (what)
Niggas can't come for my spot (what)
Niggas can't come for my spot (huh)
Niggas can't come for my spot (yuh)

Copy the steez, but with me, boy, they not (they not)
Came up finessin', coke all in my socks (my socks)
Went from my toes, look like bricks when I walk (huh)
I'm from the bottom so jugg when I talk (whoo)
Bust it down, ooh, stop (what), your diamonds lookin' so false (huh)
Too much sauce soon as I walk (damn), beam on the knot when I walk (damn)
Fuck it, bad bitch, I tap from the back when I fuck it (when I fuck it)
She move like Tekken, my drank when she bubble (she bubble)
Tastin' my choppa, might pop at this dozen (at this)
In between good and the evil, I'm middle
Always thought, "Why was my life such a riddle?" (ayy)
Reaper protect me, you wanna come get it (ayy)
Uh, wait, break it down (break it down)
Grip on her waist when I take her down (take her down)
Smokin' on pack, straight Pacquiao (Pacquiao)
Bitch, I'm on top, what you sayin' now? (sayin' now)
If she give top she can hang around (hang around)
Pass to the gang, that's a play around (play around)
Only need Yaz just to lay it down (lay it down)
Foot on the gas, I'm not breakin' now (breakin' now)
Foot on the gas, I'm not breakin' now (breakin' now)
Only need Yaz just to lay it down (lay it down)

Nowadays I been countin' a lot (a lot)
In the club so I'm takin' a shot (takin' a shot)
I was back in the hood tryna plot (true, true)
I can't love her, I think out the box (think out the box)
In the Air Max, that's the dope runners (dope runners)
Phone ringin', got some dope comin' (dope coming)
I will never save a hoe, no (no, no)
If she bad and broke, I don't want her (I don't want her)
Jumpin' in the Hellcat, hit the lane switch
Used to dream of this shit in the basement (in the basement)
Some of my niggas fightin' them cases (thirty)
When I fuck up a check, I replace it (replace it)
And the hood sayin' I'm they favorite (hood fave)
Smoke jagged, the cookie my fragrance
She said my wrist goin' ape shit (hey)
All that hatin', you won't ever make it (you won't ever make it)
I had to boss up, put the team on a mat (team on a mat)
They doubted me, there ain't no reason for that (reason for that)
I know these niggas wanna be where I'm at (be where I'm at)
I was hittin' juggs, put the weed in the stash (yuh)
Always ballin', never needed a pass (needed a pass)
Bad hoes, gotta leave in the past (leave in the past)
Cash flow comin' in so fast (cash flow)
My bag grow and your shit don't last (bag grow)


Yeah, ayy, knots (huh)
I just ran up to the guap (ayy)
Look at that, bust down the watch (huh)
Pull up, i8, drop the top (okay)
Smokin' on gas, fuck the cops (whoo)
Niggas can't come for my spot (tuh)
Niggas can't come for my spot (yuh)
Niggas can't come for my spot
Hol' up, like, ayy, knots (knots)
