Not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking...

I can still see you standing there
Midnight wind blowin' thorough your hair, remember
Kisses sweet in the salty air
When love was forever

Turn the page and we fade to blue
The scen has changed, now I'm without you, well you just
Walked away when the act was through
And the dream was over

It was almost like a movie, the way you said goodbye
You must have spent a lot of time, rehearsing each and every line

Now there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just too sad to take
And there's not a dry eye, not a dry eye in the house

The greatest story was you and me
We had it all, we had everything, but now the -
Story's done, it's just history
The last act is over

Your every line had the sweetest sound
Your every touch turned my whole world around
But then the lights cam up and my world crashed down
End of show - It's over

It was almost like a movie, those nights we touched the stars
Time stood still for you and I, now it's sad enough to make you cry

Now there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just too sad to take
And there's not a dry eye, not a dry eye in the house

Act One: The story's just begun
Act Two: I fell in love with you
Act Three: Knew it was meant to be
Act Four: You don't love me no more...

Not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just too sad to take
And there's not a dry eye, not a dry eye in the house

Not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking...

Not a dry eye in the house
Not a dry eye in the house
Not a dry eye in the house
