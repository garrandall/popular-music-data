Mockingbird


Everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Well now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
He's going to surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing


Oh, I know I love him and I can't tell him so
That I, I, I, I love him and that's all he doesn't know, he doesn't know
If that diamond don't ring don't shine
He's gonna surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing


Oh oh oh, oh oh, everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Said now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He's going to surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing


Oh, I know that I, I love him and I can't tell him so
That I, I, I, I love him and it's all he doesn't know, he doesn't know
If that diamond don't ring don't shine
He's gonna surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing


Oh oh oh, everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Said now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He's going to surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing
Oh oh oh, I, everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Said now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring
