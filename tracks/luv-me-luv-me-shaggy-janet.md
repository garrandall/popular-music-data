Catch a groove girl, catch a groove, that's right
Lover, lover, lover, mmm, Shaggy, DJ


A who da man dat love to make you moist and wet

A who da man that love to make you moan and sweat (Uh)
A who da man dat love to make you scream out "yes", naw
(Mr. Lover)


Sugar
Sweet, succulent and fine
A twinkling eye on my darling divine
I love the way you move all the way you're designed
Your only lines are my mind, forget the corny line
Now let me hit you off with this question sign
You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine
A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine
Well, I will hit you off with this lyrical rhyme


(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)
Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', Mr. Lover, keep her rockin'
Mr Lover, keep her rockin', and sweat
(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)
Now Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', Mr. Lover, keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', and sweat


Ooh boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go (That's right)
Once I get my hands on you
(Luv me, luv me, luv me sex machine)
Ooh boy, I love you son (Mmm hmm)
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go (That's right, uh)
I hope you feel the same way too (You know dat)


Step in my caravan of love
So I can love, gonna give you hotter rubs
Dem ever wet kissies wit' dem brazen hugs
And now your sweet, silky body on my Persian rug
While we sippin' Coke from da same ol' mug
I'm readin' fortune cookies from the Chinese proverb
It had some great stuff written in it with some cool rub-a-dub
A little ol' reminisce in the hot tub, huh


(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)
Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh
(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)
(Catch a groove back girl, catch a groove)


Ooh boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go (That's right)
Once I get my hands on you
(Luv me, luv me, luv me sex machine)
Ooh boy, I love you son
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go (That's right, uh)
I hope you feel the same way too (You know dat)

Shuh
Girl, you're unique
Now let me take a whiff of that sweet physique
You're the only girl allowed to make my heart stop beatin'
Let me, ha, ha, start lickin' (?), let's kick it heartlessly
To be the lady of your color is an honor indeed
Leave a lastin' impression for weeks and weeks
I want to throw rose petals to your humble feet
Lay you gently on my sheet and sexercise you to sleep, huh



(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)
Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh
(Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover)

Anytime you model girl, an instant fire
