Just trust me ok?
Just trust me ok?
In my city there's a place
All the people hang
In my city my place
They call it lover's lane
If you plan on coming by
Better be prepared
'Cause I don't like girls hanging 'round
Acting like their scared

Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane

You will find lover's lane
Sitting on top a hill
Surrounded by lots of trees
You won't see Jack 'n Jill
My little girl tries to hang
She wants to be like me
Lonely thing has been with us
Has to have her home by three

Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane

Oh Georgio, I don't know
If my father caught us up here he'd kill us
Kill us?
Kill us?
Well don't worry about it baby, just trust me ok?
OK
Oh Georgio
Oh Georgio

Darcy
Darcy
I told you

Wouldn't you like to be here
At lover's lane
Wouldn't you like to be here
At lover's lane

Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane
Lover's Lane

Wouldn't you like to be here
At lover's lane
Wouldn't you like to be here
At lover's lane
