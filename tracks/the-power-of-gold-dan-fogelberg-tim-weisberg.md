The story is told of the
Power of gold and it's
Lure on the unsuspecting
It glitters and shines
It badgers and binds
And constantly needs protecting
Balance the cost of the soul you lost
Without dreams your life is sold
Are you under the power of gold?
The letters are calls got you
Climbing the walls
And everyone wants a payday
They beg to remind you
Of love left behind you
You know the past is a loser
The face that you're wearing is different now
That the days run hot and cold
Are you under the power of gold?
The power of gold
Ooo-oo, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooo-oo, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
You're a creature of habit
Caught like a rabbit
Scared of a fear you can't name
You're overly loyal
There's no one before ya
No man that can tell it's a game
Balance the cost of the soul you lost
Without dreams your life is sold
Tell me that you're free
Of the power of gold?
The power of gold
You're never a lonely
And why does it loom?
But there's something about
The soul that deserves you
You're never a lonely
And why does it loom?
But there's something about
The soul that deserves you
You're never a lonely
And why does it loom?
But there's something about
The soul that deserves you
