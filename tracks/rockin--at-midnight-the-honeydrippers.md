Have you heard the news?
There's good rockin' at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna hold my baby
With all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Hey, hey, there's good rockin' at midnight

Have you heard the news
There's good rockin' at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna hold my baby
With all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Hey, hey, there's good rockin' at midnight

Now, sweet Chalky Brown and sweet Lorraine
They got caught on Caledonia's land
Sioux City Sue, she told it all
Those fellas got drunk and they had a ball
Crying hey, hey
Good rockin' at midnight

Well, two times



Well, I tell y'all about now Deacon John
He got so high they had to take him home
Hear the news about Ella Brown
He stole a chicken and he ran outta town
Hey, hey, there's good rockin' at midnight

Caledonia got drunk, grinning like a pig
She fell down and she lost her wig
Charlie Brown, she laughed and she got sick
And Caledonia got mad and grabbed a brick
Crying hey, hey, there's good rockin' at midnight

Oh now let's go two times



Oh yeah, wanna tell you all about now Deacon John
He got so high they had to take him home
Here's the news about Ella Brown
He stole a lot of chickens and he ran outta town
Crying hey, hey there's good rockin' at midnight

Now, now, Caledonia got drunk and grinning like a pig
She fell down and lost her wig
Charlie Brown she laughed and she got sick
Caledonia got mad ... grabbed a brick
Crying hey, hey there's good rockin' at midnight

Uh, mmm, rock
Gonna rock, Gonna rock
Gonna rock, Gonna rock
Gonna rock, Well yeah, I'm gonna rock
Gonna rock, We gonna rock
Alright, well alright
Good rockin' at midnight
