Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy, and others, they like to grind,
I'll settle for the back of your hand somewhere on my behind.
Treat me like I'm a bad girl, even when I'm being good to you,
I don't want you to thank me, you can just spank me. Mmm.

Some guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease,
Tie my hands behind my back and, oo, I'm in ecstasy.
Don't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters,
Before I get too cranky, you better...



Like hanky panky (hanky panky),
Nothing like a good spanky (good spanky).
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.
Like hanky panky (hanky panky),
Nothing like a good spanky (good spanky).
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.

Oooo.

Please don't call a doctor, 'cause there's nothing wrong with me,
I just like things a little rough and you better not disagree.
'Cause I don't like a big softie, (no), I like someone mean and bossy,
Let me speak to you frankly, you better...



Oooo, yeah.



What about? Yeah. That's an interesting...
Oooo.
My bottom hurts just thinking about it.

(She wants you to) Treat me like I'm a bad girl,
(She needs you to) Even when I'm being good to you.
I don't want you to thank me (Don't thank her), you better...



(Hanky panky) Oh, yeah
(Good spanky) Get the picture?
(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna)

That's the way I came into this world,
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl."
He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled,
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it.
Yeah.
(Hanky panky, good spanky, don't wanna cry, I just wanna)
