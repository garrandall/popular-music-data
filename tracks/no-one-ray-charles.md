There is a reason why I stop by tonight
I just don t like the way we continue on fight
Cause I need you in my life, I need you with me darling every day
And I wish I knew the magic word to say to make the pain go away
Said we need to talk it all over tonight
It really doesn t matter who is wrong or right
Cause the thing is you need me and I need you and that it s a fact, you know
And we need to come together darling and make the feeling flow
Chorus
And I don t want no one but you
No one else will ever do
You are my sunshine
You are my life
Stay with me you re always there
I ll love you til my dying day
All of my love stays with you
Cause I love you
Oh baby I love you I love you
I can tell just by the look upon my face
You don t want to stay here
No no this is not our place
So come back with me girl to make it right
Pack your clothes and come home babe with me tonight
All I want is us to start to get along
So I wish you change your mind about our love and come back home
It is an awful feeling in my heart I have just for being alone girl
Chorus
And I don t want no one but you
No one else will ever do
You are my sunshine
You are my life
Stay with me you re always there
I ll love you until my dying day
All my love stays with you
Cause I love you
Oh baby I love you I love you
And I don t want no one but you
No one else will ever do
You are my sunshine
You are my sunshine
You are my love
You are my life
Stay with me you re always there
I ll love you until my dying day
All of my love stays with you
Cause I love you
Oh baby I love you I love you
And I don t want no one but you
No one else will ever do
You are my sunshine
You are my life
Stay with me you re always there
