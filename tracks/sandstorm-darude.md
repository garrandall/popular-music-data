I burn that shit like I'm Major Lazer
I earn that shit like major paper
I melt that beat like I'm fuckin Getter
But you know I do it fuckin better

And you know I make her fuckin wetter
Than Jauz in the water during stormy weather
Than Calvin harris with the opposing gender
Borgore's got your daughter so you better get her (getter)

She on that pole like Diplo
I got a sick hoe she like to dip low
Like Dillon Francis like to GET LOW
And like San holo I got a sick flow

I can make any beat just like Skrillex
I swear can make Justin Bieber feel it
And I can make Caked Up really wanna steal it
Then I can make Scooter Braun wanna sign a deal with it

Ah yea so what, gettin lit like we Will Sparks
And we comin up like the modern day Mozart
Yea we gettin lucky with the ladies like we're Daft Punk
This is how we party, R3hab it's a slam dunk
And we hear you / G Eazy man this shit ain't fuckin random!
Oops not a Dj but that mother fuckers handsome
Bout to be Darude and turn this beat into a sandstorm
Bout to switch it up and make this mother fucker transform

I'm on so many levels like Avicci game tight
I can make Deamau5 spell his name right
Turn up my speakers like Afrojack dude
Where are you now? when I need you jack u?

I'm all alone like I'm Marshmello
Haters try to block me like your remix Hello
Don't let me down like the Chainsmokers
Let's take a Selfie baby get in Closer

I'm a vet in this game call me Tiesto
And just like Zedd workin with the best hoes
I'm just playin let's be respectful
Under control like my man Alesso

I can make your girl sing Bird Machine
Yea Dj snake, knows what I mean
And lastly you know imma Steal The Show
Like Kygo's first hit Firestone

Ah yea so what, gettin lit like we Will Sparks
And we comin up like the modern day Mozart
Yea we gettin lucky with the ladies like we're Daft Punk
This is how we party, R3hab it's a slam dunk oh!
And we hear you / G Eazy man this shit ain't fuckin random!
Oops not a Dj but that mother fuckers handsome
Bout to be Darude and turn this beat into a sandstorm
Bout to switch it up and make this mother fucker transform
