There's a mountain, and it's mighty high
You cannot see the top, unless you fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't no where to go if you hang around


Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire, there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold


There's an ocean of despair
There are people livin' there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so whatcha tryin' to say?


Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire, there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold, no no
All that glitters ain't gold, no no


There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now that's a theory, and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go


Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold (Sold)
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told (Told)
What's the use of bein' young if you ain't gonna get old? (Old)
Even at the center of fire, there is cold (Cold)
All that glitters (glitters) ain't gold, no, no, no
No, no
All that glitters ain't gold (Hey, alright)
All that glitters
All that glitters
All that glitters
Ain't gold


Na na na na na na na (Gold)
Na na na na na na na (Gold)
Na na na na na na na (Gold)
Na na na na na na na (Gold)
Gold, gold, gold
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold (Na na na na na na na)
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold (Na na na na na na na)
All that glitters ain't gold, oh
Oh yeah

1, 2--
1, 2, 3, come on!

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
All that glitters ain't gold
Na na na na na na na
All that glitters ain't gold
Na na na na na na na
All that glitters ain't gold
