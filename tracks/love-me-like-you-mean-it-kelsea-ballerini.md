Love me, love me, love me, mmm

Oh, hey
Boy with your hat back
Mmm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way,
I'mma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of

I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby,
Do you got what it takes?

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

Oh, hey
I've had my share of losers, liars, and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well, take a step back

'Cause I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby,
Are you just crazy, or crazy over me?

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna love me, love me, love me

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

Love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it
