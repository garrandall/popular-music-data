It's the cat with his eyes closed
Stay high off the hydro
Middle finger up, fuck five-0
All we know is survival
Straight like that
We gonna make money 'til we die yo
It's the cat with his eyes closed
Stay high off the hydro
Middle finger up, fuck five-0
All we know is survival
Straight like that
We gonna make money 'til we die yo

Fuck all the notions
The process is in full motion
The first one in line when that motherfucking door open
I never had a dog but I always fucking had a weapon
As an adolescent man it was mad depressing
I felt like I was chasing life every half a second
Nigga stay quiet with your mouth don't even ask a question
 blasting y'all I'm never flashing
I keep all of my heat inside a little cabin
Yo the man is ready for 'em, I already saw 'em
You straight pussy duke, I already 
Too many keep it gangster, keep riding keep rolling
Never folding for the fact you niggas know I'm holding
I used to work on a block for the price of a dime
Now I'm nice and my price is thirteen ninety-nine
And through the mic line
I just spit me a life time
Ain't nobody life out there like mine

It's the cat with his eyes closed
Stay high off the hydro
Middle finger up, fuck five-0
All we know is survival
Straight like that
We gonna make money 'til we die yo
It's the cat with his eyes closed
Stay high off the hydro
Middle finger up, fuck five-0
All we know is survival
Straight like that
We gonna make money 'til we die yo


Big Black, right back
Got , you know that
I bruise baselines my  so what you call that
That's  rap, make you one like the rap
And I'm that black cat and I'm that wood trap
Either way you dying, and that's a cold fact
Whether physically, or lyrically
The first letter B and the K is for the king
'Cause the  imma bring when I swarm on ya
Tell your moms you're a goner
Rock the don warned you, not I got to run up on ya
Strong arms straight house son you heard
That's word to whatever
My power is absurd
Ridiculous, you can't spit with us
Nor get with us
You can't even sit with us
So nigga get the fuzz, before you get bussed
You touch down the  the fag I roughed him up
 I want my platinum cup


It's the cat with his eyes closed
Stay high off the hydro
Middle finger up, fuck five-0
All we know is survival
Straight like that
We gonna make money 'til we die yo


A-Yo African butt scratch
Spas on the track like fuck that
When Ruck rap gangsta niggas ready to bust gats
Yo what's that? Listen you better put it down
I'm from the 'Ville nigga, you know I put it down
I rap and flip on a nigga
I smack the shit out a nigga
Grab the gun cock it back clap the clip on a nigga
Never test me when I'm crazy high
Ready to run on your ride and let the eighty fly
Slugs missed you, oh shit your lady died
In the side of her ride like she Lady Di
Ain't no telling what the Ruck will say
Ruck will do, Ruck with her, Ruck with who?
Listen, that's the reason why I don't fuck with you
Running your mouth like the bitches and the sluts would do
Can't touch the crew, Ruck and Rock, Tang and G
Agallah the Don, lil D-A-P


I rock rhymes like it was crack
So when you pop it wanna make that ass come back
Me and my road dogs and my niggas on a mission
So don't fuck around or else we'll leave that ass blistered
Like GHG flowing through your blood stream
My performance and style got these niggas acting wild
360 degree, dancing with my 
You niggas please, you really can't fuck with us
I ride beats like Miami waves son
Don't be amazed how we getting paid dun


Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
