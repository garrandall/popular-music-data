Don't matter baby what you might say
Nothing will change just by running away
We can't escape that's a natural fact
Act casual but there's no turning back

You fell for me as fast as I'm falling for you
The pressure's on to make the appropriate moves
But I don't move that fast

Bring out the wine if you have to
Throw me some lines to impress me
But take your time if it's meant to last

Turn out the lights if you want to
Hold me so tight that I can't breathe
Then say goodnight if it's meant to last

You know it's better takin' it slow
We'll get acquainted and see if it grows
Money can't buy what experience brings

You know the truth is I just like having a crush
Nothing around can give me the same kind of rush
But don't you move so fast

Bring out the wine if you have to
Throw me some lines to impress me
But take your time if it's meant to last

Turn out the lights if you want to
Hold me so tight that I can't breathe
Then say goodnight if it's meant to last

Don't if feel so good together
It shouldn't be that hard
If it's gonna last forever
Don't push it too far too far too far

Bring out the wine if you have to
Throw me some lines to impress me
But take your time if it's meant to last

Turn out the lights if you want to
Hold me so tight that I can't breathe
Then say goodnight if it's meant to last
