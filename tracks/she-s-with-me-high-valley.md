When the devil's knocking at my door
When I'm broken and I'm battle worn
Down in the valley, on my knees
Yea she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

When my dreams are running out of road
And the world around me's turning cold
Anyone else would up and leave
But she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
Whoa oh, I don't know what I'd do without her
Whoa oh, she's gotta know I'm all about her

She's amazing, amazing
Ain't she amazing, amazing?

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing? (That girl, she's out of my league)
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
