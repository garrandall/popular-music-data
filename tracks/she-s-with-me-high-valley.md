With a stride that says Iâm going places
Sheâs traveling fast
And I can tell from how she sways
Sheâs overcome her past

Yeah shes walking with a passion
Moving with desire
Sheâs fights for what she wants
sheâs going up, sheâs going higher

Look into her face, determination in her eyes
She wonât give up or quit, or fall for little fashioned lies
Filled with awesome expectation
This girls a fascination
And nothing in her way
Will keep her from her destination

Cause sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
When itâs hot she keeps on moving
Through the heat, keeps on improving
Yeah sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
To be free

Every time she falls
Youâll see her right back up again
Nothing keeps her down
If you count her out, you better count again

Even with her pretty face, sheâll put you in your place
Cause she is on a mission, move aside and give her space

Fists high is the air, victorious, she overcomes
From the hills, down to the valleys, from the top down to the slums

Anywhere sheâs ever been, sheâs always there to win
And if you find her quiet, then look out sheâs turned within

Because sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
When itâs hot she keeps on moving
Through the heat, keeps on improving

Yeah sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
Through the flames, youâll see her rise
Right through the smoke, donât be surprised

Because sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
But it cannot touch or burn her
Doesnât one small bit concern her
Yeah sheâs fire walking, sheâs fire walking
To be free
