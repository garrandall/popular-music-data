Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?
My arms are missing you, my lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps coming around, he's trying to wear my resistance down


Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
He calls me on the phone, about three times a day
Now my heart's just listening to what he has to say
But this loneliness that I have within keeps reaching out to be his friend



Need your loving, need your loving



I wanna say, I'm not getting any stronger, I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard to be true, but Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you



Need your loving, need your loving
Need your loving, need your loving...
(Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back)
