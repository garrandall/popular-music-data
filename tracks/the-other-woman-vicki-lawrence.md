I'm up early every Monday morning
There's some laundry to do
I'm emptying out his pockets
While the kids go off to school
And then I see the letter
And my heart just breaks in two
It's another woman's writing
Saying “Baby, I love you”

Well 10 years of being married to him
I haven't let myself letdown
So I make a quick appointment
To do some work at the gym downtown
What a shock to finally find out
That my nicest dress don't fit
So I sit down at my mirror and I get out my makeup kit


The other woman
Is in for the fight of her life
I've loved him too much
And too long to have him taken away
Oh, that would be the day

I'm going to bury the hurt
Gonna get down to work
Roll up my sleeves and be what he needs
A lover at night
Oh, and not just a wife
You bet your life
I'm gonna keep him


Well, I read the daily papers
And we discuss the latest news
And I love him each and every night
Just the way that I used to do

Well sometimes it just takes giving
To get something back again
Now there'll never be another woman
And a whole new life begins


The other woman is in for the fight of her life
I've loved him too much
And too long to have him taken away
Oh, that would be the day!

I'm going to bury the hurt
Gonna get down to work
Roll up my sleeves and be what he needs
A lover at night
Oh, and not just a wife
You bet your life

The other woman
Is in for the fight of her life
I've loved him too much
And too long to have him taken away
Oh, that would be the day!

I'm going to bury the hurt
Gonna get down to work
Roll up my sleeves and be what he needs
A lover at night
Oh, and not just a wife
You bet your life
