You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you

You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me

You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love
Never my love
