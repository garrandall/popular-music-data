Telly Man, standin' on a band stand, grand standin'
Bendin' and bangin' them strings
Eye-candy shakin' on the dance floor
Sayin', "Play me one more", makin' a scene

Cowboy camped on a bar stool
Shootin' double whiskey with a longneck back
And Billy with a pool cue, staring down an eight ball
Lookin' at Kelly with a rack

Out in the country, back roads and one-horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
To the Honky Tonk Stomp

Yeah, pickups in the parking lot
Rockin' like a jukebox, jumpin' in the July air
Cooler in the tool box, drinkin' every last drop
Won't let you take it in there

Whiskey high, two dudes stumblin' out the back door
Bouncers help 'em take it outside
Through the fussin' and the cussin' and the shovin' and the pushin'
Well, there really ain't much of a fight

Out in the country, back roads and one-horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
To the Honky Tonk Stomp

Out in the country, back roads and one-horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
To the Honky Tonk Stomp
