Forever yours
Forever mine, my sweet
Forever you
Forever me to keep
Forever, and ever
Forever mine, number one
My number one
Forever girl
You share my world with me
And with you
There's nothing else I need
Forever, and ever
Forever mine
Forever yours

When I was just a lonely man
In a lonely world
Your love
Stood the test of time
Whenever I need you
Girl, you came running
To be my side

Forever yours
Forever mine, my sweet
Forever you
Forever me to keep
Don't worry
Don't worry babe
This man's forever yours
When I was just a lonely man
In a lonely world
Your love
Stood the test of time
Whenever I need you
Girl, you came running
To be by my side
Forever yours
Forever
Forever mine
Forever me to keep
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry baby
This man's forev... forever yours
