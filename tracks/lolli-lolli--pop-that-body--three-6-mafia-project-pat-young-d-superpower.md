Now lawdy lawdy lawdy (Lawdy) please Lord have some mercy (Mercy)
This girl is throwin Judy (Judy) I think she 'bout to hurt me (Hurt me)
See she went front to back (Back) then she went side to side (Side)
My thumb up like hitchhikers (Hikers) I think I need a ride (Ride)
One pocket full of pills (Pills) and a little bag of that Cola (Cola)
The other one full of weed (Weed) and a semi auto pistol-a (Tol-a)
See I ain't no dancin dude (Dude), but I can lean like a cholo (Cholo)
See ma', you go with me 'cause I can't be goin' home solo (solo)

They call me the Juice when I'm at the strip club
I put down a hundred or a du-uh-uh-uhhhb
It don't matter to a player I'm a stu-uh-uh-uhhhd
Cause when I leave the club I'ma fu-uh-uh-uhhhck
You can ride with the mane if you givin' up the brain
Little scared to ride witcha I don't even know your name
There's a whole lotta room in the front of the Range
Like Barack Obama said yeah it's time for a change
Pull over on the road on the back seat (Back seat)
Pop that body now you got me (Got me)
You a fine chick kinda classy (Classy)
Said her name was Tina, now I'm grabbin' (Grabbin')
'Cause she got grip on the whip
With her big round booty with the silicone tits
See she bouncin' on my lap and she tryin' to unzip
I whispered in her ear "Yeah +It's Hard For a Pimp+"


Lolli lolli lolli lolli, let me see you pop that body
Lolli lolli lolli lolli, let me see you pop that body
Chocolate lolli, cherry lolli
'Nilla lolli, pink lolli
Red hot, red hot, red hot hot
Make that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh



All my ladies with a body, put yo' hands in the AIR
You's a good lookin' hottie, put yo' hands in the AIR
Project Pat, lookin' for a model, poppin' that booty, I'ma pop bottles
Your girl's a cutie, know she gargles, don't get mad, I keep them hollows


Shorty hot, watch her rock, let me see that lolli pop
Body rock, don't you stop, I love the way that booty drop
Sideways, front back, up and down I like that
Cherry lolli, chocolate lolli, I wanna see you pop that lolli


Lolli lolli lolli lolli, let me see you pop that body
Lolli lolli lolli lolli, let me see you pop that body
Chocolate lolli, cherry lolli
'Nilla lolli, pink lolli
Red hot, red hot, red hot hot
Lick that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh
Make that lolli pop, oh
