Here I am
Broken wings
Quiet thoughts
Unspoken dreams
Here I am
Alone again
And I need her now
To hold my hand


She's all, she's all I ever had
(She's the air I breathe)
She's all, she's all I ever had


It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need


So much time
So much pain
But there's one thing
That still remains
The the way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there


She's all, she's all I ever had
(In a world so cold, so empty)
She's all, she's all I ever had




It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need



She's all, she's all I ever had


It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need


Here I am
