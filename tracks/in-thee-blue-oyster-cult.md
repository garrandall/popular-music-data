Maybe I’ll see you again, baby, and maybe I won’t
Maybe you bought your ticket gone back to Detroit
Aeroplanes make strangers of us all
Give us distance, much too easily
Jim says, “Some destinies should not be delivered”
But you and I see now, baby, that still they are
Winning it makes losers of us all
’Cause the dice roll, so indifferently


Well, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself
In thee!


Tonight it’s hot without you tomorrow be cold
Winter will come along driven by snow
Love, it makes strangers of us all
When we fall, oh, so thoughtlessly


Well, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself
In thee!




Once we breathed the breath of sweet surrender
Pure, pure Arab air filled our atmosphere
But pride it makes stars of us all
Until we fall, for everyone to see


So, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in stranger’s arms
But I wish I could wrap myself
In thee!
I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself
In thee!
