Too wild to care
You got animal stare
You got âstay anywhere' in your eyes
Think you're leading me on but you can be anyone
Cause I know you'll be gone 'fore I rise

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

Staying with you gave us something to do
I almost thought it was true for a while
'Cause there's love in your lies
You're so thinly disguised
You couldn't tell right from wrong if you tried

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

To thee I dedicate this photograph
I'll even sign it âlove to you' again
And when it's faded and forgotten in some book
You'll sometimes look
You'll sometimes look
You'll sometimes look

It's a game, it's a game
No, let's call it a shame
For there's no one to blame just to pay
You were a friend for a day
So don't cry if I say
That you got what you want, it's OK

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

Yeah yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

Hey hey
Yeah yeah Goin'
Yeah yeah Yeah we're goin'
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah We're goin' yeah
