Oh, yeah
Li-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

Sometimes it's so hard to see
The things that we dread so much come about so easily
And in my distress I often pray
Whoa, Jah Jah, please, when will things start to come my way

You know that better days will come
Seems like it's been so long
We seem to forget so easily
Love needs its share of energy

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

I feel so safe in saying
That in the end our love will shine
These quarrels that we're havin', my baby
Could only strengthen us in time

Come on closer to me, girl yeah, don't you see
That anything is possible as long as we believe Jah

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

Now Jah Jah will guide us
Though that goes unsaid
Rather than routin' the system
We'll seek happiness

Build our shelter in the mountains
Next to a blue crystal river
Not until then we will see
Just how bright our future will be

You know that better days will come
Seems like it's been so long
We seem to forget so easily
Love needs its share of energy

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight
