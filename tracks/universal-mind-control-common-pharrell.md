Get Get it 

I am a renegade
I've never been afraid. Fresh and I'm gettin' paid
The future-future of this Age!
From the Chi, so I talk this way.
Twista hate at the Grand marquee.
Rock the faucet like everday.
To the top and I'm on my way. Let's go, uh!


This is that new shit. Keep em' standing in line. That Universal Mind Control, now move your
Behind. You know you like it, it's calling your name. Nigga, this is that new shit and it don't
