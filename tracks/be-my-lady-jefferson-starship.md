I just look at you and I'm hypnotized 
Like I'm drowning now, drowning in your eyes 
You are beautiful, past imagining 
And I want you more, more than anything 

And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight 
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight 
And I want your love 
Be my lady, be my lady, be my lady

Do I ask too much, do I want too much 
Want to know you now, want to feel your touch 
You just look at me, feel the fire start 
Want to make you burn, want to touch your heart 

And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight 
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight 
And I want your love 
Be my lady, be my lady, be my lady, lady
C'mon girl

Got a racing heart and my mind's a roar 
Never felt like this, never loved before 
And it's dangerous, I would willingly 
Burn to ashes now, if you'll stay with me 

And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight 
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight 
And I want your love 
Be my lady, you know I love you now
Be my lady
Won't you be my lady
