Livin' in the city
Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on
But the job demands that you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone

You get a house in the hills
You're payin' everyone's bills
And they tell you that you're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
"Is that who you really are"

Country boy, you got your feet in LA
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in LA
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home

Talkin' on the telephone
Settin' up another day of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Stayin' in touch with the street
When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
'Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
"Is this what it's all about"

Country boy, you got your feet in LA
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in LA
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home
