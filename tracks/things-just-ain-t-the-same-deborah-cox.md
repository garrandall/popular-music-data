(chorus)
Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

Saw you the other day
And I almost lost my mind
I remember the things we did
I can't believe, such a waste of time

Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometims I wanna die
Please help me understand
Why can't my heart just lie

(Chorus)
Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

I'm still in love with you
And I know that you feel it too
But I feel that I can't go on
I just want you to come back home

I'm so ashamed of me
My heart is not complete
I know you walked away
My heart wants you to stay

Chorus (x2)
Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

The water's in my eyes
Can't hide what I feel inside
Said, the tears keep falling down
I can feel when you're not around

I lost control of me
Yet your love's ashamed to see
I just cannot help myself
I don't want nobody else

Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I wanna die
Please help me understand
Why can't my heart just lie
Oh baby

Things just ain't the same (They're not the same)
He could never be you (He'll never)
You should know the pain I feel (You should know the pain)
Understand what I'm going through (that I...feel, oh)

Things just ain't the same (no, not the same)
He could never be you (never be, never be)
You should know the pain I feel (you should be)
Understand what I'm going through (can't you see the water in my eyes?)

Things just ain't the same (it's hard to hide the way I feel inside)
He could never be you (you know that I dont want nobody else)
You should know the pain I feel (since you left me things)
Understand what I'm going through (just ain't the same baby, no)

(fades out)
