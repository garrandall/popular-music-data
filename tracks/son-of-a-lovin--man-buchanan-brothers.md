Get it

The tears that you're
Starting to cry are no good
Cause you know I loved you
Much better than anybody would
And it was understood

That I wouldn't be
Staying around a long time
You knew that someday
I'd wake up, baby
And I'd find somebody
Further down the line

I'm the son of a loving man
My daddy told me
Get you all the loving you can
And I can cause I, I'm the son
I'm the son, son, I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a loving me

My daddy before me told me
That his daddy before him told him
Never wait around and never settle down

Cause there are too many women
Who will hold on tight to a
Loving man who will come along
And treat them right but you
Got to leave with the morning light

I'm the son of a loving man
My daddy told me
Get you all the loving you can
And I can cause I, I'm the son
I'm the son, son, I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a loving me

Na na na na

So don't get upset
Cause I'm going away
Goodbye's the one word
That I never say cause
You know that I'm
Coming back again sometime

Cause I, I'm the son
I'm the son, son, I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a loving me

I'm the son of a loving man
My daddy told me
Get you all the loving you can
Get it

I'm the son of a loving man
My daddy told me
Get you all the loving you can

I'm the son of a loving man
My daddy told me
Get you all the loving you can...
