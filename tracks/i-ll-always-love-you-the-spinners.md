(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

So, you're breakin' my heart
Takin' my sunshine from me
Knowing that I'm to blame
Darling, there's nothing that I can say

Darling, I've got to try
'Cause in my heart I know that I

I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go

(I'll always love you, baby)
(I'll always love you, baby)

Sometimes a man
Has too much pride to see
But losing your love, my darling
Has opened my eyes for me

Darling, you're going away
Hurts me more and more each day

I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go

(I'll always love you, baby)
(I'll always love you, baby)

(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Though you're leavin' me behind
Girl, you'll never be out of my mind

I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go

(I'll always love you, baby)
(I'll always love you, baby)

(I'll always love you) Though the sun is burning out
(I'll always love you) Though my plans may never turn out
(I'll always love you) Girl, you know I
(I'll always love you) Will be lovin' you till I die

I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
I'll always love you
