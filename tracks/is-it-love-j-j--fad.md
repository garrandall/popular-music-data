Sitting around
Waiting for the phone to ring
Hoping it will be the man of my dreams

Sitting, staring
Tossing and turning
Phone, please ring
I'm just burning and burning with

Anticipation
The situation
Makes me think I'm crazy
For waiting around
But just to talk to
Makes my heart pound

I don't understand the feelings I have
But I know my body shivers
When he crosses my path

I hope he lasts forever
Like the heavens above
He makes me feel so good
But is it love?

Love, love, love


I may be young
But my feelings are true
Some people think I don't know what to do
But I do

'Cause that's how I'm living
That's why my man are constantly giving me
Roses and flowers
And beautiful gifts

And I really love the way
It feels when we kiss
But don't get me wrong because
I'm as pure as the snow

I'm waiting for the right man
Don't you know
And when I find him
I hope that we're as tight as a glove
But I have to ask myself, is it love?

Love, love, love


Am I being silly?
Or can this really be?
That I've really fallen in love so easily?

I haven't known him long
But the feelings are real
Content and satisfied is how I feel
Whenever he's near me
And even when he's not

My heart is on fire
And I just can't seem to stop
Wanting him, needing him
Calling out his name
Is it love
Or is it insane?

Only time will tell
If we'll reach the white glove
'Cause I need to know
Is it love?

Love, love, love

Is it love?
