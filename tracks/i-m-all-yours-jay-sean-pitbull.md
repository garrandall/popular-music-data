I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about you gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours


Success is here, and she don't play
I'm ready for it though, throw it my way
Heart sore, and I doubt you can save it
Its soul carries me like thousand sounds baby
Thoughts deep scuba
My mind is free opposite of cuba
Take me for my money or my fame
Papo don't try, see right through ya
Four lawsuits, one near, two down, two to go
Been a expensive year
Good thing I know I was built for the war
I was built to be all yours
Abuelita is a rebel, my mother's fighter
Tia is a G, and my sister a rider


I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about you gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life

And celebrate tonight
And together we gon' touch the sky
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours

Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours


Say it ain't so
You're reading every thought in my mind
Lady, lady, so damn beautiful
That I could just stare at you all night
And girl then the champagne, the music
Just don't feel to sing, no
Cause lately these bright lights don't shine unless you're here with me, baby


I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life



Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours


But I'd do it for you, i'd rap for you girl
I'd laugh for you go, i'd cry for you
Die for you girl, the truth is it's all for you girl

We gon' fly yeah
And we gon' sore yeah
Tonight it is ours yeah
And I'm all yours yeah
Yeah I'm all yours yeah
Yeah I'm all yours yeah
Yeah I'm all yours yeah
Yeah I'm all yours

I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours

Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours
