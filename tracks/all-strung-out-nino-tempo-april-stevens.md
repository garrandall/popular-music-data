I just can't get enough of you baby
There just ain't enough of you to go around
Just when I'm needin' you baby
You ain't no where to be found
Baby, it's gettin' me down
Because I'm all strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
Oh, maybe, maybe someday you'll love me too
Maybe, maybe I don't know what to do
Baby, baby, I'm all strung out on you
It hurts when you needle me baby (it hurts when you needle me)
But I'd rather have the pain than lose your love
I know you're no good for me baby
But I keep trampin' around, trackin' you all over town
Because I'm all strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
Oh, maybe,maybe someday you'll love me too
Maybe, maybe I don't know what to do
Baby, baby, I'm all strung out on you
I love you (I love you) (I love you) (I love you)
Just the way you are
Like a spinnin' shinin' star:
I'm gonn'a get you someday
And you'll never go away
Because I'm all strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
Oh, baby, baby, someday you'll love me, too
Baby, baby, I don't see but I'm all strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out on you baby
All strung out
