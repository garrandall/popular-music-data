She moves like a mystic
Like a priestess, tall and pale
She lays down the mystery
All her secrets are unveiled

Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there

And she takes possession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire

Her words fall in echoes
Ringing bells like gypsy rhymes
She has the power
No believer can explain

Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there


And she takes possession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire

Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there



She takes possession
Touch the fire
Touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire
