It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

Remember when I drove you home from work
I loved the way when you kissed me bye
All your friends think I'm just too young for you
You tell 'em that I can do what guys their age can do, oh, baby

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right, oh

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me, oh, baby

Let me love you down, ooh, oh
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

Let me love you down, ooh
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right
I can love you down

Let me love you, love you, love you, love you
Let me love you, love you, love you, love you
Let me love you down
(Love you down)

I know, I know I could
Let me love you down
(Love you down)
I know it's gonna take all night

Let me love you down
(Love you down)
No, no, no, no
Let me love you down, oh
(Love you down)

Let me love from dawn
Take the house and the car
I love like you are, whoa
Love you down, down, down, baby

Love you down, down, down
Oh, woah, woah
I know, I know I could, yeah
Let me love you down, woah, woah

It's just me and you the whole night through
Let me love you, baby
I know, I know I could
Love you down, down, oh

Let me love you, I know I could, baby
You're so sweet to me, woah, woah
Let me love you down, ooh, baby
It's just you and me, baby the whole night through
Won't you let me love down
I can't take this too much longer, you know
