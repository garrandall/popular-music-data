Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parkin' lot
It was 2 for 1 and 4 for 2
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up, like I was on you

I say "Hey, hey, baby do you wanna come over"
You say "No way", then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my

T-Shirt, right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt (Yeah)
(You look good in my t-shirt, girl)
(Oh yeah)

We were walkin' up the stairs with the neighbors sayin', keep it down
But, it's hard to unlock the door when you're makin' out (know what I'm sayin')
You've been sayin' that we've gotta quit doing this,
So, why you leanin' in for one more kiss,
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

T-Shirt, right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt (in my t-shirt)

(Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look g-ood on my mind)

I say "Hey, hey, baby do you wanna come over"
You say "No way", then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were in my T-Shirt
(Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt)

I see you spinnin' around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot

In my T-Shirt right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt

(Nah nah nah nah nah-nah-nah)
(You look good in my t-shirt, baby)
(Yeah, you look so good in my t-shirt)
(Yeah baby, you look good in my t-shirt)
(Oh yes, you look so good in my t-shirt)
(Nah nah nah nah nah-nah-nah)
