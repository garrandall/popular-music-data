Wait, wait, wait a little longer
You  might just hcange your mind
Think,  think, think a little stronger
Let your memory unwind

Something tells me you're not to sure
So  just before you walk out that door
Remember  what you're leaving behind
And could she do it better

What's  she got that I ain't got
What's she have that I have not
What can she do that I can't do
What's she got over you

I'm  telling you now you ever walk out on me
Stop, Stop and think about it
You're making a mistake
Who, who, who know's you better
Can't you see that you're on the make

Something tells me you're not too sure
So just before you walk out that door
Remember what you're leaving behind
And could she do it better

What's she got that I ain't got
What's she have that I have not
What can she do that I can't do
What's she got over you

Could she love you better?
Could she love you better?
Could she make you happy?
Could she give you more than you took from me?

I'm trying not to think about
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me
She can't take you away

Tell me are you really sure

What's she got that I ain't got
What's she have that I have not
What can she do that I can't do
What's she got over you

What's she got that I ain't got
What's she have that I have not
What can she do that I can't do
What's she got over you

What's she got that I ain't got
What's she have that I have not
What can she do that I can't do
What's she got over you
