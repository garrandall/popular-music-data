(Down to...)

I thought that there goes my honey
My happy shoes
Find someone
To help me lose these blues

I'm takin' my body down
(To love town!)
(Love love love!)


Goin' down...
Goin' down...

(Goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I'm goin' down...
Goin' down...

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss -- didn't miss you!

(Down to...)

I thought that there goes my honey
My happy shoes
Find someone
To help me lose these blues

I'm goin' down to the town!
Down, down, down love town!

Goin' down...
Goin' down...
Goin' down...

(Goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

Goin' down...

(Goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I'm rid of you

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss -- didn't miss you!

(paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise)
(paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise)
