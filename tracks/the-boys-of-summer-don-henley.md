Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The Sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home


But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of


I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
I see you walking real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...


I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
