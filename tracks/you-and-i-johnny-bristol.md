You and I, you and I
Sounds like a whole lotta fun
You and I, you and I
Sounds like it oughta be one
One good love affair
You and I, you and I
Sounds like the right combination
You and I, you and I
Sounds like a good creation
Baby, for a love affair
So let's give our love a chance
Together, we can make it grow
Build love's eternal fire
So the whole wide world will know
We're proud of this love affair
We need each other, baby
That helps to make the pact
But it hurts me to my heart
To see us so far apart
You and I, you and I
Sounds like a whole lotta fun
You and I, you and I
That sounds like one
One good love affair, oh, yeah
Think about the time we wasted
The days and nights we spent
Think about two friends who were lovers
And who could never have the strength

Oh, we're doing ourselves an injustice
And I don't think that's fair
Cause the kind of love we got
Oh, it's truly rare
Oh, you and I, you and I
Sounds like the right combination
Hey, baby, you and I, you and I
Sounds like a good creation
Baby, for a love affair, oh, yeah
Oh, you and I, you and I
Sounds like you and I
One good love affair, oh, yeah
We owe it to each other, baby
And it brings me to bitter tears
Everytime I think about
All those wasted years
Cause you and I, you and I
Sounds like a whole lotta fun
Baby, you and I, you and I
Yeah, I betcha that's one
One good love affair, oh, yeah
Hey, baby, you and I, you and I
Sounds like the right combination
Oh, baby, you and I, you and I
I bet you that's a good creation
For a damn good love affair
