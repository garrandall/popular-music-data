Yeah

Mm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mhm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, uh
I was taught to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'

Yeah, ha ha, perky, perky, dirty soda
Ayy, only talk bags on the Motorola
Ayy, push the Hellcat like an old Corolla
Ayy, I'ma let these racks talk for me nigga
Bitch I done ride with the shooters, ayy
Made my cousin a killer
In the '15, I was neighborhood drug dealer
I'm so cold hearted, I can't show no love, nigga
But I fuck that bitch to PARTYNEXTDOOR, "Persian Rugs", nigga, uh
Bought a brand new AP, it was 50.000 total
It feel like the Flu Game, when I sold out the Novo
I had to finess and get the bag, I had mad dough though
If he ain't try and go get the safe, I get it crackin' solo

Mm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mhm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, uh
I was taught to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'

Bird vision, bank account
Had a bad bitch put a 100.000 in her spandex
That 100 that made me million, I got it laminated
Can't fuck with none of these broke niggas, they contaminated
Thank God for all of these bluefaces, I barely done made it
Made 40.000 on new years, took a private to Vegas
I been on promethazine so long, when I'm slidin' I'm faded
I been tryin' to get a crib so long, now I got it, it's gated
I been touchin' all of these millions, I know they gon' hate it
My chef cook up Filet Mignon, got sauce and then ate it
Nigga I been ballin' every season like Kobe with eight
All these niggas gon' hate
I stayed down and got rich, now I'm fuckin' on this lil' baby

Mm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mhm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, uh
I was taught to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'
