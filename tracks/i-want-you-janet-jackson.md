Feels like I'm going in circles
You're like a maze I can't get through
Should I go left
Should I go right
Should I let you
Stay for the night
It's like a seesaw
When it comes to your love
Boy when you're up
This girl is down
And I just can't
Figure it out
Cause you know that I want you
Yeah
And you know that I need you
Yeah
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
Yeah
These tears can you wipe 'em
Yeah
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
I'm going out with guys
I don't wanna go
To places that I've been before
They pitchin' the same game
Boy it's a damn shame
How I wish it was you
Calling me
I want it to be you
Holdin' me
Boy it needs to be you
Kissing me
Cause it's like a seesaw
When it comes to your love
Boy when you're up
This girl is down
And I just can't
Figure it out
Cause you know that I want you
Yeah
And you know that I need you
Yeah
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
Yeah
These tears can you wipe 'em
Yeah
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
Listen
Have your way with me
(Have your way with me)(Have your way with me)
Anytime anywhere
(Anytime anywhere)(Anytime anywhere)
Have your way
(Have your way)
However I don't care
(However)
(Have)
Have your way with me
(Have your way with me)(Have your way with me)
And you can have it tonight
(You can have it)
Tonight
(Tonight)
Tonight
Boy tonight
(Tonight)

Cause you know that I want you
Yeah
And you know that I need you
Yeah
(Haaaahh)
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
Yeah
These tears can you wipe 'em
(These tears can you wipe them)
Yeah
Is that any way to be
(Is that any way to be)
Just have your way with me
(Baby have your way with me)
Cause you know that I want you
(Cause you know that I want you baby)
Yeah
And you know that I need you
(And you know that I need you baby)
Yeah
Is that any way to be
(In my life, I need you...)
Just have your way with me
(...I want you, body is cryin' for you baby)
My body is cryin'
Yeah
(Boooooooohoo)
These tears can you wipe 'em
Yeah
(Boooooooohoo)
Is that any way to be
Just have your way with me
