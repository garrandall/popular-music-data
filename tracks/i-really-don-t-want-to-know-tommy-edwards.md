I really don't want to know
Les Paul & Mary Ford/Tommy Edward

How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many, I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many, I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you
Darlin don't confess
Just let it remain your secret
But darlin I love you so
No Wonder, no wonder I wonder
Though I really don't want to know
