The Goddess is coming,
The Goddess is coming
The Goddess is here

Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine
Marc Anthony and Cleopatra
Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio
Lady Marian and Robin Hood
Tarzan and Jane
Norman Bates and his mother
They all have one thing in common
At some point in time she turned to him
And spoke these unforgettable words

Sexual, let's get sexual
Let's get sexual
It's only natural
Sexual, it's natural
Let's get sexual
Do it, do it, do it, ah

Hey little boy, what you gonna do tonight
Hey little boy, gonna make you feel right
Hey little boy, you got the key to my lock
Hey little boy, let the cradle rock

Let's get, let's get
Sexual, oh let's get sexual
Let's get sexual
It's only natural
Sexual, it's natural
Let's get sexual
Do it, do it, do it, ah

George and Barbara
Adam and Eve
Michael Jackson and Bubbles
Hansel and Gretel
Charles and Diana
John Derek and Ursula and Linda and Bo
Romeo and Juliet
Elvis and Priscilla
And some point in time she turned to him
And spoke these unforgettable words

Sexual, let's get sexual
Let's get sexual
It's only natural
Sexual, it's natural
Let's get sexual
Do it, do it, do it, ah
