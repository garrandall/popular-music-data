When I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
I got troubles, whoa, oh
I got worries, whoa, oh
I got wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
Said to, just to ease my pain
I got troubles, whoa, oh
I got worries, whoa, oh
I came home again

But I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
Yeah, I got troubles, whoa, oh
I got worries, whoa, oh
I got wounds to bind

Hey, I got a feeling
Down in my shoes
Said a-way down in my shoes
Hey, I got to ramble, whoa, oh
I got to move on, whoa, oh
I got to walk away my blues

But I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
Hey, I got troubles, whoa, oh
I got worries, whoa, oh
I got wounds to bind
