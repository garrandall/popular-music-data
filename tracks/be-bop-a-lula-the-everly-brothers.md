Well, be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby doll,
My baby doll, my baby doll
She's the woman in the red blue jeans
She's the woman that's the queen of the teens
She's the one woman that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby doll,
My baby doll, my baby doll

She's the woman that's a got that beat
She's the woman with the flying feet
She's the one woman that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby doll,
My baby doll, my baby doll

Be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby
Be bop a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a-lula, she's my baby doll,
My baby doll, my baby doll
