I have come to indecision
Someone is pushing me
All the cities, subways, rivers
No direction left for me
I have lost my way home early
I don't care cause I won't stay there
All I hear is this silent whisper
"Will you be here again"


Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you


I have seen your eyes in purple
I have seen your eyes in blue
All the flowers, tears and faces
All the days I spent with you
Again and again, Ive been escaping
I've been lost in the dark, I fear
Can you hear this silent whisper
Will you be here again?


Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you


Choose and change you say
How can you let this run away
See the storms through your broken window
See the beauty of the falling rain
Everyday, I've been without you
Everyday, shadow follows me
Can't you see you left your traces
In too many faces


Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you


Imagination takes the shadows away
Everyday, I've been without you
Imagination keeps the shadows away
Everyday, I stay without you
Too many times, without you
