I hear a voice... in the room next to mine
Feels good... sounds good...
Closes the door from behind
And another voice... comes thru the door

I am dealing with a man
When away from me... stays deep inside my heart
And he says if anyone falls in love
It will be one of us

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere... in the twilight... dreamtime
Somewhere... in the back of your mind
If anyone falls...

And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away
He said "I have loved many women
I have many times... run away"

Oh... I have never known the words
Well I have tried to be true
Well I have never known what to say
How to say... seen anything today
Never seen... anything... like you

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere... in the twilight... dreamtime
Somewhere... in the back of your mind
If anyone falls...

So I'm never gonna see you
Never gonna see you... deep inside my heart
Oh I see your shadow against
Shadow against... shadow against the wall
Baby I see your shadow against the wall
