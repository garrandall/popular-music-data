Love, was the game
Fool, was my name
I thought you'd know wrong from right
But you ran to his arms tonight

Shame, shame
We had a good thing, baby
Shame, shame
He doesn't love you, baby
Shame, shame
He'll only break your heart
And leave you standing out in the rain
Shame, shame

I was your clown
But he'd be around
You call him up on your stage
But he's acting out every page

Shame, shame
We had a good thing, baby
Shame, shame
He doesn't love you, baby
Shame, shame
He'll only break your heart
And leave you standing out in the rain
Shame, shame

I thought you'd know wrong from right
But you ran to his arms tonight

Shame, shame
We had a good thing, baby
Shame, shame
He doesn't love you, baby
Shame, shame
He'll only break your heart
And leave you standing out in the rain
Shame, shame

Hey!

Shame, shame
We had a good thing, baby
Shame, shame
He doesn't love you, baby
Shame, shame
He'll only break your heart
And leave you standing out in the rain
Shame, shame
