There's a smile on the wind as it touches my face
And starts to erase all the gloom
And the sun with a kiss, begins to dismiss the
Memory of my life without you
Well it seems like yesterday that my path took me away
Although I know it's been at least a year
But now my path heads home
And your patient time alone
Has brought me even closer to you, dear

And this plane gets closer
Every minute I look down to a watch that keeps looking back at me
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."
How can I be strong?

And this the plane gets closer
Every minute I look down to watch that keeps looking back at me
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."
How can I be strong?

Well the plane is finally down
And the engines stopped their sound
And I look in the crowd and there you stand
And the gap that once was time
Is forever closed behind
I told you I'd come back and here I am
