Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again
It's a game I just can't win
There you are breathin' soft on my skin
Still you won't let me in

So come on

Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby let the moment take your heart away

Have you ever needed someone so bad
Have you ever wanted someone
You just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I gotta have
I gotta have you baby

Come on

There you go, midnight promises again
But they're broken by the dawn
You wanna go further, faster every day, baby
But in the morning you'll be gone

And I'm alone

Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby let the moment take your heart away

Have you ever needed someone so bad
Have you ever wanted someone
You just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

Every dream I dream
is like some kinda rash and reckless scene
To give out such crazy love
You must be some kinda drug

And if my time don't ever come
For me you're still the one
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
I gotta get a fix on you

Have you ever needed someone so bad
Have you ever wanted someone
You just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad, so bad

Have you ever wanted someone
(have you ever wanted someone)
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I gotta have
I gotta have you baby

It's a game I just can't win

Have you ever needed someone so bad
Have you ever wanted someone
(have you ever wanted someone)
You just can't have
Did you ever try so hard
