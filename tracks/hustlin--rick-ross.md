Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm, every day I'm


Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I'm the fuckin' boss
745, white-on-white, that's fuckin' Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat
I keep 'em comin' back, we keep 'em comin' back
I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them motherfuckers flyin' across the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega
The real Noriega, he owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty nigga, we buy the whole thang
See most of my niggas really still deal cocaine
My roof back, my money rides
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatched Black, I cried for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lives


Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm, every day I'm


We never steal cars but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard
Ain't 'bout no funny shit, still bitches and business
I'm on my money, shit, still whippin' them Benzes
Major league, who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finished
I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's, you know it's fact, we holdin' sacks
So nigga go on, rat, run and tell 'em that
More cars, more hoes, more clothes, more blow


Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm, every day I'm


It's time to spend my thrills, custom spinnin' wheels
I ain't drove in a week, them bitches spinnin' still
Talk about me cause these suckas scared to talk about me
Killers talkin' 'bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' round me, see all these killers round me
Lotta drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for 22
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
I touch work like I'm Convertible Burt
I got distribution so I'm convertin' the work
In the M.I.YAYO, them niggas rich off that yayo
Steady slangin' yayo, my Chevy bangin' Yayo


Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm hustlin'
Every day I'm, every day I'm
