If you want my love, say it, say it
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, yeah


When I'm with you
You know just what the right things are to do
Your actions move me
But your attitude, it makes me so confused


You lead me on in the right direction
Then you let me down without protection
Ain't gonna be your sacrifice
Just a few words that might sound nice
There ain't no use in playing games
I'm wanting you, do you feel the same?
When in comes down to the bottom line
I really gotta know, am I wasting time?


If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, yeah


I can see right through you
You're not as cool as you pretend to be
Your reactions tell me you're just waiting
For the words to come from me


You lead me on in the right direction
Then you let me down without protection
Ain't gonna be your sacrifice
Just a few words that might sound nice
There ain't no use in playing games
I'm wanting you, do you feel the same?
When in comes down to the bottom line
I really gotta know, am I wasting time?


If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it


Don't try to disguise what's in your eyes
They're so revealing
I know you're afraid but it's O.K
Say what you feel, oh, yeah


If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, yeah


Don't try to disguise what's in your eyes
They're so revealing
I know you're afraid but it's O.K
Say what you feel, oh, yeah


If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, oh
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, oh
If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it
If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it
If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
What it's all about, say it, say it
If you want my love
If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, yeah
