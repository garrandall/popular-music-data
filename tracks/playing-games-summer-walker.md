Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever ask you take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No

All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you're alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

So won't you say my name, say my name
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You actin' kinda shady, you ain't been callin' me, "Baby"
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games

I know you say you hit my line, I'm on your mind and that
You want this bad, so I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction, is you really bout that action?

Really wanna give you all, but flex in front of your friends (How that work?)
Swear that you're doin' the most, but we take a picture can't post it (How that work?)
Quit your talkin'? Back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

So won't you say my name, say my name
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You actin' kinda shady, you ain't been callin' me, "Baby"
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games

Games (games)
Games (oh games)

We got London on the track
