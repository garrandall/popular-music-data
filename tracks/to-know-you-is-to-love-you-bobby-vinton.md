Why can't you see?
Oh, how blind can you be?

To know, know, know you
Is to love, love, love you
Just to see you smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know you
Is to love, love, love you
And I do, yes I do, yes I do

I'll be good to you
And I'll bring love to you
Oh, everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk along side of you
And to know, know, know you
Is to love, love, love you
And I do, yes I do, yes I do

Why can't you see?
Oh, how blind can you be?
Someday you'll see
That you were meant for me

To know, know, know you
Is to love, love, love you
Just to see you smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know you
Is to love, love, love you
And I do, yes I do, yes I do
And I do, yes I do, yes I do
Yes I do
