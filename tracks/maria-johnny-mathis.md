Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard 
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
All the beautiful sounds of the world 
In a single word 
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria 
Maria, Maria
Maria
I just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me
Maria,
I just kissed a girl named Maria
And suddenly I found
How wonderful a sound can be
Maria,
Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria

Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
