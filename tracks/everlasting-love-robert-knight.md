Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away, just when you, you needed me so
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?


Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

(Need a love to last forever)
(Need a love to last forever)


Where life's river flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine, it's eternal love
When other's love-light's gone, ours will be strong
We'll have our very own, everlasting love

(Real love to last forever)
(Real love to last forever)


Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
