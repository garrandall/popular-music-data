(I wish I could've been there myself)


It’s what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been
I wish I could’ve been there myself
I made so much, spent so much
And I can't get enough
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)


Your second cousin lives in Orlando (Orlando)
And yeah, I just finished a show (Just finished a show)
People shoving shots down their damn throat
Some selling yes but I'm gonna say no (Gonna say no)


It's what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been (I’ve been)
I wish I could’ve been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)
I made so much, spent so much
And I can’t get enough (I can't get enough)
I wish I could've been there myself


All of this American dreamin'
Everybody’s sick of believin'
Oh, let's not give a fuck 'til
Giving a fuck has no meaning
Oh, I'm sick of believing
All of this American dreaming
Oh, let's not give a fuck 'til
Giving a fuck has no meaning, oh


It's what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)
I made so much, spent so much
And I can't get enough (No, I can't get enough)
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)


No, I can't get enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh
