Paint two eyes,
Make them cry
Paint two lips,
Make them lies.
And you're painting
The portrait of a fool.

Paint one heart
That's been untrue
Paint one soul
Make it blue.
And your paintin'
The portrait of a fool.

There are somethings that look so familiar
Strange what this resemblance can be
And now as I look in the mirror
I know, I know the fool you are painting is me.

Paint one fool
Let it talk
Paint two hand
That once held it all.
And you've painted
A portrait of a fool...
