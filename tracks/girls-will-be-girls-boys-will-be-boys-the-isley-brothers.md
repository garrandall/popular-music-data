Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now
They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh, don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but (Incomprehensible)
You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
