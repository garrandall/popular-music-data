(You should be here)
You should really be here with me, baby
You should really be here with me, baby
(You should be here)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
(You should be here)
You should really be here with me, babe
(Ooh ooh, ooh, girl, I wish you were here)
I just wanna drive you crazy


You should be here in the mornin' time
When I'm makin' my breakfast
You should be here beneath me
To feel me, to heal me
You should be here to wrap me
To trap me and climb me
You should be here, I'm a good man
And I work hard on my night job


(You should be here)
Let me show you what you're missin' every day
(You should be here)
Once I get you, you ain't never gonna walk away
(You should be here)
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money
(Ooh girl, I wish you were here)
You should be here, you should be here


You should be here in the evenin'
Get to sleazin', and teasin'
Forget your reasons
Why you should not
Oh, lady you should see the tricks that I got
Oh, for you, mama
Especially here
Be my lady, let's get lazy and make babies
Oh...


(You should be here)
Let me show you what you're missin' every day, yeah
(You should be here)
Once I get you, you ain't never gonna walk away, yeah
(You should be here)
See, I got more than just some good dick and some money
(Ooh, girl, I wish you were here)
You should be here, you should be here
('Cause I don't like bein' lonely)


You should be here with me, babe
You should be here with me, babe
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
You should really be here with me, babe
You should really be here with me, babe
I just wanna drive you crazy
I just wanna drive you crazy


You should be here
Oh...yeah (oh...yeah, yeah, yeah)
You should be here
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
You should be here
Oh...oh...oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, girl, i wish you were here
Oh...oh...oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wish you were here with me, baby
Girl, I wish you were here


(You should be here)
You don't know what you are missin' every day
(You should be here)
Well, in my dreams last night I think I had you every way
(You should be here)
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money
(Ooh, girl, I wish you were here)
You should be here, you should be here, yeah, yeah, yeah


Said I really want, babe
(I said I really want you, babe)
Said I really want, babe
(Wish you were here with me)
Said I really want, babe
Said I really want, babe
(Oh, really, really want you alone with me)
Said I really want, babe
Said I really want, babe
(Said I really want you alone with me)
Said I really want, babe, hey, hey...
