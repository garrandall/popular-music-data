Sorrow is a lonely feeling
Unsettled is a painful place
I've lived with both
For far too long now
Since we've parted ways

I've been wrestling
With my conscience
And I found myself to blame
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel my pride away

Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down

Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom now

Just between you and me
I've got something to say

If confession is the road to healing
Forgiveness is the promised land, oh
I'm reaching out in my conviction
I'm longing to make amends, yeah

So I'm sorry for
The words I've spoken
For I've betrayed a friend
We've got a love
That's worth preserving
And a bond I will defend

Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down

Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom

Just between you and me
I've got something to say

In my pursuit of God
I thirst for holiness
As I approach the Son
I must consider this

Offenses unresolved
Will keep me from the throne
Before I go to Him
My wrong must be atoned

If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel this pride away
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down

Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom

It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
So let me say it today

It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
Confession needs to be made

It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
Confession needs to be made

It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
