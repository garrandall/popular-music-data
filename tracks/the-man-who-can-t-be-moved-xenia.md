Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this boy, can you tell him where I am?"

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just brokenhearted
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, "Can't stay here"
I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If he changes his mind, this is the first place he will go"

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving

And maybe I'll be famous as the one who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you

I'm the one who can't be moved
I'm the one who can't be

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on a corner of the street

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on a corner of the street

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
