There's a new world somewhere they call the Promised Land
And I'll be there someday if you will hold my hand
I still need you there beside me no matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you

There is always someone to reach across they say
And you'll be my someone forever and today
I could search the whole world over until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you

It's a long long journey so stay by my side
When I'll walk through the storm
You'll be my guide (be my guide)
If they gave me a fortune my pleasure would be small
I could lose it all tomorrow and never mind at all
But if I should lose your love dear I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you



But if I should lose your love dear I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you another you another you
