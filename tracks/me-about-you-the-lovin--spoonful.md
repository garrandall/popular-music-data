Perhaps another time or maybe 'nother place
Could've eased my mind, would've never seen your face
Or heard about you
But now you call my name & your reality
Though it's hard to explain, I know I'll never be
Without you
I know nothing about you
But I know I don't doubt your love & I know that it's real
By God above I know I feel about you

Got a handful of gold & a pocketful of dreams
But a heart full of love & I know what it means
To be without you
Just sit by my side & share with me
All the feelings inside & the things you see
About you
I know Miss Lonely will be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so hear me say
The from now on I'll stay about you

I know Miss Lonely will be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so hear me say
The from now on I'll stay about you
About you, about you, about
