I'm back on the street again
Gotta stand on my own two feet again
And I'm walkin' that beat again
Rememberin' when, oh
Rememberin' when

Got a tear in my eye again
Reminding me that I might cry again
Feelin' sad wonderin' why again
Rememberin' when, oh
Rememberin' when

Once I used to think that the world
Belonged to me
Now it belongs to someone else

So, I'm thinkin' of me again
That's the way it's gonna be again
'Til the day I can be again
Rememberin' when, oh
Rememberin' when

So, I'm thinkin' of me again
That's the way it's gonna be again
'Til the day I can be again
Rememberin' when, oh
Rememberin' when, oh
Rememberin' when, mm
Rememberin' when
