(Yeah) I admit you got the biggest brown eyes
And you know how to part your lips to tantalize, sure
(Yeah) You can get any man you want goin' and you do it
And don't say you don't know you do

Well, baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it

I love you, I love you, I do, little girl
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you, I  do, girl
Choose, is it him or me (is it him or me)

(Yeah) Just 'cause I ain't been sayin' it, girl
You should be ashamed of what I've been seein' - bad
(Yeah) You better watch your step or, girl
You can bet you're gonna lose the best thing you ever had

I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
