Mary said
That Jenny said
That Willie said
That Johnny said
That Susie said
That you don't love me anymore
Not anymore

The walls have ears
And the windows have eyes
Everybody is wise
They know our dreams went wrong
Our dreams went wrong

The whispering wind
Told the babbling brook
And the babbling brook
Can't keep a secret long
Not very long

And though I try to hide
The longing that fills my heart
Fills my heart
Somehow that lonely tear
Plays peek-a-boo

Oh, the walls have ears
And the windows have eyes
Everybody is wise
They know I still love you
I still love you

Mary said
That you don't love me anymore
Willie said
That you don't love me
But everybody's wise
They know I still love you
You

Mary said
That Jenny said
That Willie said
That Johnny said
That Susie said
That Jenny said
That Willie said
That Johnny said
That Susie...
