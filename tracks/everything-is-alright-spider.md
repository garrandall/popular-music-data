I was getting dressed late one night
Along came a spider and I got a fright
Oh I could not squash it flat no matter how I tried
And when it looked me in the eye I ran away to hide...

I put on me Doctor Martin shoes
A battle with the spider that I wasn't gonna loose
A kick from the left a kick from the right
I was on the floor but I was alright
It was gonna be a long long night

Spiders in the dressing room
Spiders everywhere
Spiders in the dressing room
Beware

Things were getting hot and I had to take a chance
The spider got impatient started crawling up me pants
I shook it off me leg thump it hit the ground
Everything was silent so I didn't make a sound

I crossed the room as happy as can be
I had killed the spider now it couldn't bother me
But with me arm on the light he was there ready for a fight
It was gonna be a long long night

Spiders in the dressing room
Spiders everywhere
Spiders in the dressing room
Beware

It was getting late and the spider wasn't dead
An audience had gathered round and I was going red
I put a jam jar on the floor the spider crawled inside it
I screwed the lid back on the top and threw the jar outside

At a party late that night everything was bright and gay
We played all our pop records and danced the night away
Early in the morning came a knocking at the door
I opened it slowly guess what I saw
It was gonna be a long long night...

Spiders in the dressing room
Spiders everywhere
Spiders in the dressing room
Beware
Spiders in the dressing room
Spiders everywhere
Spiders in the dressing room
Beware

Spiders, spiders, spiders...
Spiders in the dressing room
