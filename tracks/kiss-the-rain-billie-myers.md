Hello
Can you hear me?
Am I gettin' through to you?
Hello
Is it late there?
There's a laughter on the line
And do you swear you're there alone?
Cause I, I'm trying to explain
Something's wrong
But it just don't sound the same
Why don't you, why don't you, go outside, go outside?

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind, we're under the same sky
And the night's, as lonely for me as for you
If you feel, you can't wait til morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain

Hello
Do you miss me?
I hear you say you do
But not the way I'm missing you
Well, what's new?
How's the weather?
Is it stormy where you are?
Cause I'm so close but it feels like you're so far
Oh, would it mean anything
If you knew, what I'm left imagining?
In my mind, in my mind, would you go, would you go
Think of me, think of me

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind, we're under the same sky
And the night's, as lonely for me as for you
If you feel, you can't wait til morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain

Can you hear me?
Am I gettin' through to you?

And you're tall over me
Think of me, think of me, think of me, only me

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind, we're under the same sky
And the night's, as lonely for me as for you
If you feel, you can't wait til morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Oh...
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
