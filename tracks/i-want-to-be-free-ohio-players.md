One day child, I won't have to listen to your lies
On that day, I'll be able to make up my own mind
You know, I think I done finally realized
And now I think I can put you out of my life

I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to speak my mind, all the time)

I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!

And one morning,
I won't be afraid to leave
And all those things that you told me
I never could conceive

I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to speak my mind, all the time)

I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!

You don't know how it makes me feel child,
To be able to walk away from your smile
And I'm gonna be alright, after awhile
I think the Lord done gave me a strength now

I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to speak my mind, all the time)

I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!

One day I'm gonna be free honey,
And nothing can make me stay, not even your money.
I know you're gonna think that I'm acting funny,
But I'm getting away from you honey.

I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to run away)
I'm gonna be free! (I want to be free to speak my mind, all the time)

I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
I want to be free!
