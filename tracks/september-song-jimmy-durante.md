When I was a young man, caught in the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossin curls
I let the old earth take a couple of whirls
While I apply her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around, she came my way
And as time came around, she came

Oh it's a long, long while, from May to December
But the days grow short, when you reach September
When the autum weather, turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time, for the waiting game

Oh, the days, dwindle down, to a precious few
September. November
And these few precious days, I'll spend with you
These precious days, I'll spend with you

Oh, the days dwindle down, to a precious few
September. November
And these few precious days, I'll spend with you
These precious days, I'll spend with you
