Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired, she needs a rest, the kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep, he can't hang around


Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our...


Our house, it has a crowd
There's always something happening and it's usually quite loud
Our mum, she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down, and a mess is not allowed


Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

Our house, in the middle of our street
(Something tells you that you've got to move away from it)
Our house, in the middle of our...


Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt, then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss
She's the one they're going to miss in lots of ways


Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our...


I remember way back then when everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time, such a fine time, such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play, simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us, two dreamers


Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired, she needs a rest, the kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep, he can't hang around


Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our...

Our house, was our castle and our keep
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, that was where we used to sleep
Our house, in the middle of our street

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house...
