I remember when I used to be the jealous kind
I got over it, now you're taking over my old line

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

I ain't doin' nothing that you could really say was wrong
Just one oversight and no that didn't last too long

Listen, you're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

Don't know what you're looking for
What's this thing about "true blue"
You know I ain't no danger boy
You're the one I like to touch, touch you, you
When the mood is right, change the light and the moment's gone
Better turn around, `cause the light doesn't last too long

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you
Imagination, Your Imagination
Imagination, Use Your Imagination.
