Stupid girl
Stupid girls
Stupid girls

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud, so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy, to pay for the champagne
Droppin' names

What happened to the dream of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 cent
They travel in packs of two and three
With their itsy bitsy doggies, and their teeny-weeny tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone
Where, oh where could they be

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Break it down, now

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it, and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more

I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (c'mon)

Disaster's all around
A world of despair
Your only concern
Will they fuck up my hair

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Do ya thing, do ya thing,
Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya
I like this, like this, like this

Pretty will you fuck me girl
Silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl
Stupid girl
Pretty will you fuck me girl
Silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl
Stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl
Stupid girl
Stupid girl
