Stranded alone on a sea of emotion
You found me
Your love was a light
In the darkness that shone
So profoundly
Say that you'll stay
Do not be afraid, afraid
You, you're my breath
The air I breathe
You are my imagination
Su le finesse
Song of my heart
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper

Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me
Wherever you are
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together

Stranded alone on a sea of emotion
You found me
It's you who first found me
Come here, come here
Put your arms around me,
Come here
It's you who surrounds me
Come here, come here
Come here
Come here
You, you're my breath
The air I breathe
You are my imagination
Su le finesse
Song of my heart
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper

I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me
Wherever you are
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together

Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me,
Wherever you are
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
In my...
Heart!
