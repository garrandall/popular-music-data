I know about all your faults
Somehow they never deter me
And there are times when we talk
You really know how to soothe me
There are times I look at you
And I realise that you need me too
But after all is said and done
There's nothing sweeter

So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
Feels so good

Sometimes you say that I'm cold
Don't ever think that you'll lose me
I'll never tire of your hold
'Cos you know just how to move me
Well, you're aware as I am too
That there's good and bad in the things we do
But after all is said and done
There's nothing sweeter

So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
Feels so good

So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
(Is where I wanna be, you and me)
And it feels so good
So close to you
Feels so good
