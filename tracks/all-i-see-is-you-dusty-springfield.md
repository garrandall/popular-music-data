I tried so hard
All summer through
Not to think too much of you
But the more I try
The more I find
I just can't leave the past behind

Times that are happy
Are times that are few
And once I was happy
When I had you

But days have come and gone
Since you were here
Nights are twice as long
Without you near
Pictures on my mind
Stand out so clear
No matter where I am
Or what I do
My darling
All I see is you

You're there in every dream
I ever dream
There at every place
I've ever been
Everyday I find
You're in my heart
And on my mind
I close my eyes
But I'm not blind
I see you still
And when I throw my arms out wide
I find that you're not by my side
But one thing is for sure
Until I do
All I see is you

Everyday I find
You're in my heart
And on my mind
I close my eyes
But I'm not blind
I see you still, oh

I won't live again
'Til I'm with you
Oh, darling
I won't love again
Unless it's with you

So until the day
When you are back with me to stay
In every way
All I see is you
