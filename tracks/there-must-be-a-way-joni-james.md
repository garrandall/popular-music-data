There must be a way to help me forget that we're through
There must be a way to stop me from dreamin' of you
There must be a star in the skies that isn't reflecting your eyes
I just don't know how to disguise how much I miss you

There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you
There must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new
Oh, there must be a way but I can't find a way without you

There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you
Yes, there must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new
Oh, there must be a way but I can't find a way without you
