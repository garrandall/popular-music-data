(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Look homeward, angel
Tell me what you see.
Do the folks I used to know remember me?

Look homeward, angel
Find my lady fair.
Does she dream about the love we used to share?
So she'll know how very much I miss her.
Angel, while she's dreaming, won't you kiss her?

Look homeward, angel
One thing I must know.
Do her empty arms still yearn for me alone?

So she'll know how very much I miss her.
Angel, while she's dreaming, won't you kiss her?

Look homeward, angel
One thing I must know
Do her empty arms still yearn for me alone?

Do her empty arms still yearn for me alone
