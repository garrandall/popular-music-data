Jason, ha ha
Jason Derulo

Jason Derulo
Get jazzy on it
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, riding comfortable
'Cause I know what the girls them need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave

Been around the world don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

You know the words to my songs, no habla ingles
Our conversations ain't long, but you know what is
I know what the girls them want, London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one

Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

(Uno) Met your friend in Rio
(Dos) She was all on me yo
(Tres) We can mÃ©nage a three tho
(Quatro) Oh yeah

2 Chainz
Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis (ooh, damn)
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck (neck)
International oral sex
Every picture I take I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what you expect?
Her pussy's so good, I bought her a pet (stop)
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty

Jason Derulo
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me (you you ah)
Talk dirty to me (yeah)
Talk dirty to me (talk to me)
Talk dirty to me (oh yeah, oh)
Get jazzy on it

What? I don't understand, ha ha
