I hear your voice everywhere
It's echoes of love
Making me look back over my shoulder
Echoes of love are started all over
Echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
I'm out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Darlin', since you went away
Think about you every day
So many memories
Got to get the best of me

Recalling the times
I used to hold you
I just wouldn't do
What I was supposed to
I've done things
I'd like to undo
Now darlin' it's you
I'd like to run to

Echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
I'm out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Love, echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love
