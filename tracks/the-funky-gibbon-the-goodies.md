Come on everybody
It's gibbon time

We're the Goodies
How do you do?
We've just been down to the zoo
We saw a monkey in a cage
Doing a dance
That could be the rage
It's not hard
So let's all do the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo

Do, do, do the funky gibbon
(The funky gibbon)
We are here to show you how
Ooo, oo, oo
Ooo, oo, oo, the funky gibbon
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now

Dogs are always howlin'
Cats are always yowlin'
But gibbons only
Like to sing and dance
Oop, oop, sh boop

You'll be like that monkey
Get a little funky
And in a while
Start to smile
Gibbon half a chance

Do, do, do the funky gibbon
(The funky gibbon)
We are here to show you how
Ooo, oo, oo
Ooo, oo, oo, the funky gibbon
(The funky gibbon)
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo the funky gibbon

G the world would be good
I know how nice it could
B with just a little gibbon take
B just like that gibbon
O you feel the rhythm
N you'll groove
Dance up to the planet of apes

Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, oo, oo
Ooo, oo, oo, the funky gibbon
(The funky gibbon)
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo the funky gibbon

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo the funky gibbon

Now everybody get ready
To do the funky gibbon
Drop one arms down by your knees
And the other arm
Reach up to the trees

Let your wrist go limp
Like a bad baboon
Get ready to sing
This gibbon's tune

Will you give me an oo
(Ooo)
Will you give me another oo
(Ooo)
And will you give me an oo
(Ooo)
Now put 'em together
What've you got
(Ooo, oo, oo)

Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, oo, oo
Ooo, oo, oo, the funky gibbon
(The funky gibbon)
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo the funky gibbon

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, oo, oo the funky gibbon

He promised to buy me
A bunch of blue gibbons
To tie up my bonny brown

Ooo, oo, the funky gibbon
The funky gibbon
