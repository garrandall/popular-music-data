I've been searchin'
So long
I thought that love
Would never come along
All I could hear
Was those sad songs
But you came along
And now they're gone


No sad songs for me
Now that I know what love can be
You put a lovin'
That used to be great
Honey, I love you
For eternally




I knew someday I'd find
Love, joy, peace of mind
God bless the day, baby
You took those sad songs away

I feel so good
Down inside
Feel like a man
Man with pride
I've been searching
So long
I thought that love
Would never come along
Now I'm delivered
From sad songs
You came along
And now they're gone
And I'm glad
I'm glad
I got your love, baby
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad...
