Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
I've been watching you


At night
I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong gonna give my all to you


Every day I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my man (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need you, I want you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out
Every weekend
Just to see my boo again


At night
I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong gonna give my all to you


These feelings I have for you
Can go deeper if you can come
Correct with your game boy (No, no)
No, you can't be lame, boy
But if you can please me
Then my love will come easy
I'll do anything you want
Freak me, boy
I'm thinking of you


At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you


Boy you've got all I need
From what I see
And boy every night I am constantly thinking of you


At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovein' strong, gonna give my all to you
