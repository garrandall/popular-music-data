Muffin warm and basket brown
Smiling faces gathered round our dinner table
Close together, hand in hand

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

Find in favor with your neighbor
Well, it can be so fine
It's easier than pie to be kind
We've been searching for so long
Now our house has turned into a home

'Cause I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

'Cause I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

Well, our door is always open
And there's surely room for more
Cooking where there's good love
Is never any chore
So come and get to know us
There'll be a place set just for you
Sweet wine before dinner
That is surely bound to soothe

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love
