Rock steady, baby!
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
And while you're moving
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby


Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is is I might be doing
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh!
(Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)


Rock steady — rock steady, baby
Rock steady — rock steady, baby


Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
While you're moving rock steady
Rock steady


Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is is I might be doing
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh!
(Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)


Rock steady, baby
Rock steady ... woo!
Rock steady

(Rock... steady!... rock... steady!)


(What it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is is I might be doing
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh!
(Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)


Rock steady
Steady, baby!
Rock...rock steady, baby
Baby
(What it is)
Baby baby
(What it is)
Baby
(What it is)
Baby...
