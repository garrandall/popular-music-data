Rock steady baby!
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is

Step n' move your hips
With a feelin' from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
And while you're movin'
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)

It's a funky and low down feelin'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)

What it is
Is I might be do in'
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Let me hear ya gotta feelin' in the air)
Oh!
(Gotta a feelin' an ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady....... rock steady baby.
Rock steady....... rock steady baby

Oooooooooooooh
(Wave your hands up in the air)
Oooooooooooooh
(Got a feelin'an ain't got a care)
Oooooooooooooh
(What fun to take this ride)
Oooooooooooooh
(Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady
Steady it baby!
Rock....rock steady baby
