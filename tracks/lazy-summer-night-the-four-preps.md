It's such a lazy summer night
There's not a moving thing in sight
It's all so quiet
No riot
Why even in the thicket
Mr. Cricket's slowing down

It's such a lazy summer night
And inspiration point is right
For fancy dreamin'
And schemin'
To just relax and run away from town

Hey take a look at all those other cars
They're parked here just like ours
To count the stars above
It seems we're not alone
I guess I should have known
Romance runs high
The last two weeks in July

It's such a lazy summer night
Tonight the fireflies will light
The way for lovers
For lovers like us
To love

It's such a lazy summer night
