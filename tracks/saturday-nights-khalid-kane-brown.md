Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse


I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see


All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do


Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends


I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see


All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do


(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
'Cause I care (I care), I care about you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here around you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
I care (I care), care about you (Care about you)
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be


With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do, I do, oh (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
