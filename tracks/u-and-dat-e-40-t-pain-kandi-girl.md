Girl, I'm a call ya (Call ya)
Later on tonight or tomorrow ('Morrow), now follow
What you gonna do, with this baller
What you gonna do, with this baller


What you gonna do when I bend the block (Bend the block)
Pull up on that ass in a brand new drop (Brand new drop)
Speakers on blast with tremendous knock ('Mendous knock)
TV's in the dash, rims just won't stop
You need to be down with a pimp like me
I ain't turning down nothing but my collar, you see

Cuz I'm a baller, can't nobody hustle harder than me, oh

Oh, your ass is right
I ain't tryna let that pass me tonight
I'ma put my bid in and tell you something slick
Whisper in your ear while I'm holding my dick
I don't mean no harm, it's the hood in me (Hood in me)
Sipping on that Richard Hennessy (Hennessy)
Psychedelic colors in my jewelry (Jewelry)
Suckers hella jealous cuz you digging me, oh
Now what you gonna do mama
I'm tryna dip later on, me and you mama
Like the way that you groove and you move mama
You know the women love me, I'm the 40 boy (40 boy)
Popping my P's cuz I'm laced with game
Nathen but the Yay flowing through my vein
She wear Miss Sixty, can't fit in the Gucci
Cuz her ass big enough to sit a cup on her booty (Goodness!)


Girl, I been shaking, sticking and moving tryna to get you and that booty
Tryna get to you and that booty
Tryna get to you and that booty
Girl, I been shaking and acting a donkey tryna to get you and that monkey
Tryna to get you and that monkey

But my ass in these jeans got you shook, and (Shook, and)
I don't think you know what to do with this pussy

Tryna chase me through the club for this good shit (Good shit)
But I don't think you can handle, this pussy
What you gonna do, with this pussy


You looking like you got that good gooshy, gooshy
Fucking round with me, I beat the brakes off that pussy
Have your ass cumming like a porn star movie
Tell your friends and I bet they all wanna do me
Hoes know me, I'm E-Fo-Oh (E-Fo-Oh)
They recognize pimping when I step in the door (Step in the door)
Higher than a satellite full of that dro (Full of that dro)
Holla at a playa when you ready to go, oh

Tryna get to you and that booty
Tryna get to you and that booty
Girl, I been shaking and acting a donkey tryna to get you and that monkey
Tryna to get you and that monkey
