Come on, baby, let's sit down
We've been dancing all night long
Come on, baby (come on, baby)
Get close to me
We never danced to a love song (love song, love song)
Disco music (disco music) is fine sometimes, yes it is
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)

I love music (I love music) no matter what the style
Ooh, I wanna get close to you, baby
For just a little while
And ooh, ooh, baby (come on, come closer, come on, come closer)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

The party's almost over
Ooh, it won't be long
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
Cut the lights down low
Ooh, it's almost time to go
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)

What a lovely way
Ooh, what a lovely way to end the night
When I hold...when I hold my baby ever so tight, well, well
Hey... you...

Please Mr. DJ, slow the music down (I wanna dance)
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
I wanna feel...(I wanna feel it)
Ooh, I wanna feel your body next to mine
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
Come on and just dance, dance, dance, dance
Come on, come on and dance with me, girl, yeah (I wanna dance)
You know I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
You got to dance, dance, dance, dance
Come on, come on and dance with me, girl
You know I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
Come on, baby, get real close to me (I wanna dance)
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
I wanna feel...
Ooh, I wanna feel your body next to mine
You know I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song) hey
I wanna feel...(feel it, feel it)
You know I wanna feel your body next to mine
I wanna dance to a love song (love song, love song)
You got to dance, dance, dance, dance
Come on, come on an dance with me...
