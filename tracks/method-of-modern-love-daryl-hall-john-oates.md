M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

In the moonlight, under starlight
Songs old as the night
Are what I've been dreaming of

Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in the modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff

I believe love will always be the same (love)
The ways and means are the parts subject to change

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

I can call you, got your number
Share my life with you
A thousand miles away

If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face

Style is timeless
They say fashion's only now (lo-lo-love)
We've got the ways
No one needs to show us how

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

(Method of, method of)
(Method of, method of)
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
(Love, love, love)
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
(Love, love)

It's a modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
What we've got is a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
(It's a method of)

It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
(We know what we're doing, don't we)
We know what we're doing, don't we
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
In the moonlight, in the starlight
Songs old as night
Oh, what are we dreaming of?
(It's a method of)
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

Dreams are made of a different stuff
Emanating in a method of modern love
Present tense, past time behind
Don't fall for the same old line

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
Don't you know that
It's a method of love

I got the way with words
I got a way with rhyme
I do believe that I'm inclined
To look ahead and not behind

I got the method, baby
And it's right on time
It's the method of modern love

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
