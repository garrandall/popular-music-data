Mom's not home tonight
So we can roll around, have a pillow fight
Like a major rager, OMFG (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's all slumber party
Like a fat kid on a pack of Smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me
It's time for spin the bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me
Let's play truth or dare now
We can roll around in our underwear
How every silly kitty should be


Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me


Ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly


Wake up, got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see (oh, woah, woah, woah)
Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with kitty and me


Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me


Ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly

Meow!


Ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly


Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me


Hello kitty, hello kitty
