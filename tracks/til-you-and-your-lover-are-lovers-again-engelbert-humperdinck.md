I see your hand with no wedding band
But I can still see where it's been
I see your heart all broken apart
Wonderin' if he'll ever love you again

Well, I'm just like you, not much I can do
But listen to you while you're here
I'm almost afraid of talkin' this way
But tonight you need someone who cares

'Til you and your lover are lovers again
All that you really need is a friend
Who's lonely like you, someone to fill in
'Til you and your lover are lovers again

So go on and cry, you're gonna get by
I've already been where you are
You don't have to leave, I know what you need
If you let me take you that far

'Til you and your lover are lovers again
All that you really need is a friend
Who's lonely like you, someone to fill in
'Til you and your lover are lovers again

If you should ever go back to his arms
I hope that he keeps your heart safe and warm
You know where I'll be if you ever need
A shoulder to lie on again

'Til you and your lover are lovers again
All that you really need is a friend
Who's lonely like you, someone to fill in
'Til you and your lover are lovers

'Til you and your lover are lovers again
All that you really need is a friend
Who's lonely like you, someone to fill in
'Til you and your lover are lovers again
