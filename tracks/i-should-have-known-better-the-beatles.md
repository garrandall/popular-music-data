I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do


Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see


That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too


So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see


That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too


You love me too, you love me too
You love me too
