Kinda young, very pretty
Living alone, full of fear
Feeling lost, so unhappy
Waiting for luck to appear

Meet a man, sit together,
Talk about dreams, a career
Feeling good, getting closer
Putting her lips to his ear

She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me
Make all those bad dreams disappear
She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me
I'd feel safe for just a minute
Help me drive away my fear

Shattered dreams
Her ambitions slip from her mind
Drift away so secure
Living his life
Pushing the world, far away

She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me
Make all those bad dreams disappear
She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me 
I'd feel safe for just a minute
Help me drive away my fear
