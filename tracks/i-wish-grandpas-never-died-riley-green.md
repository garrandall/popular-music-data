I wish girls you love never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learn to say "sir" and "ma'am", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never ran out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinking kids never got caught
I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honkytonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

I wish Sundays on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
I wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything
Kiss in a Chevrolet, could happen every day

I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinking kids never got caught
I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honkytonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died
Never died

And I wish good dogs never got grey and old
I wish farms never got sold

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinking kids never got caught
I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honkytonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died
I wish grandpas never died
