Ayo, I wanna talk
I wanna call you and talk, I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I stop my vehicle, drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
That's all I want, other than air, other than air
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want for me, I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

What do you need? Do you need bread?
Do you need this? Do you need a hug?
Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, to you I'm Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self control
I am starting to wonder, is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me (Did I wait too long? Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I'm lonely
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know
I'm your puppet, you control me (Did I wait too long?)

Lost son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
A to B, doin' something that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm 'ona take a breather
CorazÃ³n, not just nothin' I'ma take the plea
You're an odyssey

Breathe on a song
Breathe on a song
Breathe on a song

(But at some point you come to your senses)
