Gotta have you near all the time, with your dreams wrapped up in mine
Gotta be a part of your soul and your heart all the time
Nothing in the world that I do means a thing without you
I'm just half alive in my struggle to survive without you
You are my way of life, the only way I know, you are my way of life
I'll never let you go, never let you out of my sight, be it day, be it night
You belong to me, that's the way it will, be wrong or right
I don't need crowds at my door, the applause from the floor
All I need is you and the love we once knew, nothing more
You are my way of life, the only way I know, make me your way of life
