Jane, you say it's all over for you and me, girl
There's a time for love and a time for letting it be, baby 
Jane you're playing a game called, hard to get by its real name 
Making believe that you just don't feel the same
Oh Jane
That's a game on me

Jane, you're playing a game you never can win, girl 
You're staying away just so I'll ask you where you've been, baby 
Like a cat and a mouse (cat and a mouse) 
From door to door and house to house 
Don't you pretend you don't know what I'm talking about 

Were all those nights we spent together, hey hey
Only because you didn't know better
I gotta know
Jane you're playing a game, you're playing a game, playing a game

Oh Jane, you're playing a game of hide and go seek 
Jane, you're playing for fun but I play for keeps, yes I do
(Jane, Jane, Jane) That's a game on me baby 
(Jane, Jane, Jane) So plain to see girl
(Jane, Jane, Jane) Janey, Janey, Janey, Janey, Janey
(Jane, Jane, Jane) Why you fooling with me, me, me oh
(Jane, Jane, Jane) 
(Jane, Jane, Jane) 
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
