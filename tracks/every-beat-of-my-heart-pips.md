Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour

And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
