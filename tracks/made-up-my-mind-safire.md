I still remember when I was young
Someone always had me under their thumb
But now I`m breaking free
A feeling inside of me

It's my decision
I`m taking control
My intuition is letting me know

It's time to put myself first on the list
I wanna give all I have to give
Gonna live like I wanna live
I`m taking chances
I`ve never taken before


I made up my mind
Stop wasting time
I do what I want
I live on the line

No stopping now
Gonna take what`s mine
I draw the line
Made up my mind


Gotta do what`s best for me
Cause no one`s gonna get the best of me
Every step I take
Every move I make

When the walls were tumbling down
I was the only one who was around
That`s when I started believing in me

I wanna give all I have to give
Gonna live
Like I wanna live
I`m taking chances
I`ve never taken before



Baby, I`m gonna stop you
Never ever gonna let you go
I`m gonna make you mine
I don`t want you, baby
Baby, I`m gonna stop you

Baby, I want to let you know
It won`t work this time
I need you, baby
