Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living


We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
The stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine


Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living


Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world


Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living


Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever


And they know just we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight


Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever


And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
But the stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
