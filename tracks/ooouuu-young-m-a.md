Yo, bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy gettin' to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club, man
OOOUUU


Yeah they hate but they broke though (But they broke though)
And when it's time to pop they a no-show (Where they at?)
Yeah, I'm pretty but I'm loco (Yeah, I'm loco)
The loud got me movin' slow-mo
Ayo, Tweetie, where the hoes, bro? (Where the hoes, bro?)
Ayo, Keys, where the hoes though? (Yo, where the hoes though?)
That other nigga, he a bozo (He a bozo)
It's M.A, you don't know ho? (You don't know ho?)
We got liquor by the boatload (That Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe, that's a no-no (That's a no-no)
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code (That's the bro code)
Baby gave me head, that's a low blow (That's a low blow)
Damn, she make me weak when she deep throat (When she deep throat)
I need a rich bitch, not a cheap ho (Not a cheap ho)
They be on that hate shit, I peep though (Yeah, I peep though)
My brother told me, "Fuck 'em, get that money sis!" (Yo, fuck 'em)
You just keep on grindin' on your hungry shit (Uh-huh)
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit (Ignore the funny shit)
'Cause if a nigga violate we got a hunnit clips (Grrrrrrrah)
And we go zero to a hundred quick (Oh)
We just them niggas you ain't fuckin' with (oh, no)
Pockets on a chubby chick (uh)
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooouuu)
Yerr, Eli, why they testin' me? (yo, why they, uh)
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me (like I don't keep that hammer)
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me (like I ain't got a hitter)
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame (oh
If that's your chick then why she textin' me? (yo, why she textin')
Why she keep callin' my phone speakin' sexually? (speakin' oh
Every time I'm out, why she stressin' me? (yo, why she stressin')
You call her Stephanie? (you call her huh?) I call her Headphanie (ooouuu)
I don't open doors for a whore (no no no)
I just want the neck, nothin' more (no nothing more)
Shawty, make it clap, make it applaud (yea, make it clap)
When you tired of your man, give me a call (give me a call)
Dyke bitches talkin' out they jaw (yo, what you say?)
Next minute, callin' for the law (ohooh
This 9 will have 'em callin' for the Lord (grrrrrrrah)
They ain't gettin' shmoney so they bored (man, they bored)
I could never lose, what you thought? (man, what you thought?)
M.A got it on lock, man, of course (man, of course)
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce (I got the sauce)
These haters on my body, shake 'em off (I shake 'em off)
Pussy, I'm a bully and a boss (man, I'm a boss)
I'm killin' 'em, sorry for your loss (R.I.P.)
I just caught a body, Randy Moss (Ra- oh)
Now this year I'm really goin' off (I'm goin' off)


OOOUUU, OOOUUU

OOOUUU, OOOUUU
