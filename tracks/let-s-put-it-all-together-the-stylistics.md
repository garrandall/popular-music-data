Your arms around me are tender and warm
My arms are meant to hold you
Your arms and my arms
What more is there to say

Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Girl, cause lovin' is there is

Your lips can thrill me just touching my cheek
My lips are meant to kiss you
Your lips and my lips
What more is there to say

Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Girl, cause lovin' is there is

Love like this never happened before
Perfect and true
Day by day we been feeling it more
You love me (You love me) and I love you

Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Lets put it all together
Girl
