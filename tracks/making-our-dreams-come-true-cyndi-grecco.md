We're gonna make it

Give us any chance we'll take it
Read us any rule we'll break it
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doing it our way
Nothing's gonna to turn us back now
Straight ahead and on the track now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doing it our way

There is nothing we won't try
Never heard the word "impossible"
This time there's no stopping us
We're gonna make it

On your mark, get set, and go now
Got a dream and we must know now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
And we'll do it our way, yes our way
Make all our dreams come true
And we'll do it our way, yes our way
Make all our dreams come true for me and you

For me and you

Nothing's gonna turn us back now
Straight ahead and on the track now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doing it our way

There is nothing we won't try
Never heard the word "impossible"
This time there's no stopping us
We're gonna make it

On your mark, get set, and go now
Got a dream and we must know now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
And we'll do it our way, yes our way
Make all our dreams come true
And we'll do it our way, yes our way
Make all our dreams come true for me and you
