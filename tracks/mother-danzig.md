Mother
Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words
What they mean
What they say
Mother

Mother
Can you keep them in the dark for life
Can you hide them from the waiting world
Oh mother

Father
Gonna take you daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh father

Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding

Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's

Mother
Tell your children not to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand
Oh mother

Father
Do you wanna bang heads with me
Do you wanna feel everything
Oh father

Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding

Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Yea

Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding

Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Wo-oh
Mother
Yea
