I love when you pulling up in your Jeep, bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on, just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets, but when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing, no, oh


Baby hop in my ride, oh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow, oh, take your time


Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Everyday, everyday


And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh, yeah
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly (oh, oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (oh)
On repeat and it won't stop, boom, boom, oh


I love when we pulling up to that beach (that beach)
Sand down in my feet (yeah)
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body (body), rock rock the boat, Aaliyah (body)
Don't it sound familiar?


And you sound like, uh uh, ayy, ayy
Looking up into space
It's just me and my bae
And we feel so amazing, oh, oh, oh, all night, woah


Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way, yeah)
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh, oh
Everyday, everyday


And it won't stop, no, boom, boom, oh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh, yeah
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly (me, oh)
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh


Everyday, everyday, I can't wait
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity, I love you 'til infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
My everything, my everything
And when I think about it, oh, it be making me weak, baby
I won't ever stop, my heart won't skip a beat, baby
And it'll keep going on, going on, going on


And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh (no, I'm so in love with you, girl)
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh, yeah (boom, oh)
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat (oh)
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh, boom
And it won't stop


Girl I'm, rocking your body
Rock-rocking your body (won't stop)
Rock-rocking your body, baby (won't stop)
Said I'm rocking your body, rocking your body to sleep
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, oh, yeah
