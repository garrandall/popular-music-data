U send me swingin'
Oh, u send me swingin'

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin', u send me swingin'
Oh, u send me swingin'

I never thought I'd really find, someone so beautiful and kind
Oh, what you've done to me, with just the little things you do
You've got me crazy over you, and it's getting stronger
When I'm with you, I fall deeper in love, swingin'
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of, so I

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin'
U send me swingin', oh, u send me swingin'

Just thinking 'bout you, and all those things that we could do, girl
Together as one, yea, if only you could see, how sweet your love
Is to me, so heavenly, knowing the way to say just how I feel for you
Swingin', every day that passes my heart swings closer to you

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin'
U send me swingin', oh, u send me swingin'

Bum bum, chica, bum bum
Swingin' on you, swingin' on you, babe
Chica, bum bum, chica, bum bum
Swingin' on you, swingin' on you

When I'm with you I fall deeper in love
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of, so I

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin'

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin'
U send me swingin', oh, u send me swingin'

Oh, u send me swingin'
U send me swingin', oh, u send me swingin'
