Dis baby doin' everybody say A Bay Bay


A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay


You wanna know what we say in da club (A Bay Bay)
White folks, gangstas, and the thugs (A Bay Bay)
Stuntin with a stacks of dem dubs (A Bay Bay)
Ridin in the lac' with a mug (A Bay Bay)

I'm in da club hollerin
A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay, A Bay Bay
I'm in da club hollerin


Now when I holla A Bay Bay,
I'm finna get my groove on
It's so hot up in da club
That I ain't got no shoes on
Holdin up a big stack of dem honeys
In a rubberband
So don't ask me for no cash
Cause I'm not that other man
Everybody trippin cause I'm limpin when I'm walkin
And I'm pimpin when I'm talkin
I don't trick 'em when I'm talkin
Them boys in the back
They be rollin up they dopey
And they blow until choke
And that's what got his got his game flossin
Wen I see a bad chick I'm hollerin out A Bay Bay
Hope ya'll ain't with your boyfriend
Cause I don't care what they say
And I don't care what he say, or she say
I'm in the DJ both takin pics. with the DJ
You wanna know what we say
When the clubs get crunk (wat) A Bay Bay
Let it play that's my song turn it up (ok)
You wanna know what we say
When the clubs get crunk (wat) A Bay Bay
Let it play that's my song turn it up

Now if you lookin for me baby
You can find me bangin in the chevy
Candy painted swangin 90
Big cars creep with my people right behind me
I showed 'em my chain
And now she hollerin where you findin me
Show my mouth piece to them freaks
Now they hirin me
Oh u gotta fire dem well I hope you ain't tryin me
Throw the car in park then I reach under my seat
Hop out with my hand under my shirt
That's where that 9 be
Yellowbone tryna chirp me
She tryna see where I be
You goin to let me get in your mouth
Well that's where I'm a be
Unpop trunk with lights
That's where the chopper be
Straight to the hotel
All the baddest chicks followin me
I know you like my style
I ain't trippin I'm just tryna see
Girl is you drunk
Well tell me why you leanin on me
And if you thankin I'm a stunt you trippin
I pulled up in an expedition with the roof missin

A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
I'm in the club hot, crunk, sweatin, burnin up
I'm bouncin thru the crowd
Buckin, and hollerin wass up
When I done fell out on the dance floor
And now I can't get up
J's on ya feet but you can't get ease
Loui vaton brown, white, and yellow trick please
I go to Saint Louis and let my chain hang low
Conary yellow diamonds mixed with rows gold
I shine real bright in the light cause I'm a star
8 shots of patron now I'm standin on the bar
Tried to get drunk as a skunk
And put the keys in the wrong car
Prolly got drunk as a skunk
And put the keys in the wrong car



A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up hey
