Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's, you know it is
Every one yes every one
Everybody's sayin' music, music is love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love

Everybody's sayin' that music is love, everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love, everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love, everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love, everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love

Put on your colors and run come see
Everybody's sayin' that music's for free
Take off your clothes and lie in the sun
Everybody's sayin' that music's for fun
