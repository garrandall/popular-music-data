A starlit sky, a moon above
The perfect night to share our love
But darling, where are you

A rendezvous just meant for two
A time and place to say I do
But darling, where are you

Why can't this love of mine be seen?
Or will she always be a dream
And if someday, my dream comes true
Will I have all these little things with you?

Like wedding bells
Bride and groom
We'll have the perfect honeymoon
But darling, where are you

We'll have wedding bells
Bride and groom
We'll have the perfect honeymoon
But darling, where are you
