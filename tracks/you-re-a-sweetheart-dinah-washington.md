You're a sweetheart
If there ever was one
If there ever was one, baby, it's you
Life without you
Was an incomplete dream
You are every sweet dream come true

My search was such a blind one
And I was all at sea
I never thought I'd find one
Quite so perfect for me
You're a sweetheart if there ever was one
If there ever was one, daddy, it's you
