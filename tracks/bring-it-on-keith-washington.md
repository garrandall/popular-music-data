Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on (Bring it on)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on

It's two o'clock in the morning
This is the time when games begin
I feel your body shakin'
'Cause you know just what I'm thinkin'

Let's lie here on the floor
'Cause my bedroom's too far to go
I just wanna get into you
And I'll do anything that you wanna do, just

Bring it on, bring it on (Bring it on)
Bring it on, bring it on , oh, ho
Bring it on, bring it on (Bring it on just)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on

Let me know if this is okay
If my body's movin', movin' the right way

'Cause it feels so good to me
Makin' love to you sets my body free, baby

Your sexy body makes me scream and you're on top so, girl, do your thing

I just wanna satisfy so I'll get on my knees (On my knees)
To know I'm goin down 'cause, girl, I know you like it
So bring it on me

Bring it on, bring it on (I like the things you do)
Bring it on (The way you make your body move), bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on (See I like it baby, I like it, baby)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on (Baby, I like the way you love me)

Bring it on, bring it on (So let the games begin)
Bring it on, bring it on (And we gon' play it till the end)
Bring it on, bring it on (I can feel your body's gettin hot)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on
(So bring it on, just bring it on, girl, bring it on, just bring it on)

Oh...keep it comin' 'cause it feels so good
No one has ever loved me like this
Not even close, never before
Doin' me like I have never been done before

Oh...take your time
Let's make it last all night long
My main concern is just to turn you on, and on
(My main concern is just to turn you on, all night long, yeah)
Bring it on

Bring it on, bring it on (Keep it comin please)
Bring it on, bring it on (I get down on my knees)
Bring it on, bring it on (At your request)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on (Anything you wanna do)

Bring it on, bring it on (I'll close my eyes and leave it up to you)
Bring it on, bring it on (Bring it on, on, on)
Bring it on, bring it on (Just let the games begin)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on (And anyway you wanna work this here body)
