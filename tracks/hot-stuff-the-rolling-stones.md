Hot stuff, hot stuff
Hot stuff, hot stuff
Can't get enough
Hot stuff, hot stuff
Hot stuff, can't get enough
The music is mighty, mighty fine
Hot stuff
Hot stuff, can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Hot stuff, can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Hot stuff, can't get enough
The music is mighty, mighty fine
Hot stuff

Hot stuff, can't get enough
Hot stuff, play it rough, yeah
I gave you love
Because music is want I want
To keep my body always moving
Yeah, shake it up, hot stuff
Every day, I get another dose
I can't stand it when the music stops
Hot stuff
Everybody out on the dance floor
You know what I'm talking about
Music make you forget all your trouble
Make you sing and make you tell the whole wide world
So what? Hot stuff
Hot stuff, shake it up, shake it up
I want to tell all my friends in London
There ain't nothing wrong with you
But you'd better shape up
Shake it up, you're hot stuff
All the people in New York City
I know you're all going broke
But I know you're tough, yeah, you're hot stuff
Hot stuff
To everybody in Jamaica
That is working in the sun
You're hot, you're hot stuff
Shake it up, shake it up, hot stuff, hot stuff
Hot stuff, shake it up, hot stuff
