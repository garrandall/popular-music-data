See those trees
Bend in the wind
I feel they've got a lot more sense than me
You see I try to resist

A rubberband bouncing back to life
A rubberband bend the beat
If I could learn to give like a rubberband
I'd be back on my feet
A rubberband hold me trousers up
A rubberband ponytails
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband
I'd be a rubberband girl
A rubberband girl me
A rubberband girl me
Oh I wanna be a rubberband girl

When I slip out
Of my catapult
I gotta land with my feet firm on the ground
And let my body catch up

A rubberband bouncing back to life
A rubberband bend the heat
If I could learn to give like a rubberband
I'd be back on my feet
A rubberband hold me trousers up
A rubberband ponytails
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband
I'd be a rubberband girl
A rubberband girl me
A rubberband girl me
Oh I wanna be a rubberband girl

Give like a rubberband
Twang like a rubberband
Snap like a rubberband

Rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub

One rubberband won't keep you up
Two rubberbands won't keep you up
Three rubberbands won't keep you up
Here I go......
.... Yeah!

One rubberband won't keep you up
Two rubberbands won't keep you up
Three rubberbands won't keep you up
