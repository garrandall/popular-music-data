I've got a new age girl (Tell us what she's like)
An environmentalist girl (Does she ride a bike?)
She has a crystal necklace (Does she spend a lot of cash?)
Though her vibes are rather reckless (She's heading for a crash)
Oh her flowing skirt is blowing in a transcendental wind
And she wonders without knowing where did we begin


Mary Moon, she's a vegetarian
(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon will outlive all the septuagenarians
(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Oh she loves me so, she hates to be alone
She don't eat meat but she sure like the bone


You know she drives wind car (How does she like it?)
It doesn't get her far (Why she doesn't bike it?)
But it gets her to where she's going
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Where that is wish I knew
I don't know where she's going
And I don't know where she's been
All I know that lovin' her has gotta be a sin

Mary Moon, will you hesitate?
Don't segregate your thoughts from your emotions
(Mary Moon)
I know devotion isn't way up there



Mary Moon (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Oh, Mary Moon (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)

She's the one for me, me oh (Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
