A run around man
A do you wrong man
He'll do you wrong
And tell you he cares

This is a crazy man
A walking around in a daze man
You'll call his job
But he's not there no no

But you love him
And do anything
To keep him
No matter how strange

This is a woman's way
This is a woman's way
If you love him
And need your man
The way that I need mine

You'll cook his supper
And then you'll fix his plate
He'll find complaints about something
Yes he will

And after supper
You'll hold his hand tight
You know what he'll do
He'll look you straight in the eye and say
Honey, club meets tonight

He's just telling another lie to you

But you love him
And do anything
To keep him
No matter how strange, because

This is a woman's way
This is a woman's way
If you love him
And need your man
The way that I need mine

Well, I've got to go now
But listen ladies, I want you to take heed to what I say
Because if you fool around and lose that man
Believe me you're going to be a hurting woman
Because someone is always out there waiting on him
They're just waiting on him
Somebody's found a pile of trouble
Get him back on the double
Go ahead keep him around
Because I'm keeping mine

This is a woman's way
This is, this is, this is, a woman's way, a woman's way
I can't help it
Because this is a woman's way
