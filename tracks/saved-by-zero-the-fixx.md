Maybe someday
Saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer
Thoughts that leave me
Chasing after
My dreams disown me
Loaded with danger

So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

Holding on to
Words that teach me
I will conquer
Space around me

So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Who needs to win (saved by zero)

Saved by zero
