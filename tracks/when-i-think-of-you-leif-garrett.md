When I think of you
I think of sunny days in June
Warm, nice and tender
The sun in your heart

When I think of you
I think of dancin' in the street
Feelin' every beat
Of the good summer fun

Summer's ending
When he left
You left too
Now there's nothing to do
But wait for the summer
Wait for the summer
And you

When I think of you
I remember when the kissed
The radio was playin' a song for two

When I think of you
I think of running on the beach
Passing through the heat
And the sand on our feet

I gotta wait for the summer and you
