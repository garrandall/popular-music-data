Hey!

Oh see, what you have done now
Oh see, see see rider
I said see, what you have done now
Ah you made me love you
Now, now, now your man has gone

Oh, I'm going with my baby
And I won't be back til fall yeah
Oh, I'm going with my baby
And I won't be back til fall yeah
And if I find me a new girl,
I won't be back at all

Ah Jenny Jenny Jenny
Won't you come along with me
(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Jenny Jenny Jenny

(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)

Spinnin', spinnin' spinnin'
Spinnin' like a spinnin' top
(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Spinnin', spinnin' spinnin'
Spinnin' like a spinnin' top
(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Come along baby (feelin' love?)

Whoo

Oh see, what you have done now
Oh see, see see rider
Ah come on see, what you have done now
Ah you made me love you
Now,now,now,now your man has gone

Ah Jenny Jenny Jenny

(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Jenny Jenny Jenny

(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Come along girl

Spin spin spinnin' like a spinnin' top
(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
Spin spin spinnin' like a spinnin' top
(Jenny Jenny whoo Jenny Jenny)
