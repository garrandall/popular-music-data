(oo)...don't wanna try don't wanna try (try try)
(oo)..don't wanna try no more
(oo)..don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try


i can't believe u had the nerve to say the things u said
they hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
i can't believe it ..4 years gone down the drain
oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
i try'd to save it so many times but you still couldn't see
u kept insistin' and resistin' that u would not fall again
and now ur tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
and ur tryin' to come back home
ur tellin' me u really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
but baby i


don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
u keep insisting when u know our love is out the door
don't wanna try don't wanna try cuz all we do is fight and say the things
that hurt so bad to where we both begin to cry
don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough its been a rough road
baby just let it go
don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
tell me whats the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love


u and I had many conversations on the telephone
talks about one day we having a place of our own
wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
but all of that just seems so far away from me
had to wake up face reality
it all just seem to good to be true after all you put me through
and now ur tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
and ur tryin' to come back home
u tellin' me that u really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
but baby i


don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
u keep insisting when u know our love is out the door
don't wanna try don't wanna try cuz all we do is fight and say the things
that hurt so bad to where we both begin to cry
don't wanna try don't wanna try I bout just had enough its been a rough road
baby just let it go
don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
tell me whats the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love


(don't wanna try don't wanna try)
(don't wanna try no more)
(don't wanna try don't wanna try...oo)

(don't wanna try don't wanna try)
(don't wanna try no more)
(don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more oo)
