Gonna drive like hell through your neighborhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank,
Sit on the hood and drink
I'm about to get my pissed off on

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby,
And drove me redneck crazy

Wish I knew how long it's been going on
How long you've been getting some on the side
Nah, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well, he won't be getting any sleep tonight

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby,
And drove me redneck crazy
Redneck crazy

Did you think I'd wish you both the best,
Endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am
Yeah, I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M.

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight,
But I'm up for anything tonight
You've gone and broke the wrong heart, baby,
And drove me redneck crazy
You drove me redneck crazy, oh, yeah.
