Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love


I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my loving to was only a substitute
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms, this ain't where my heart belongs
Sex in the air, no loving here
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishing I could care, girl, I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women, they just can't compare, girl, I know


Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love


Feelings I thought that I would never have
Oh I'm so open and I got it bad
I got you now and I'ma make it last
She says my baby, she can't wait to have
Love in the air, never been so clear
So beautiful, bring your body here
Let me fall into good love
I wanna hear the lovely sound
Let me take my time while we in this bed
You were made for me and I don't wanna share, girl, I know


Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love


Don't you ever leave
Baby girl, I need, need you love to breathe
Never been so clear to me
I was blinded but now I see because


Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't, sex ain't better than love
