Baby, almost died
Baby, almost died
Baby, almost died
Baby, almost died

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you (Baby, almost died)
I turned into the man I used to be
To be (Baby, almost died)
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me (Baby, almost died)
I just wanted to call you and say, and say (Baby, almost died)

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most? (Baby, almost died)
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart (Baby, almost died)
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go (Baby, almost died)
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no (Baby, almost died)
