There's a scandal
In the neighborhood
And it's all about Julie Brown
It seems a long
Lost cousin, Jeremiah
Had lately arrived in town

Now when Julie's fella
Came to call
And saw them kissing

He started home at once

Now Julie said
I'm surprised at you
Don't go acting like a dunce

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
He's a cousin of mine

Now when Julie had
Explained her relationship
He said, honey, that may be so

But this fella don't look
Like a thirty-second cousin
That I met here a week ago

Julie smiled at him
And joined her cousin, sad
And as they slowly walked away

He heard him ask
Who was that fella
And he heard his Julie say

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's just a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
A cousin of mine

Would I fool you, go on
He's a cousin of mine
