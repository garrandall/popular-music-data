(Mmm)

(Well, well, well, well, well)

(Yea-yay-yeah)

(Mmm-hmm)

(Verse One)
When did you decide that you were leaving, boy?
(Hey). When did you stop believing
In what we had?
Was it when that girl appeared
Was it when you started acting weird?

(Hook)
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy

(Hmm)

Was it her that made it so easy
For you and I not to scream
Like it used to be?
Is it her that you hold so tight
And so far that you treat so right?

(Hook)
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Boy
(Oh, no-no)

(Chorus)
I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought the sun would touch the sky
But
You being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But
Hey
So long

(Verse Two)
I thought that this would drive me so crazy
Your changing ways just still amaze me
From this too
One day you love me so
The next day you're telling me 'No.'

(Hook)
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy
(Mmm)

I must admit you had me crying
Feeling betrayed by your lying
Telling me those things
Saying you'd be home at two
Whilst she's out there with you

(Hook)
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy
(Oh, no-no
No-no)

(Chorus)
I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought the sun would touch the sky
But
You being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But
Hey
So long

(Bridge)
I know one day
(I know one day)
You'd come back begging
Baby
(You'd come back begging baby)
Remember I said
(Remember I said
'So long'?)
'So long'?

(Hook)
You did me wrong
(you did me wrong, baby)
And you will never hurt me again
'Cause I

(Chorus)
I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
(I never thought they would be dry)
I never thought (thought I''d see the sun)
The sun would touch the sky
But
You being gone only showed me that I'm strong
(Hey)
It hurt me
But
Hey
So long

(Chorus)
I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
(Mhhm. Ain't never)
I never (ooh) thought the sun would touch the sky
But
You being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But
Hey
So long

(Chorus)
I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
(Never be dry, no)
I never thought (never be dry) the sun would touch the sky
