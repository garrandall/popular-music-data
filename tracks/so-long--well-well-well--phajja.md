When did you decide that you were leaving, boy?
Hey, when did you stop believing
In what we had?
Was it when that girl appeared
Was it when you started acting weird?

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy

Was it her that made it so easy
For you and I not to scream
Like it used to be?
Is it her that you hold so tight
And so far that you treat so right?

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy
(Oh, no-no)

I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought thought I'd see the sun
The sun would touch the sky
But you being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But hey
So long

I thought that this would drive me so crazy
Your changing ways just still amaze me
From this too
One day you love me so
The next day you're telling me no

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy
(Mmm)

I must admit you had me crying
Feeling betrayed by your lying
Telling me those things
Saying you'd be home at two
Whilst she's out there with you

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, boy
(Oh, no-no, no-no)

I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought thought I'd see the sun
The sun would touch the sky
But you being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But hey
So long

I know one day
You'd come back begging, baby
Remember I said so long?

You did me wrong
You did me wrong, baby
And you will never hurt me again
'Cause I

I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought thought I'd see the sun
The sun would touch the sky
But you being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But hey
So long

I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
I never thought the sun would touch the sky
But you being gone only showed me that I'm strong
It hurt me
But hey
So long

I never thought my eyes would ever be dry
(Never be dry, no)
I never thought the sun would touch the sky
