Oh, oh, anytime that you want me
Oh, oh, anytime that you need me


Oh, oh, anytime that you want me to
Oh, oh, anytime that you need me


I'm standing here with my arms a mile wide
Hoping and praying for you
Listen to me and enlighten me, yeah
I hope that you need me too, 'cause


Oh, oh, anytime that you want me
Oh, oh, anytime that you need me


Give me all of your sunshine
A spark is all I need
To take it away, all of the shadows
Well, what more can I say, yeah, yeah


Oh, anytime at all
Anytime at all
Anytime at all


Oh, oh, anytime that you want me
Oh, oh, anytime that you need me


Oh, oh, anytime that you want me to
Oh, oh, anytime that you want me


Oh, oh, anytime that you need me
Oh, oh, anytime that you want me to
