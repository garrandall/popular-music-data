Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me


Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me


I'm standing here with my arms a mile wide
Hoping and praying for you
Listen to me and enlighten me, yeah
I hope that you need me too, 'cause


Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me


Give me all of your sunshine
A spark is all I need
To take it away, all of the shadows
Well, what more can I say, yeah, yeah


Oh, anytime at all
Anytime at all
Anytime at all


Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me


Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me


Ooh, ooh, anytime that you need me
Ooh, ooh, anytime that you want me to
