(Dave Loggins)
Here it's seven in the am,
It's gonna take more then wakin" to rise me
I wake up with this need again
But feel the love of the woman beside me
It's just one of those days
When I wana lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wana wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

It looks like I'm gonna be late again
And I need to get up and get movin'
And I'm tryin'
But the longer I keep stalling
The more I think about callin' in and lying here
It's just one of those days
When I wana stay here with her
And watch her while she sleeps
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wana wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

Well I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wana wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

With Morning Desire
