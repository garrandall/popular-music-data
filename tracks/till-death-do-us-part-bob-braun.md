One love, one life
One dream forever
One love for one heart
Till death do us part Till death do us part
Do you know what that means
As long as I live there'll
Never be anyone but you And when the time comes
I pray I'll be the first
Because I couldn't live
Without you anyhow Till death do us part
For better or worse
That's only a question
Which asks if I'd stick it out
If the going got rough Well, I only have to
Think how rough it
Would be without you
And I know I could go through
Anything as long as you love me For richer or poorer
Well, that's no problem
If I had all the
Kingdoms of the world
I'd still be poor without you And yet though I'm poor
I'm the richest man in the world
If I have your love Till death do us part
In my arms, in my heart
In my dreams and with
Every breath I take
I think of you For me, you're the reason
Every new day dawns
Because I love you so much
And I always will
Till death do us part One love, one life
One dream forever
One love for one heart
Till death do us part
Till death do us part
