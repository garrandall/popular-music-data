Whatever the world may say
Nothing can change the love
That I give you any time of the day

But if you do believe in love
If you do believe in anything
If you do believe in love
Then you do believe in everthing

If you do believe in
You do believe in love

When you walk the streets on rainy afternoons
Carrying your soul with hate and love
Not believe in anymore, in promses of life
Raise your mind into a space
Then no-one ever fights the promises of life

Whatever the world may say
Nothing can change the love
That I give you any time of the day

But if you do believe in love
If you do believe in anything
If you do believe in love
Then you do believe in everthing

Lonely hours of the night crawling by
While you are waiting for the morning dawn
They seem to slip away and no one is in touch
There's always someone at your side
Who wants to carry as much
Who wants to carry as much

Whatever the world may say
Nothing can change the love
That I give you any time of the day

But keep it in, keep it in your head
And love me the way
Do it today like you loved me yesterday
Keep it in, keep it in your head
And love me the way
Do it today like you loved me yesterday

But if you do believe in love
If you do believe in anything
If you do believe in love
Then you do believe in everthing

If you do believe in love
You do believe in love

But if you do believe in love
If you do believe in anything
If you do believe in love
Then you do believe in everthing

If you do believe in love
You do believe in love
