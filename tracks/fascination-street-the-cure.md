Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in


Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout


And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street


So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street


Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
