Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated

Wish I knew then what I know now, but, I, I
Canât change the past no matter how I try, I
So Iâma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like thereâs nobody around
Even gravity canât keep me down

Everybody get it started
Iâm on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Iâm undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now Iâm walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Iâm undefeated, undefeated, tonight

Undefeated

No looking back canât live that way, right now, ow
Yesterdayâs gone, Iâve found my way somehow, ow
So Iâma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like thereâs nobody around
Even gravity canât keep me down

Everybody get it started
Iâm on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Iâm undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now Iâm walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Iâm undefeated, undefeated, tonight

So Iâll live today like itâs my last one
Thereâs no time for fear, you only live once

Everybody get it started
Iâm on top of the world, what a feeling
Everybody say
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Please believe it, Iâm undefeated
No one told me what I could be
Now Iâm walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Iâm undefeated, undefeated, tonight

What a feeling (yeah)
To be undefeated
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated, tonight
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Undefeated
