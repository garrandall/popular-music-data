Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothing
Got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
This is God's country

We pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in a plate, I guess that's why they call it
God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again 'cause we're proud to be
From God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

(Yeah, this is God's country)
(This is God's country) God's country

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time lay me six feet deep in
God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
