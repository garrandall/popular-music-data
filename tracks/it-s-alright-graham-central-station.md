Your love Means so much to me girl
And your kiss, oh baby Means so much to me
Your touch, your touch Your tender touch

Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
More and more and more and more and more

If my love, if my love Means so much to you
Then why, then why Then why love
Do you do the things you do
And my kiss

Everytime you leave I leave you wanting
Everytime you leave I leave you wanting
Everytime you leave I leave you wanting
More and more and more and more and more

I'm talking bout Your love, love, love, love, love
And what it means to me Your love, your love, your tender love
And what it means to me And your kiss, your kiss, your kiss

Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
Everytime you leave You leave me wanting
More and more and more and more
