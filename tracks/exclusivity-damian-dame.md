Completely for you

Exclusivity
You mean the world to me
And I refuse to be without your love

Yeah, me for you
And baby, you for me
Yes, I was meant to be your baby girl

Yo, girl, when I fall in love
Boy, I fall in love
You will be the only one
If you believe in love
Like I believe in love, baby
Boy, I want you
I want you

And when I feel the need
Boy, I feel the need
You will be the only one for me
I will be relieved that
You will be with me, baby
Say, hey yo

All I want from you
Is what you want from me
Exclusivity
And what you want from me
Is what I want from you
Baby, exclusivity

I want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want
Yeah, I want, I want, I want, I want

I want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want

Oh, baby, it's fantasy
I want you back of me exclusively
Gonna get it
What you want it

Where you want it
Where you need it
Yes, baby, you will be relieved

We should be together like body and soul
Loving one another, baby
Never let go
Can you tell me you'll be with it
Say, hey yo, hey

Ooh, baby boy
I'm the woman you need
I can give you loving exclusively
Don't you know
I'll whack it to you night and day
Whack you â€˜til you're silly
Got nothing to say

Baby, if you promise not to dog me out
I can give you nookie you know nothing about
Boy, give me a minute and I'm good to go
Say, hey yo
Hey

All I want from you
Is what you want from me
Exclusivity
And what you want from me
Is what I want from you
Baby, exclusivity

Exclusivity
You exclusively
Exclusivity
You exclusively
Exclusivity
You exclusively

All I want from you
Is what you want from me
Exclusivity
And what you want from me
Is what I want from you
Baby, exclusivity
