I will always think about you
Even if I live without you
Please don't let that ever happen
I have too much love within me

For you (for you)
Baby it's true (for you)
Baby

I can't find the words to tell you
Just how much I really love you
If you feel that same way I do
You will know the love I have here

For you (for you)
Baby it's true (for you)
Baby

The days we spent together were fine
The nights, the lights, were yours and mine
It's true
I'll always love you. Always love you

So let us plan our futures together
Love is here. It's getting stronger
Even if I live without you
I will always think about you

It's true (for you)
Baby it's you (for you)
Baby it's true (for you)
Baby for you (for you)
Baby
