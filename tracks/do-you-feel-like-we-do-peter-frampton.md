Woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine, what wine, where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on - you wanna do it again?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
My friend got busted just the other day
They said don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
He drove into a taxi bent the boot hit the back
Had to play some music otherwise he'd crack
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?

Champagne for breakfast and a sherman in my hand
***** top, ***** tails - never fails
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on - you wanna do it again?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?



Well, woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand.
Whose wine? What wine? Where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been.
Come on, let's do it again.

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I do?

My friend got busted, just the other day.
They said,"Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away."
Drove him to a taxi, bent the boot, hid the bag.
Had to play some music, Otherwize he'd crack

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I...



Do you...you, feel like I do?
Yes ya do.
Do you...you, feel like I do?

Champagne for breakfast and a Sherman in my hand.
Peached up, Peached Ale, never fails.
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been.
Come on, let's do it again.

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I...



"Bob Mayo, on the keyboards. Bob Mayo"

Do you feel like we do?
Do you feel like we do?
Oh, that's true.
Do you feel like we do?
Get back.
Do you feel..do you feel like we do?





Oh baby do you feel?
Oh baby do you feel, feel like we do?
Do you feel...do you feel...like we do?
I want to thank you.
Do you feel like we do?
That's alright, that's alright to feel you'd like,
Feel you'd like, a good time.
We'll go to bed and good night.
Good time, good time, good time, good time, good time.
