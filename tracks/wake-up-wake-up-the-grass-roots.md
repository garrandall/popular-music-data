Open up your eyes and wake up
Got a lot of time to make up, girl
Time goes by in such a hurry
Why'd you sit around and worry so, don't you know
You've been living your life in a shell
Now's the time has come to break the spell

Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up

Life is just a book of pages
And you still got so many to fill in
Don't put down what's happenin' around you
Just because they told you it's a sin
How do you know until you try
Love is callin' so spread your wings and fly

Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up

Got so many things to show you
Groovy things that we can share together
Baby, no no no don't be afraid of tomorrow
La la la la

Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up baby
