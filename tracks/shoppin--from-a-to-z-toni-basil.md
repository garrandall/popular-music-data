Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping from A to Z
Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping

Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping from A to Z
Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping

I went shopping
With a list from A to Z
Everything I needed
For a happy family

Walked through the doors
Give the box boy a smile
Grabbed a silver buggy
And I boogied down the aisle

I got A (apple) B (banana)
C (chili) d (dog food)

Snapped up the frozen food
Chicken pot pie
Rolling through the produce
That's a better buy

Satisfied the munchies
With an open bag of chips
Lady with the samples says
Try it with this dip

It's good with E (eggplant)
F (fish) G (garlic) H (hairspray)
I (ice) J (junk food)
K (ketchup) L (liver)

Go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping

Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping from A to Z
Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping

Standing in the line and
The checker said to me
If you wanna cash a check
I need two pieces of ID

Someone stole my coupons
So I said, forget the flour
They copied down my number
Said, I'll call you in an hour

M (matzoh) N (nuts)
O (onion) P (pizza)
Q (quiche) R (relish)
S (soap) T (tuna)

I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping

U (undies) V (veal)
W (wieners) X (nothing)
Y (yams) Z (zippers)

Oh, no, I lost my list
Oh, uh uh, aw
I wonder if I've
Forgotten anything

Oh let's see, what was
A (apple) B (banana) C (chili)
D (dog food) E (eggplant)
F (fish) G (garlic) H (hairspray)
I (ice) J (junkfood) K (ketchup)
L (liver) M (matzoh) N (nuts)
O (onion) P (pizza) Q (qiuche)
R (relish) S (soap) T (tuna)
U (undies) V (veal) W (wieners)
X (nothing) Y (yams) Z (zippers)

I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping

Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping
Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping

I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping from A to Z
I go shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping
