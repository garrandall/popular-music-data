Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind


For my wrongs, I've no excuses
I couldn't blame you if you refused me
Girl, you caught me in my childish games
But I'm a new man, girl, I've changed, oh
I'll be a yo-yo on your finger (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
You can bounce me up and down honey (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
I'll do anything to win you (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
Ah, but don't let me hit the ground, oh, come on


Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready (Oh, I'm ready for you)
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind (Honey, don't change your mind now)
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind


Girl, I know you don't want me back
But what can we gain by that?
If your love is still the same
Don't make me wait in vain, oh
We are losing while we're waiting (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
This love we know so well, honey (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
So why are you hesitating? (Ba-ba, ba-ba)
Why you want to put me through this hell?
Come on honey


Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready (Oh, I'm ready for you honey)
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind (Honey, don't change your mind now)
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
