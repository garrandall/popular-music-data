Wait a minute let me understand
While I'm a-sittin' here holdin' your hand
Your tellin' me about the boy next door
Tellin' me that he can offer you more

What a nerve
What a chase
Better put her in a place

Wait a minute
You know that won't get it
If that's the way your love will be
You might as well forget it

Am I correct in hearin' what you say
That you would rather be with him instead
You said that you could travel with him far
You say he's got a brand new Cadillac car

Well, what you mean?
Is that so?
Better let that woman go

Wait a minute
You know that won't get it
If that's the way your love will be
You might as well forget it

I don't go for all the crazy noise
About you datin' all those other boys
If I'm gonna be your only one
I'm not waitin' till your honey's done

You're a riot
And you're tough
Honey, cut out all that stuff

Wait 'a minute
You know that won't get it
If that's the way your love will be
You might as well forget it

I'm gonna tell you for the very last time
If I'm yours, you better be mine
When I come home about a quarter to four
Don't wanna hear the slammin' of the back door

You're bad
And so wild
Stop a messin' with me, child

Wait a minute
You know that won't get it
If that's the way your love will be
You might as well forget it

You might as well forget it

Why, you can just go on on and forget about
The whole cotton pickin' affair
I get so tired
