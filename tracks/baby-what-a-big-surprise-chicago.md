Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only fakin' it
And like before my heart was takin' it 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes 

Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise 

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise
