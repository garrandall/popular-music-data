Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only faking it
And like before my heart was taking it


Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes


Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way


Now and then just like before
I think about the love I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway
