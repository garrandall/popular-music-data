Found someone who can comfort me but there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane but I just want you to know.

She's the one makes me feel so good when everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down, so I've got something to show.

Staring at empty pages, scented by the same old flowers
Staring at empty pages, flowing along in the ages.

Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard but I've got something to show.

Staring at empty pages, scented by the same old flowers
Staring at empty pages, flowing along in the ages.

Staring at empty pages, scented by the same old flowers
Staring at empty pages, flowing along in the ages.

Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard but I've got something to show.

You know, found someone who can comfort me but there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane but I just want you to know.
