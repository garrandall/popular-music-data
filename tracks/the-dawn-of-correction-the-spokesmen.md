The western world has a common dedication
To keep free people from Red domination
And maybe you can't vote, boy, but man your battle stations
Or therell be no need for votin in future generations

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

There are buttons to push in two mighty nations
But whos crazy enough to risk annihilation?
The buttons are there to ensure negotiation
So don't be afraid, boy, it's our only salvation

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

You tell me that marches wont bring integration
But look what it's done for the voter registration
Be thankful our country allows demonstrations
Instead of condemnin, make some recommendations
I don't understand the cause of your aggravation
You mean to tell me, boy, it's not a better situation?

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

You missed all the good in your evaluation
What about the things that deserve commendation?
Where there once was no cure, there's vaccination
Where there once was a desert, there's vegetation
Self-governments replacing colonization
What about the Peace Corp. organization?
Don't forget the work of the United Nations

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction
