I was lost in time
Feelin' like the victim of a perfect crime
Until that night I met you
How was I to know just what your love could do

Now I believe
There has been a change in me
I believe
That it was meant to be
Oh, can't you see?
I believe in you and me

In the dark of night
We can be what we would like to be
And it's alright
When it's you, you and me, girl
Well, I feel like we're the only people in the world

I believe
There has been a change in me
(Now that you're always on my mind)
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
(And it will all work out in time)
Can't you see?
I believe in you and me

It's so easy
So damn easy to see
The way I feel for you
And you for me

Well, I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see?
I believe in you and me
(Now that you're always on my mind)
Oh, can't you see?
I believe in you and me

Oh, can't you see?
I believe in you and me
Oh, can't you see?
I believe in you and me
