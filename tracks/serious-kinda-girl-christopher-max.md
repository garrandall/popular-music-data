Oh, Chris
Oh

I'm searching for the serious
For the serious
For the serious
I remember my mother told me
Someday you'll find the one and only

I'm searching
I'm searching all over the world, yeah
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl for me

I'm searching
Searching the world
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl

Listen up to my story
Of all the pain and the glory
Of a boy with a heart
'Cause, baby, I think I'm ready to start

If I were king for just one day
And have fame, fortune and money
I'd still have to say not good enough
Because money can't buy me love
Oh, no, no

I'm searching
I'm searching all over the world, yeah
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl for me

I'm searching
Searching the world
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl

Been to places of plenty
And all the girls are so trendy
And willing to be your friend
As long as you had a Porsche or a Benz

I remember my mama told me
One day, you will find the only girl
Who will love you
And keep you feeling right
Every day and every single night
Oh, no, no

I'm searching
I'm searching all over the world, yeah
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl for me

I'm searching
Searching the world, yeah
For the serious
Looking for you, baby
Searching for you, baby

Could be you
(Me, who?)
You
Could be you
(Me, who?)
You

I've been searching for, oh, so long
And it seems like it's all in vain
But somehow I know my heart's not wrong
If she's out there
I'll find her someday

I'm searching
Searching for you, baby
For the serious
I'm searching for you, darling

I'm searching
All over the world now
For the serious
The serious kind of girl
Yeah, yeah

I'm searching
I'm searching for you, baby
For the serious
Searching for you, darling

I'm searching
All over the world now
For the serious
The serious kind of girl
Yeah, yeah

Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, baby
Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, girl

Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, baby
Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, girl

Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, baby
Oh, Chris, oh, Chris
Yes, girl

I'm searching all over the world, yeah
I'm searching for you, baby
For the serious kind of girl

All over the world now
Searching the world
For the serious kind of girl

Searching for you, baby
Searching all over the world, yeah
Searching for you, darling
For the serious kind of girl

All over the world
Searching the world
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl
