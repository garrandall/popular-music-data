(Things get a little easier, once you understand)



I'll be expecting you to get a haircut by Friday

Forget it dad, that won't change anything

Forget, nothing, you'll do as I say as long as you are living in my house

He knows I'm not feeling well
And yet he doesn't take out one second out to help his mother
His only concern is for himself

Come on ma, what do you want from me

Don't argue with your mother, just shut up and listen

But mom, all my friends will be there

I said no, you can't go

But why

I don't want you in that neighborhood

Why, what's wrong with that neighborhood

I don't like the kind of people living there

What's wrong with them

Never mind, some day you will thank me

Are you sure nobody kept you company tonight while you were baby sitting

What's that supposed to mean

Just curious

Admit it mom, you don't trust me

Where are you going now

To my friend's house

Don't you have things to do in the house
Don't you have homework
Why don't you sit down and read a book

Oh ma

Don't oh ma me
You're wasting your life away with foolish things

What are you talking about
How about your bridge club and your ladies groups
And your parties and your daytime programs
How about all that

That's different

Ma, I'll be home at 11

You better be home at 10 or don't bother to come home at all

When I was your age, I was working 12 hours a day
6 days a week helping to pay for the food and the rent

I don't understand, what's that got to do with me

If you can't figure that out for yourself, you're stupid

Hey dad, did you see my new guitar, I joined a group

Son, there's a little more to life than joining a group and playing a guitar

Yeah dad, what is there to life (life, life)


Mr Cook

Yes

Do you have a son named Robin, Robin Cook age 17

Yes

I'm sorry Mr Cook, you better come down to the station house
Your son is dead

Dead? How

He died of a overdose

Oh my god
