Poor little rich girl
I know why you're blue
You finally found something, that your daddy won't buy for you
Whoa, poor little rich girl
How happy you could be
If you hadn't fallen in love with a poor boy like me

If I were a rich boy, I could make you mine
But tonight when I kiss you, it will be for the very last time
Whoa, poor little rich girl
It's sad but its true,
In the eyes of the world I'm not good enough for you

It would have been better, if we had never met
Ah you'd be without a care in the world, with nothing to forget
Ah poor little rich girl
How happy you could be
If you hadn't fallen in love with a poor boy like me

Ah poor little rich girl
How happy you could be,
If you hadn't fallen in love with a poor boy like me

Poor little rich girl
Poor little rich girl
Poor little rich girl
Poor little rich girl...
(Fade)
