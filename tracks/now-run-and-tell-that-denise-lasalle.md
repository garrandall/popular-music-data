Every big city man goin' 'round town, yes
He been tellin' how he loves, the men'll put him down, oh yes he has
Ah, He gets what he wants and he blow yo' mind
Ah, but baby you a-met yo' match this time, oh yeah
Hey Hey Mr. Playboy, Hey Romeo
It broke yo' heart 'cause I let 'choo go
You been tellin' everybody where it's at
Now run and tell that (Run Home!)
Dat's what ya gotta do, now (Run and tell that)
You say you never met a girl that 'choo couldn't win, dat's wut 'choo s'id
And if you been there once, you can go back again, oh yes you did
But ain't no two-timin', Bone crushin' sweet-talkin' john...no bab'eh
...Gonna get my love and then turn it wrong, Uh-Uh you ain't
Hey Hey Mr. Playboy, Hey Romeo
It hurt 'choo bad 'cause I let 'choo go
You been tellin' everybody where it's at
Now run and tell that (Run Home!)
Dat's what ya gotta do, now (Run and tell that)
You s'id you were the plainest man alive, oh yes you did
But I made up my mind to cut 'choo down to size, oh yeah
I'll put something on yo' mind you'll never forget, no bab'eh
I've got 'choo walking in a daze you ain't recovered yet, oh no
Ay, Hey Mr. Big Stuff, Hey Romeo
You can tell the world that I told you so
Dat I was gonna show yo' where it's at
Now run and tell that (Run Home!)
Dat's what ya gotta do, now (Run and tell that)
Run Home (Run Home!)
Now run and tell that (Run and tell that)
Run Home (Run Home!)
Now run and tell that (Run and tell that)
Hey Mr. Big Stuff (Run Home!)
Now run and tell that (Run and tell that)
Hey Romeo (Run Home!)
Didn't I let 'choo go (Run and tell that)
Hey, Bab'eh! (Run Home!)
Now run and tell that (Run and tell that)
