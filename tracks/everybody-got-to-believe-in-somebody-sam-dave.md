If you walk away from me
My whole world will crumble down
I've been searching for someone like you
You were lost, but now you're found
What you found babe
Tenderness when you need it
And a kiss for every goodbye
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Say you'll give me a try

Believe in me for every moment
Don't you ever let your faith down
For believing is better than grieving
Girl I know I'll never ever make you cry
If you do, your only tears will be tears of joy
You'll wonder what kind of girl am I

Starting now
Say you'll give me try

Believe when I say I want you
Believe me oh I'm always going to
No disappointment or naughty things
I'm only gonna give you joy
You'll have no time to learn about pain
Your only tears will be tears of joy
Ooh what kind of man am I
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Say you'll give me a try

Everybody got to believe in somebody
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Believe in you, believe in me
Believe in somebody baby
Come on believe in me baby
Everyday you got to believe, you got to believe
