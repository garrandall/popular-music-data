I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster, I hear your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away


I thought I was doin' fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms
My God, you're smilin' and you catch my eye
My heart is pounding deep inside



Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright day light
My heart beats faster, I call your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away



Your pretty little finger
Baby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
Pretty little finger
