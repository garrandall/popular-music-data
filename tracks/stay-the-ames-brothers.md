Secondary school dropout
Never home, Man call me a dirty stopout
Ten stone so they think I'm easy to knockout
Until they see me pull a shank or a kosh out
I been in some sticky situations
I ain't lucky, black magic's how I got out
I've been a victim of police discrimination
I've already clocked 'em long before they hop out
There's only one option it's way too hot out
What's the problem, they don't wanna see an Ex-con out?
I know they ain't harassing every Harry, Dick and Tom out
I'm just doing a promo for my very latest song out
I ain't done fuck all go back to the cop house
This is illegal hustle, see me handing any rock out? (No)
Go ahead get the sniffing dog out
Then apologise when you have to let me go
Cause you ain't gonna find shit, except my dough
Not one line on me, no extra phone
And an answer every time they felt a question go
Like, 'where I'm coming from? '
I just left Jerome's
Like, 'where I'm heading to? '
I'm heading home
Like what I do for money
Look, I'm selling loads of CD's
This is really a stepping stone
I leave shows with a bag five in the envelope
And my agenda so busy I don't get to roll
With the mandem like before
I wanna let 'em know
The other day I watched an episode of Friends
And it reminded me of when we were together most days
Now it's like he couldn't see me through a telescope
(Fuck) What's wrong with me?
Pick up a telephone
Dial the number in
If it rings out leave a message
So the record shows when I called
But for all I know a brother could be livin' like an Eskimo
Heaven knows it's been a while since Swift linked up
Tell your family said hello (hello)
It's music people know me for
But my people are my people so they know me more
And when it comes to success
My nigga Ish would tell you music isn't the only door
Football was a good call
Even if you team ain't anywhere within the Premier
The way it's going on it won't be long before it gets him there
Now his head is clear I bet he has a better year
Get the P's in
These pockets are big enough to keep the Queen in
Some call me GH, Peacon calls me G-son
My name used to be J-Reaper and then Freedom
My birth name's Justin
My dawgs call me Wretch
What's next?
Ghetts; I swapped the O for the S
Oh yes
I'm a man with a lot of names
A man with dirt on my hands I can't wash away
A man only hell can accommodate
But I'm also a man only God could change
I smoke til the pain's gone away
Blue slims, Mayfair and some proper Haze
When it comes to Chronic, I'm Dr. Dre
Two eighths a day
How much can my body take?
Lose control when the drugs start to dominate
I can't act like the thought ain't never crossed my brain (it has)
It ain't nothing rare
It's a common case
I can make drugs disappear, there's a lot of ways
Can't say no
Where the weed at?
Get the light out
I'm Winehouse, no Rehab
It's not affecting my music in any way
No way, all I need is a mic with no feedback
I used to get the peng off Mishak
Now he's on remand for something that he never did
Police keep locking up the mandem
Where the keys at?
Free Titch, free Ashman and free Shaq
Free Shorts and free my nigga T-man
And when each and every one of them are home
All I'm gonna say is 'how does it feel to be a free man? '
Free Shocks, free Shots when he lands
Oops I nearly forgot, when's Aaron out?
That's a nigga that I can't wait to see back about (MY NIGGA!)
I just heard Smokey's back in
I never knew, what happened now?
In fact the feds were always tryna catch him
They let him go and get him again when he's back around
It's a vicious cycle and I'm glad I'm out
Repping my niggas through the music
I'mma throw a party when they're back in town
Big dance, massive crowd
Get the champagne
Get the cameras out
Take a picture my nigga
So it's a permanent fixture my nigga
Come smoke, come and have a drink with me, nigga
Come to a show
Come on a link with me nigga
Couple girls, you can take one or two
Introduce a group to Ame on the loop
Reminiscing
As this beat stays on a loop
Ross is on lock but when he's not make room
