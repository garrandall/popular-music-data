Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waitin' there too long, my love
All that time, without a word
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget or I'd regret


The special love I had for you
My baby blue


All the days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know, I would show


The special love I have for you
My baby blue


What can I do, what can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me a way
Don't you know the times I've tried?


Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feelin' just grows stronger everyday
Just one thing before I go
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow
The special love you have for me
My Dixie dear
