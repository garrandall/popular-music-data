VERSE 1
The night was black, rain falling down
Looked for my Baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
Afraid she's gone for ever more

CHORUS 1
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
“I took your Baby from you away"
I heard a voice crying in the deep
“Come join me Baby in my endless sleep"

VERSE 2
Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my Baby has gone from me

CHORUS 1

VERSE 3
Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darling, held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea

CHORUS 2
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
“You took your baby from me away"
My heart cried out “she's mine to keep
I saved my Baby from an endless sleep"
