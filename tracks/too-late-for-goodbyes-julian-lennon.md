Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die


But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes


Time has gone since I've been with you
We've been starting to die
Now it seems you don't care for me
And I don't understand why




Ever since you've been far away
I've been wanting to fly
Now I know what you meant to me
I'm the one who should cry

Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die

Oh, ah
Dit dit dit dit doo
Ba da ba da ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
