He called me his teenage
Cleopatra (Cleopatra)
He called me his princess
Of the Nile (of the Nile)

But I laughed at him (at him)
And I'd say to myself
Isn't he silly and doesn't he
Talk like a child

He called me the queen
Of all his treasure (Cleopatra)
Said I'd rule his world with
Only my smile (only my smile)

But I laughed at him
And I'd say to myself
Isn't he silly and
Doesn't he talk kind of wild

But long can you laugh
At a loving heart
How much can a
Loving heart take

One day
He walked away from me
And I thought I'd made
His heart break

Then one day, I saw him walking
Down the street with another girl
And I could see they were in love

Now he calls her his teenage
Cleopatra (Cleopatra)
He calls her his princess
Of the Nile (of the Nile)

And I cried, how I cried
Cause I see lost him now
Now that it's too late
And I know he'll never be mine

Now that it's too late
And I know he'll never be mine
Now that it's too late
And I know he'll never be mine
