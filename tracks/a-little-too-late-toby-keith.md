It is a little too late
I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I am letting go while I am still strong enough to
It is got a little too sad
I am a little too blue
It is a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I am big time over your baby
It is a little too late


No I do not want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah talk about water under the bridge
You should know by now girl that is all this is


It is a little too late
I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I am letting go while I am still strong enough to
It is got a little too sad
I am a little too blue
It is a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I am big time over your baby
It is a little too late


There was a time
This heart of mine
Would take you back every time
Do not you know?
It is been two packs of cigarettes
A sleepless night
A nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you have got no business coming around
I am closing up shop
Shutting us down


It is a little too late
I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I am letting go while I am still strong enough to
It is got a little too sad
I am a little too blue
It is a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I am big time over your baby
It is a little too late
