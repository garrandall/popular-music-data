Itâs a little too late
Iâm a little too gone, 
A little too tired of this hanginâ on
So Iâm letting go while Iâm still strong enough to
Itâs got a little too sad
Iâm a little too blue
Itâs a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Iâm big time over you baby
Itâs a little too late

No I donât want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wastinâ is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah talk about water under the bridge,
You should know by now girl thatâs all this is


Itâs a little too late,
Iâm a little too gone, 
A little too tired of just hanginâ on
Iâm letting go while Iâm still strong enough to
Itâs got a little too sad,
Iâm a little too blue
Itâs a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Iâm big time over you baby
Itâs a little too late

There was a time,
this heart of mine,
would take you back every time
donât you know
Itâs been two packs of cigaretts
a sleepless night
a nervous wreck, a day ago.
Now you ainât got no business coming around
Iâm closing up shop
Shuttinâ us down


Itâs a little too late,
Iâm a little too gone, 
A little too tired of just hanginâ on
Iâm letting go while Iâm still strong enough to
Itâs got a little too sad,
Iâm a little too blue
Itâs a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Iâm big time over you baby
Itâs a little too late
Iâm big time over you baby,
Itâs a little too late
