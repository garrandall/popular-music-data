Black is black, I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey, since she went away, oh oh
What can I do, 'cause I, I'm feelin' blue


If I had my way, she'd be here today
But she'd go in time, and leave me to cry again, oh no
What can I do, cause I, I'm feelin' blue
I can't choose, it's too much to lose when our love's too strong
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong
Bad is bad, that I feel so sad
It's time, it's time, that I felt peace of mind, oh oh
What can I do, cause I, I'm feelin' blue
I can't choose, it's too much to lose when our love's too strong
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong


Black is black, I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey, since she went away, oh oh
What can I do, 'cause I, I'm feelin' blue
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue, 'cause I, I'm feelin' blue
