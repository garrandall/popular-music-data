Laugh everyone at the clown
He's the best one in town, ah ha
Ride on his merry-go-round
Spinning faster than sound, ah ha, ah ha

Laugh as the funny man cries
Though his makeup is smeared, ah ha
Laugh at his comical tears
As he thinks of the years, ah ha, ah ha

Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
Ah ah ah ah ah
Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
(Ah ha ha) oh no no

Laugh everyone at the fool
With his heart in his hand, ah ha
Still he can't quite understand
That he's less than a man, ah ha, ah ha

Lost somewhere deep in his shell 
There's an ember of pride, ah ha
Watch how he tries hard to hide
That he's dying inside, ah ha, ah ha

Hey we're living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy 
Ah ha ha ha ha (sometimes it's hard sometimes it's hard)

Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy 
Ah ha ha ha ha (Oh no no no no)

Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy (some fool might plan though life gonna change)
Ah ah ah ah ah

Living just a little (sometimes, yes sir)
Laughing just a little
Ainât easy (whoa) 
Ah ha ha ha ha (oh can I say it, can I, can I say it just one more time)
Living just a little 
Laughing just a little (oh)
Ainât easy (it ainât easy, no no, no no no no) 
Ah ha ha ha ha
Living just a little (living)
Laughing just a little (in this mean world)
Ainât easy (oh it ainât easy âsometimes you feel like a clown)
Ah ha ha ha ha
Living just a little (when they turn your world around)
Laughing just a little (still you gotta smile sometimes)
Ainât easy (oh)
Ah ha ha ha ha (wonât you help me, ah could you help me)
Living just a little (live)
Laughing just a little (I wanna laugh sometimes, yeah)
Ainât easy (hey)
Ah ha ha ha ha (hey hey)
Living just a little (my) 
Laughing just a little (lord)
Ainât easy (oh)
Ah ha ha ha ha 
Living just a little (sometimes you feel like youâre riding on a cloud) 
Laughing just a little (and for crying out loud things go wrong)
Ainât easy (the next minute)
Ah ha ha ha ha (that song is through and things ainât the same way no no no no no)
Living just a little
Laughing just a little (no)
Ainât easy (no it ainât easy)
Ah ha ha ha ha (let me hear you say it, can I hear you say it oh one more time with me)
Living just a little (Iâm in misery)
Laughing just a little (one day Iâll be free)
Ainât easy (Iâll be smiling again Iâll be smiling again)
Ah ha ha ha ha (Iâll be smiling)
Living just a little (oh)
Laughing just a little (oh just trying to do it)
Ainât easy 
Ah ha ha ha ha (just a little bit yall, just a little little love, and a little bit of love)
Living just a littleâ¦
