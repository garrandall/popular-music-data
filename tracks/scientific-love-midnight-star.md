Are you out to speculate
Come here to date and to find a mate
Two hearts a scientific find
Searching for love for a very long time
So I got my eyes on you
Take time to know me if
Show me
I need much more than a one night lover


Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
(Oh show me baby - Scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love


We are more than right to be
Finally keeping the company
Can't stop this chemical reaction
Better if we make it everlasting


So you don't wanna be alone
You'd better walk into my heart right now oh
And yeah you wanna be free yeah
Well I'm telling you
Scientifically


Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
Oh show me baby (scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love
Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
Oh show me baby (scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love

Oh show me
Scientific love


So you don't wanna be alone
You'd better walk into my heart right now oh
And yeah you wanna be free yeah
Well I'm telling you
Scientifically


Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
Oh show me baby (scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love


I like to find I like to
I like to be a scientific man
Wanna hug you, squeeze you and make you feel right
I'll be just around midnight
If around the day
He will teach just how to love a scientific way
If it's true e is mc square
Just call me baby I'll soon be there


I want it I need it I can't do without it
Scientific love
I want it I need it I just can't have it
I really need your love


Two hearts that feel like one
Scientific love
You and me having fun
Scientific love


Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
Oh show me baby (scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love
