I got a heart
And I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone


So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground


I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18


We took a chonce 
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine


So pour me a drink, oh, love,
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can livin' love in slow motion, motion, motion


So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground


I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18


When we were 18
Oh, Lord, when we were 18


Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground


I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing


To be loved and to be in love


And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
