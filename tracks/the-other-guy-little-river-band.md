I found out that you care for another guy
I found out that you want for another smile
We are alone as two different people can be
And it's hurting me so 
Just to know that you don't care for me

The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again

I found out that your heart's in another guy
You found out that you're tellin' another lie
We've gone apart and goin' our own separate ways
And you don't understand 
Why I love you and want you to stay

The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again

You don't know it's me that you need
You're thinking of him and I can't compete
Well I'm here to say I still want you back again
