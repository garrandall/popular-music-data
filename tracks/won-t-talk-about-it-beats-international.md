(Check the beat now)

I don't wanna cause
Any trouble in town
I don't want it
I just want you to know
That I'm around if you need me

If you've been left all alone
You can just pick up the phone
(I won't talk about it)
And dial up L-O-V-E
(I won't talk about it)
Baby, you can call on me
(I won't talk about it)

I know there's things that I might say
That might get in the way
But that's not what I wanted to do
I just wanna get next to you

(I won't talk about it)
I don't wanna bring you down
(I won't talk about it)
(I won't talk about it)
I just wanna be around
(I won't talk about it)
(I won't talk about it)

Nobody will know wherever we go
Whatever we do or see
Your secret's safe with me

I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it

I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it...
