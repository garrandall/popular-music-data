Well I've been on the road
for a long time
met a lot of women
had to leave them all behind
'cause I want to go back
to the land I love
where Magnolia smells sweet
and white cotton is warm


Take me on back
Back to the country
Take me on down, down
Greenwood Mississippi

Old farmer John
he lives down the road
works in the fields
carryin' a heavy load
He don't have to worry
'bout a thing
'cause everyday now
you can hear him sing
