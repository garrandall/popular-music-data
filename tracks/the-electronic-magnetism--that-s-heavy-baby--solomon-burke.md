Baby, I got myself together
I'm ready, willing?

And there's no time
(No time, no time, no time)
For foolish little things
I've left behind

Now I get high on just the thought
Of making love with you

The electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
(That's heavy, baby)

All my life
I've wanted someone like you
Would light up my life like
A Christmas tree, yessiree

Whatever you do or say
Is right on, right on
You see, you're the star in my life
That shines every night for me
Yes, indeed

Your kiss is like fresh
Rippling, rocking water
(Say it again, say it again)
That runs through my head
And right down to my feet

And whatever that it is
I know you've got for sure
Cause it keeps me
Running back for more

That electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
That's heavy, baby
That's heavy, baby

My, my, my, my, my, my
So heavy, baby

All it takes is just one kiss
From your sweet mouth
Just a look from your eyes to mine
Makes me feel like trying to climb
To climb and climb and climb

Whatever it is I know for sure
Cause it keeps me
Running back for more

That electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
Electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
Electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
