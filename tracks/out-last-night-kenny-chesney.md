We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to

There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hittin' on everybody and their mother

There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me

I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hittin' on everybody and their mother

There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other

They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight
When we went out last night
