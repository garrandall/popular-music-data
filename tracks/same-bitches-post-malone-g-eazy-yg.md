I been in L.A. too long
I see the same bitches everywhere I go
It don't really matter where they from
Acting or model, heard it all before
Population four million, how I see the same bitch?
Population four million, how I see the same bitch?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I hit your DM baby
Took the screenshot, yeah, you tried to play me
I bet this shit was good for your reputation
I just let it go so I could see you naked
Holy moly, look what you roll in
Million followers but your bumpers broken
What's your focus?
Tell me what your goal is
I know you only like me 'cause I just spent a hundred bands in one night
Spent a hundred bands in one night
I know you wanna live this life
But I can't make a ho a housewife (oh, no)
What's your name? Who's your daddy?
Is he rich like me? Is he rich like me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah


I been in L.A. too long
I see the same bitches everywhere I go
It don't really matter where they from
Acting or model, heard it all before
Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (uh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (Gerald)
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Everywhere I go I see the same ho
Always post selfies on the 'Gram from a angle, a Catfish
Hollywood devil, not a angel
Her bag is Chanel, but she drive a Durango
Yeah, and I'm gettin' to the queso
Woke and I'm hip to the game so I'm thankful
OGs put me on to a song lace bro
Real recognizin' that you don't speak the lingo
Clothes all new, not a wrinkle
Giving you the game with the game, gettin' sprinkled
Bottles on deck in my drink fool
And I turn to a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a pitbull
This life did to me, I can't switch back
If I take her then you'll never get your bitch back (yeah)
The beat knockin', yeah this shit cloud
Welcome to the west where people gettin' rich at (ayy)


I been in L.A. too long (G)
I see the same bitches everywhere I go (It's Eazy, you know?)
It don't really matter where they from (yee, yee, yee)
Acting or model, heard it all before (ayy)

Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (west side nigga)
Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (hol' up, let me talk my shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah


I been in L.A. too long
Me and my bros hit the same hoes
L.A., Hollywood, that's some Valley hoes
Do I know how to fuck, they all know
Ye, yeah, fuck it, go down baby
I'm with the program baby
Ridin' through the streets, you with the hometown baby
I'm tryna do it for the brother like Motown baby
She fucked the L.A. Laker for the record
She fucked a Dodger baseball player for the record
Fucked the head of my record label (oh
How you think she been so stable?
Ah damn, ah damn, but she down to fuck
Designer everything, Benz Truck
Pullin' up with you friend, tell me who she is
Oh, never mind, my friend fucked


Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (haha, never mind my friend fucked)
Population four million, how I see the same bitch?
(haha, never mind my friend fucked)

Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (I see the same bitch)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Population four million, how I see the same bitch? (I see the same bitch)
