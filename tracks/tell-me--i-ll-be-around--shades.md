Yeah, come on, Motown
Girls, help me sing it

1 -Tell me your name
('cause I wanna know)
What car do you drive
(And tell me where can we go)
How much money do you make
(How can I be down)
As long as you have
(I'll be around)
Tell me your name
('cause I wanna know)
What car do you drive
(And tell me where can we go)
How much money do you make
(How can I be down)
As long as you have
(I'll be around)

Most guys they come a dime a dozen
And they always try to get wit me
Don't think that I'm an opportunist
I fall in love but just not for free
So baby tell me

Repeat 1

Most guys they think that I'm a user
They think I take and then I never give
It's time for girls to make a statement
I'm going for mine
This lady's got to live
Oh, tell me

Repeat 1

If you want me
Then I must see
You'll give me
Any and everything that I need baby
I'll fall in love
If love is meant
'cause ain't nothin going on but the real
So tell me

Repeat until fade
