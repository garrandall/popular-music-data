Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
My folks moved to New York from California
I should have listened when my buddy said "I warn ya" (warn ya)
"There'll be no surfin' there and no one even ca-a-ares"

(My woody's outside) covered with snow
(Nowhere to go now) New York's a lonely town
When you're the only surfer boy around

From Central Park to Pasadena's such a long way
I feel so out of it walkin' down Broadway (Broadway)
I feel so bad each time I look out there and fi-i-ind

(My woody's outside) covered with snow
(Nowhere to go now) New York's a lonely town
When you're the only surfer boy around

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

I feel so bad each time I look out there and fi-i-ind

(My woody's outside) covered with snow
(Nowhere to go now) New York's a lonely town
When you're the only surfer boy around

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
FADE
Ahh, ahh
