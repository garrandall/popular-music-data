Hey, hey hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this payphone real quick

Hey, hey Toni, it's me, I was just calling, you know
Just calling to let you know, don't wait up for me tonight
I mean I just got a lot of things on my mind
I gotta think about, you know
Just umm, I'll be over Brian's house
You know, just for the night
I mean, I know things are different, but you know
It's not you, it's me, you know, it's really me, you know
And basically, I just think I'ma need some space


Why you calling me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're staying over your friends
Cause you've got a lot on your mind
Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me
So you say that things have changed
So tell me what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space?
Just don't make no excuses, no no


Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you wanna leave (I can tell you wanna leave), go on now
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things (So come and get your things and leave)
And go on right now, woo
Just be a man about it
Yeah, yeah, yeah


I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what you need, you know
I mean, I wanna love you and I'm gonna love you
One day but you know
I mean, you just gotta understand where I'm coming from


You say right now that you're not what I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off?
Telling me your mama said I'm not what you need
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be
Just don't make no excuses, no no


Why you gotta lie to me?, no no, yeah
Just be a man about it
Baby, you ain't gotta lie to me, no no no, no (baby, you ain't gotta lie to me)
Just be a man about it
If you wanna leave (I can tell you wanna leave), go right now
Just be a man about it
Come and get your things (so come and get your things and leave)
And go, baby
Just be a man about it, ohyeah, oh


Can you tell me how
You can say you're in love
And then treat me so bad?
Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe
The way you handled things
You want to lie
If you were a man...


Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it (Just be a man about it baby)
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it
You ain't gotta lie to me, no no baby (I can tell you wanna leave)
Just be a man about it
If you wanna go grab your things and leave now
So come and get your things and leave
(Don't wanna stay, don't wanna be no more lying)
Just be a man about it
(If you wanna go on and leave)
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
(You ain't gotta be here so leave, no)
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it
(Baby, just be a man, woo)
I can tell you wanna leave
Just be a man about it
So come and get your things and leave
Just be a man about it
