Can't you see 
I love you 
Please don't break my heart in two 
That's not hard to do 
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart 
And if you say goodbye 
Then I know that I would cry 
Maybe I would die 
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart 
There's no strings upon this love of mine 
It was always you from the start 
Treat me nice 
Treat me good 
Treat me like you really should 
'Cause I'm not made of wood 
And I don't have a wooden heart 

Muss I denn, muss I denn 
Zum Stadtele hinaus 
Stadtele hinaus 
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier? 

There's no strings upon this love of mine 
It was always you from the start 
Sei mir gut 
Sei mir gut 
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst 
Wie du wirklich sollst 
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
