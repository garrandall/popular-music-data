Lost in the Milky Way
Smile at the empty sky and wait for
The moment a million chances may all collide
I'll be the guiding light
Swim to me through stars that shine down
And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth

So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley

From cradles to sleepless nights
You breathe in life forever
And stare at the world from deep under eiderdown

So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the first time

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley

Although this world is a crazy ride
You take your seat and hold on tight

So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the first time

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley

The life of Riley
The life of Riley
The life of Riley
