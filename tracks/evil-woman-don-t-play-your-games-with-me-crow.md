I see the look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
The morrow will not change your shameful deed
You will be someone else' fertile seed
Evil woman don't play your games with me
Evil woman don't play your games with me

Now I know just what your looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
But I know that it was he, not me
And you know just how it's got to be
Evil woman don't play your games with me
Evil woman don't play your games with me

Wickedness lies in your moistened lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Black cats lay atop your satin bed
You sure wish that you could see me dead
Evil woman don't play your games with me
Evil woman don't play your games with me
