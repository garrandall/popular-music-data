Hey
Hey

I wanna read it in my magazine
I wanna hear it on my radio
There's no limit to the magic
Of this love that we know
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-whoa

And it's deeper than any eye can see
But it's more than just a mystery
This feeling's taking over me

The way we do the things we do
Second nature
The way we made our fantasy come true
Second nature
Well, it's a finger-snapping, be-bop can't stop thing
Second nature
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), whoa-oh-whoa

Hey
It's not enough to show you how I feel
Cause this love I've got for you is really real
And it's a miracle of timing
When it comes so naturally

And we're standing, we're going strong
And when other dreams have come and gone
Our love will keep us keeping on

The way we do the things we do
Second nature
The way we made our fantasy come true
Second nature
Well, it's a finger-snapping, be-bop can't stop thing
Second nature
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), whoa-oh-whoa

You are my river, you are my fire
Overflowing, getting higher and higher
And love will remain, pulls me to the flame
Then I'm burning, (burning), burning, (burning)
This feeling's returning

Second nature
Second nature

Woo
In every lover's heart the story's being told
With a message saying
Oh, I love you, oh, I love you
Oh, I love you so

The way we do the things we do
Second nature
The way we made our fantasy come true
Second nature
Well, it's a finger-snapping, be-bop can't stop thing
Second nature
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), yeah

The way we do the things we do
Second nature
The way we made our fantasy come true
Second nature
I say can it be, can it be?
Second nature
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), whoa-oh-oh
Could it be? (yada-yada-yada-yada)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa-whoa)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh), oh-oh
