Here I go again, it's all right
Full moons grown to brighten the night
I've been lookin', now seein' the light
It's sure shinin' bright, yea

Well, honey, believe in it, it bein' free mm
Nothin' to love's like nothin' to be
You've got once a lifetime
To see just how much of your dream

Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Honey, to feel like fallin' in love

Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind
Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again
Well, it's time to be taken in
Let me know where I've been, yea

Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love

Honey to feel like fallin' in love

Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind
Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again
Well it's time to be taken in
Let me know where I've been

Thought I said

Just let me feel like fallin' in love
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love
Honey to feel like fallin' in love

Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love
Honey to feel like fallin' in love
