Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence I canât take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound


And I donât even know how I survive
I wonât make it to the shore without your light
No I donât even know if Iâm alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like

Nothing to hold but the memories and frames
Oh they remind me of the battle I face
without your love, without you I drown
Somebody save me Iâm going down


And I donât even know how I survive
I wonât make it to the shore without your light
No I donât even know if Iâm alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like


And I donât even know how I survive
I wonât make it down the road with one headlight
No I donât even know if Iâm alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
