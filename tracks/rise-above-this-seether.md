Take the light, and darken everything around me
Call the clowns and listen closely, I'm lost without you

Call your name every day when I feel so helpless
I'm fallen down but I'll rise above this, rise above this

Hate the mind, regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know, this void will grow
Everything's in vain, distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right, but I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day, when I feel so helpless
I've fallen down (fallen down), but I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name everyday, when I seem so helpless
I've fallen down (fallen down), and I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

I'll mend myself before it gets me
(I'll mend myself before it gets me)
I'll mend myself before it gets me
(I'll mend myself before it gets me)

Call your name every day, when I feel so helpless
I've fallen down but I'll rise above this, rise above this
Forty-eight ways to say that I'm feelin' helpless
I've falling down, falling down, but I'll rise above this, rise above this, rise above this, rise above this doubt
