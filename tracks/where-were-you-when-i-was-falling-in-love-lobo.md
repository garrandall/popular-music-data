When your eyes met mine
I knew that I had better play it cool
I'm doing my best trying to resist
Cause I ain't no fool

Where in the world did you come from baby
You waited just a little too long
To look my way
Now it's a little to late

Where were you
When I was falling in love
I was looking for you baby
Where were you
When I was falling in love
Looking for you baby
If I'd ever looked in those eyes before
We'd be together tonight I'm sure
Where were you
When I was falling in love
Where were you
Lost and looking for love

If I'd have met you sooner
I'd be talking to ya and playing the game
But the best thing for me to do
Is get up and leave without knowing your name
It might have been something special baby
Something only people in love could understand
Like this ring on my hand
