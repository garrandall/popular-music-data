I flip the switch on my laser video
And there's the man staring back at me
He starts to speak in a voice so righteous
About the sins of society
He's got answers to all my problems
Says he'll decide what I should hear and see
I try to change to another station
But all I get is more of his morality
And morality, yeah
But I see the kids of a new generation
And they won't stand for this mind control
They're gonna change this world we live in
They're gonna bring back the rock and roll
So if I can, I'm gonna break from this prison
Gonna get out and join in the fight
Take a chance on what I believe in
Win or lose, I know it's right
'cause it's high time
For us to start a revolution
High time
Just like an a-bomb explosion
High time
It ain't the music that's in question
High time
It's more the freedom of expression
Change is comin'
Mind police are comin'
We're on the move
The old world is crumblin'
A new day's comin'
Tell your friends and relations
We're on the move
We're gonna start a rockin' nation
High time
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
High time
We're gonna start a revolution
High time
 Everybody lay back now JY (nickname of Styx guitarist James Young)

"I've been instructed to inform you that your privileges have been penalized
Your avoidance tactics have proven disappointing."

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Now here's Roboto."

"Himitsu." (Japanese for "secret")
High time
For us to start a revolution
High time
Just like an a-bomb explosion
High time
It ain't the music that's in question
High time
It's more the freedom of expression
Change is comin'
Mind police are comin'
We're on the move
The old world is crumblin'
A new day's comin'
Tell your friends and relations
We're on the move
We're gonna start a rockin' nation
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-band on the move, yeah
High time
Yeah
High time
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-band on the move
High time
"what will this thing cost, man? look at the costs!"
"hundreds and hundreds!"
