My heart starts breaking
When I think of making
A plan to let you go
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
I'm gonna let you know
But I when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only love I ever knew
Every time I think of you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

My heart's been hurting
When I see you flirting
Every night out on the floor
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
You'll grow to love me more
But whenever we're together
I could leave you never
Even though you treat me cruel
Every time I look at you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

I tried to resist you
When you're gone, all I ever do is miss you
Anyone in love would know
Anyone with half a heart
Could never let you go

But I when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only girl I ever loved
Can't you tell me why do you hurt me
I guess some people never see
Especially a fool like me

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

To ever let you go
I'll never let you go
(To ever let you go)
