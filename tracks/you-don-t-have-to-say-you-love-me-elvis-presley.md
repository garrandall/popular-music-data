When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away


But don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home


You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
That you don't have to love me
But believe me, I'll never tie you down


Left alone just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel


You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, oh believe me

Oh, you don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me, oh believe me
