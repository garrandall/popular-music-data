Your heart for takeaway

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey hey hey
Where do you think you're going?
It's so late late late
What's wrong?
I said I can't stay
Do I have to give a reason?
It's just me me me
It's what I want

So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

Before I love you na na na
I'm gonna leave you na na na
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine

Before I love you na na na
Gonna leave you na na na
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

Your heart for takeaway yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Your heart for takeaway yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fate fate fate
Is that what came between us?
Or did we do this on our own?

So how did we get here?
I'm asking myself why I'm so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

Before I love you na na na
I'm gonna leave you na na na
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart
So you don't break mine

Before I love you na na na
I'm gonna leave you na na na
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

Your heart for takeaway yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Before I love you na na na
I'm gonna leave you na na na
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart
