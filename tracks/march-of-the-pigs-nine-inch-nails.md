Step right up, march, push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please, greed, feed
(No time to hesitate)
I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down


All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't that make you feel better?


Shove it up, inside, surprise!
Lies, stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down


All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
The pigs have won tonight
Now they can all sleep soundly
And everything is all right
