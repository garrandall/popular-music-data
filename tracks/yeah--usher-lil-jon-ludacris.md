Peace up, A Town down, Philly, yeah, yeah, okay, okay
Usher, Usher, wait, Lil Jon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Luda, Usher, Lil Jon and Free
When its time, only niggers' rock designer first
And we pull up and we crush the curb
And the rims so deep, you can't find your feet
Can't see past the truck, past the Phantom, the click
I catch Hummer, Benz, and Bentley's
Wrist froze, step on the grease, crush the guard
And, with Jay-Z twisting up weed, the Big Bad Wolf
He'll puff your hut down, the gauge, I'll buck rounds
Leave you with no knees, the O.G., probably bouncing to rap music
The four life fluid and it does make the chicks' scream


Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon's got the beat that make's your booty go smack
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go


I was up in the club with my homies'
Trying to get a little V I
Keep it down on the low key, low key
You should know how it feels, hey, hey
I saw the shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game, she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me, know me
I decided to chill, okay, conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow, watch out
Oh, watch out, she's saying, 'Come get me', 'Come get me'
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, 'Baby, let's go', when I told her, 'Let's go', I said


Yeah, yeah, shorty got down on her knees, said 'Come and get me'
Yeah, yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah, her and my girl used to be the best of homies'
Yeah, yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming

 + (Lil' Jon in backround)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah - yeah!
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah - yeah!

 + (*Lil' Jon*)
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good time to take her with me (with me)
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave - now!) (*let's let's go!*)
Now I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10 she's a certified 20
But that just ain't me (*hey!*)
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it going to lead?
But what I do know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she "get low!"
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She ask for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
(*Let's go bring the beat back!*) and I said..

 + (Lil' Jon)

 + (Lil' Jon in backround)

 + (*Lil' Jon*)
Watch out, my outfit's rediculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow (*yeah!*)
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth (*what?!*)
I won't stop until I get them in they birthday suits (*yeah, yeah!*)
So give me the rhythm and it'll be of with they clothes
Then bend over to the FRONT - and touch your toes!
I - left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put them on foot patrol (*let's go!*) (ow!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please (*yeah*)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (*yeah!*)
Me and Ush once more and we leaves them dead
We want a lady in the streets but a freak in the bed - that say..

 + (Lil' Jon in backround)

 + (Lil' Jon in backround)


Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Usher's got the voice that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go (smack)
