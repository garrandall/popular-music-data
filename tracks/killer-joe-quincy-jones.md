Shucky Ducky, quack quack
Kick that sh...
Yeah, this is how we do it
Just lounging back, coolin' out
In here coolin' out with my girl Queen Latifah
You know what I'm saying?


(Ha, what's up, Tone?)
Ah baby, you know I'm just coolin'
How you doin'?
(It's all love)
Yeah, well why don't we just kick it?
Why don't we break outta here
And go on over to Q's Jook Joint, party down
(Q's Jook Joint?) You know what I'm saying?
(Nah, you know I ain't used to falling up in places like that
I ain't that type of girl)
Yeah (What's going on down there?)
Girl, don't you know who's gon' be there tonight?
Killer Joe, baby

Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe

Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe


Yeah, Cool Joe cat
Where he gone at? When he coming back in mine?
Don't he know that, 'cause it show that
When he come home every time
And he ain't no good, and I know I should
Let him go when he go, but...
Know that's my Killer Joe
You can't have him no more
It's the way he walk, and talk and spits his game
The way he says his name
Killer Joe (Killer Joe, baby)
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe (Shucky Ducky, quack quack)
I love him so


Cool Joe (Killer Joe), Mean Joe
Cool Joe (Let me know), Mean Joe
Cool Joe (Where'd you go), Mean Joe
Cool Joe (Hey, Joe...)
(Killer Joe)

Killer Joe, missed you so
Don't it show; hey, Joe

Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe

Cool Joe (Killer Joe), Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe (Kiss me slow), Mean Joe
Cool Joe

Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe, Mean Joe
Cool Joe


Yeah, I told you Killer Joe was coming down here tonight, baby
