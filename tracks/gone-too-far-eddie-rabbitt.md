I was heading home I hadn't planned on you
I shouldn't be here now, but tell me, what can I do?
The way you're looking in my eyes
Well, I'm beginning to realize it's true
It's you
And baby we've

Gone too far, I'm gonna wake up in your arms
Gone too far, but I can't help it, I'm fallin'

The way you look at me, the way I look at you
The way you're touching me, the way I'm touching you
You're pullin' all the right strings, baby
You're sayin' all the right things, baby, to me
To me
And I believe we've

Gone too far, feels too good to turn back now
Gone too far, but I can't help it, I'm fallin'

You're pullin' all the right strings baby
You're sayin' all the right things, baby, to me
To me
And don't you know we've

Gone too far, I'm gonna wake up in your arms
Gone too far, but I can't help it, I'm fallin'

Gone too far, feels too good to turn back now
Gone too far, but I can't help it, I'm fallin'
