Time seemed to pass me by
I found myself alone, wondering why
You came into my life
And gave your love to me
You are the one
That showed me the way
In my heart you'll stay

And I believe in you
Whoa-oh through and through
Always and forever it will be
You and me together

I want your love forever
I need your love
You're the only one
That fills my heart
And I love you
More and more everyday

And I believe in you
Whoa-oh through and through
Always and forever it will be you and me
I will sing to you and all you do
Always and forever it will be you and me together
