Hello, hello baby you called?
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say
Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call when you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone
My, my, my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone
My, my, my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

"We're sorry
