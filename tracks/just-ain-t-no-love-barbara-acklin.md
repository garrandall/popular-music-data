Now I know why the sky is blue
It sees the sin and heartbreak in you
It sees everything that you don't see, yeah
Do you wonder why you're in misery
If the sky don't have eyes tell me why does it cry

Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
In this world at all, aw, no

So much hurting and taking alike
Oh, paradise what could it be like?
All my love is like a grain of sand
But like mountains if they were in every man
There are tears in my eyes, I hurt so deep inside

Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
In this world at all, aw, no

There are tears in my eyes, I hurt so deep inside

Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
In this world at all, aw, no

Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
Just ain't love, yeah
(I don't know why, ain't no love)
In this world at all, aw, no
