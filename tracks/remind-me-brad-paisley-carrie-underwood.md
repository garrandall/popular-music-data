We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again

 Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
 Remind me, remind me
 So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
 Remind me, remind me


Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
 I felt bad cause you missed your flight
 But that meant we had one more night


Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
 Remind me, baby, remind me

Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
 Remind me, baby, remind me

 I wanna feel that way
 Yeah, I wanna hold you close

Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know

 Baby, remind me, remind me

 Do you remember the way it felt?
 You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
 Remind me
 Yeah, remind me

All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me


Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me

 Oh, baby, remind me

 Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
 Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
 Remind me, yeah, oh
 Baby, remind me
