There goes my baby
Moving on down the line
Wondering where, wondering where
He is bound

I broke his heart
And made him cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do

Just wanna know
Does he love me
Does he really love me
Or is he just playing
Me for a fool

I wonder why he left me
Why did he leave me so all alone
So all alone

I was gonna tell him that I loved him
And that I need him
Beside my side
To be my guide

I wanna know
Where is my baby
I want my baby
I need my baby

I was gonna tell him that I loved him
And that I need him

Beside my side
To be my guide

I wanna know where is my
Where is my baby
I need my baby
I need my baby
