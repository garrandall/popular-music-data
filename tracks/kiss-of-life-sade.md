There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the color of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you 
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say 

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay ay ay
You wrapped me up in
The color of love 

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of Life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life 

Wasn't it clear from the start
Look the sky is full of love
Yeah the sky is full of love
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say 

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of Life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life 

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of Life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life 

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of Life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life 

You wrapped me up in the color of love
Must have been an angel come down from above
Giving me love yeah
Giving me love yeah 

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of Life
You gave me the kiss of life
The kiss of life
