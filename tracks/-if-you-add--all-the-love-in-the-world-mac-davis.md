If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope

Nothing that's grown from love alone
Could ever see the bad side
They're on the right side of love
Completely

And some people live by love alone
Others live by hate
Me, I just stay in between
'Cause I know

If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
There'll still be some love left over

And if you add all the times that you heal
Take away all the times that you don't
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope

If you've got a plan for living, man
You better get things moving
Or you'll be losing your way to freedom

And some people tell the world about love
And others just say nothing
Me, I just stay in between
'Cause I know

If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
There'll still be some love left over

And if you add all the times that you heal
And take away all the times that you don't
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope

If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
