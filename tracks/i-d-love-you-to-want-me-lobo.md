When I saw you standing there
I'bout fell off my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet

Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you made
For the title that they gave

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

Oh baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
