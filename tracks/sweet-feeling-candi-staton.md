You picked me up
Oh, yes you did
When nobody else would
I know you did

And you did things
For me, my baby
That nobody else could
I know you did

You gave me your heart
But I couldn't be true
But I still got that
Same sweet feeling for you
Sweet baby, mmm

We had a love
Oh, yes, we did
Beyond compare
I know we did

And when I needed you
Oh, Lordy
You were always there
I know you were

I had my chance
But I couldn't come through
Now I still got that
Same sweet feeling for you
Sweet baby, oh, yeah

I got that feeling
When I hear your name
That old lonesome feeling
Keep coming back again

I get that feeling
And I cry out in the night
I need you, baby, oh, darling
To say everything's all right

Come back, baby, oh, yeah
Where you belong
I hope you will

Please forgive me
Oh, darling
For doing you wrong
I hope you will

I'm so sorry for all
The pain I put you through
But I still got that
Same sweet feeling for you
Sweet baby, mmm

I got that feeling
Everything I do
I get that feeling
For nobody but you

Sometime in the midnight hour
I get so lonesome
I need you, baby
I need you, baby

I need you, baby
To stay right here by my side
I need you, baby...
