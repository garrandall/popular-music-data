You call me up at two in the morning
Honey ya burnin' up the telephone wire
You say you can't wait 'til tomorrow
And that you need me to put out your fire

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
You sure want a lot for your dime
Then you talk so, so sweet and dirty
You drive me right out of my mind
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got

I swear that every time is the last time
'Cause I know there ain't no future in this
And then from the heart of the darkness
Comes that call that I can never resist

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
Why can't you leave me some pride
Then you whisper 'cause baby I need you
And I go all to pieces inside
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got

Come and get it
Come and get it

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
Why can't you leave me some pride
Then you whisper 'cause baby I need you
And it tears me all to pieces inside
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got
