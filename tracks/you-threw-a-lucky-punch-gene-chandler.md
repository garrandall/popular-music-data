That day, oh, yeah
When you walked away
I wanted to call you back
But I didn't know what to say

But when you said you had to part
Something hit, hit me all at once
Love walked right in
And caught me by suprise

Cause you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Oh, girl
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
That's right
You threw a lucky punch

Baby, baby
When I saw you, huh, uh huh
For the very first time
I wanted, wanted to love you
And leave you behind

Until you put me down
I had won every round
But something hit
Hit me all at once
Girl, I never thought you
Log on to kill this message
Would open my nose

But you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Oh, girl
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You threw a lucky punch

Since I loved you
Let me prove my love is true
And love you tender
Oh, please, baby, surrender
I've been a playboy, it's true
But I'm hanging up my heart for you

So I guess I'll wait around
Tears falling down
Hoping you'd change your heart
And realize I need you by my side

Cause you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Oh, girl
You hit me in my heart
(You threw a lucky punch)
That's right

Come on, it was a TKO
You made me love you so
You hit me left, right, left
Knocked me down...
