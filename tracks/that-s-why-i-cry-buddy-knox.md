'Cause you're the sweetest
Girl in the world
That's why I cry

Yes, you're the sweetest
Girl in the world
That's why I cry

I thought our love was settled
True as it could be
But on the sly, another guy
Took your love from me
Yes, on the sly, another guy
Took your love from me

You've got the warmest
Love in the world
That's why I cry

You've got the warmest
Love in the world
That's why I cry

Now my mind is troubled
Like an angry sea
'Cause on the sly, another guy
Took your love from me
Yes, on the sly, another guy
Took your love from me

Took your love from me
Took your love from me
Took your love from me
Took your love from me
