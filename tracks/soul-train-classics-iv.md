Listen to me, baby the lights are way down low
There's a stack of records on the stereo
Let yourself unwind, girl we're gonna take a journey down to rhythm and blues
Ridin' on a soul train, yeah baby just-a me and you

You don't have to hurry on a soul train ride
You don't have to worry let your troubles slide
Dancin' to the music, maybe we can travel till we're out of sight
Yeah, and everything'll be all right

Groovin' slow and easy, just takin' our time
We ain't goin' nowhere, for baby I don't mind
So put your arms around me we're gonna take a journey down to rhythm and blues
Ridin' on a soul train, yeah baby just-a me and you

Ridin' on a soul train, baby
Oh, ridin' on a soul train, yeah
