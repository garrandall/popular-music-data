Memories of you and me
Tumble inside my head
The way that we used to be
Things that we said

No one has ever made me believe so strong
You left me to wonder
How did our love go wrong


Angelia
Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn around

I lie awake at night
Wait for the sun to shine
I still feel you next to me
Your lips on mine

Without a warning
You made our love a lie
You said you were sorry
But you never told me why



Maybe my love is in vain
Maybe you're the hurting kind
Can't take no more of this pain
I've got to get you off my mind

Tried to be what you wanted
I gave you all I had
You left me without nothin'
Nothin' but a photograph
