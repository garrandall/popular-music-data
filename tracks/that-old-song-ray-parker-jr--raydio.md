A good song and a love affair
Go hand in hand together
When you think you've gotten over one
The other holds on to your forever

I've tried hard to forget (To forget love)
Ever lovin' you
But just when I've convinced myself
It's over with, then I hear

That old song that they used to play (That old song)
On the radio just about every day
And whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you

That old song that they still play (That old song)
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody (Melody)
Remindin' me how in love we used to be

I shouldn't be tellin' you this
I know that I'm out of place (Out of place)
But when I love another woman
I can still see your face, baby

Maybe this is a sign for us (We should get back)
To try and get back together
You can't imagine that those memories (Those memories)
Do to me every time I hear

That old song that they used to play (That old song)
On the radio just about every day
Whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you

That old song that they still play (That old song)
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody (Melody)
Remindin' me how in love we used to be

(That old song)
Think of you and me
Every time I hear that song

I recall the good times
When I hear that song, that song, that song
Makin' me realize
That I want you back, girl

Every time I hear that song (Keep on playin' that old song)
Keep on playin' that old song
Oh, when I hear that song (Keep on playin' that old song)
It reminds me of a love so strong, mmm

Mr. DJ, would you please play (Keep on playin' that old song)
That old song
Help me bring my baby back home (Keep on playin' that old song)
Keep on playin', playin' that old song

Ba-de-ah-ba-de-ah
Ba-de-ah-ba-de-ah-ah-ah
