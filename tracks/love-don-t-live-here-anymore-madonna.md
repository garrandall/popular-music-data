You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore


When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Troubles seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby


You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore


Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before you went away
Found another place to stay, another home


You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore


In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?


You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
