We met in a bar
Out on Chesapeake Bay
With her white patent boots
And her blouse red lame
A table top dancer
She would smile on cue
Those lips of an angel
Angel in blue

She's been dancing for ages
Though cities of bars
She was kickin' the habit
Of scoring in cars
She'd been drained of her spirit
All caged in this zoo
A wildcat angel
Angel in blue

And as she stared out into nowhere
I thought, yes, I thought she might break down and cry
When I whispered I thought I could love her
She just said "Baby, don't even bother to try"

And I watched as she spoke
Her words chilled my bones
All her friends did her favors
That were really just loans
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
The palest of angels
Angel in blue

And the bees they had stung her
The birds they had flown
There were guys she could number
But none she had known
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
My fade away angel
Angel in blue
