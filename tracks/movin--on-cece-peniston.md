Why'd you think that I
Would sit here and wait in vain?
Baby, I'm movin' on
'Cause what I want from love
Is the pleasure and not the pain
Baby I'm movin' on


Didn't I hear you say
That your love would never change
But I know that it's over
But when the story ends
Why should we both pretend
When we know there's another


Tell me how, tell me who
Just tell me the truth
Tell me why did you lie
I can see it in your eyes
Tell me where, tell me when
Cause it never should have been at all
But it looks like it's over

I remember when
When I was there for you
Where were you last winter?
Cause the thoughts run through my mind
Of all the times you lied
And that's why it's over

How could you do this to me?
'Cause now I gotta leave
Why did you tell me those lies?
And now I gotta say bye bye
Bye bye, baby yeah



Where'd we go wrong?
Now, you left me all alone
Hey, but it's alright 'cause I'm movin' on
Yes I am
Baby, I'm movin' (baby, I'm movin')
Baby, I'm movin' (baby, I'm movin')
Baby, I'm movin', movin', oh, baby I am movin' on
Baby I am...
