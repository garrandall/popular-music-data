Did you see any action?
Did you make any friends?
Would you like some affection
Before I leave again?

I've been walking behind you
Since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason
For you to think about me

Did you have any bad dreams?
Did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion?
Is there even a chance?

You've been talking in circles
Since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason
For ever telling me why, yeah, yeah

Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Bring a good feeling ain't had in such a long time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time

Have you ever been lonely? Do you have any fun?
Do you ever think of me? I'm just no one, yeah
You never give me no answer, you never tell me the truth
There's never been any reason
For me to think about you
There's never been any reason
There's never been any reason, yeah
There's never been any reason

Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Don't you know she could bring a good feeling
Ain't had in such a long time?
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Whoa
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
