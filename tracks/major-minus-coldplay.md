They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on


They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
No, don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear the crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on


You could hear them climbing the stairs
Got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on
