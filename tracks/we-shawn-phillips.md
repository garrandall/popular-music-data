She is free, but she does not know the price she has to pay
And he could be a lover in the life she leads throughout the day
And they both could live together
They both could live in peace
They both could be in love together
And make the world at ease
Floating through a sea of troubles
That the world around them makes
And it really doesn't matter when you know love's pattern
Because you know that is all it takes

And she could be a mother and a daughter at the same time for a man
And he could be a father and a son for her future family plan
And they could raise a lot of healthy children yeah
Bring 'em up in harmony
And teach them all the good things in this life
But most important teach them how to be
Open and attentive and loving
When the world around them shakes
And it really doesn't matter when you know love's pattern
Because you know that is all it takes

She is thee, she's every woman that's living in the world today
And he is me, and I'm looking for the woman that tells me she is free
And we all can live together
We all can live in peace
We all can be in love together
And make the world at ease
Working through a sea of troubles
That the world around us makes
And it really doesn't matter when you know love's pattern
Because you know that is all it takes
