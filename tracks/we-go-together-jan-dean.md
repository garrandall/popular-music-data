We go together like castles and kings
Birds of a feather? robins in spring

Let's go steady
You are my first love
We like the same things
That makes livin' so sweet
Lovin' midnight movies
In the balcony seats

Let's go steady
You are my first love
So please, listen to me
Someday we will be
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band

We go together like two straws in a coke
Why not come over and you'll meet my folks?

Let's go steady
You are my first love
(So please, listen to me
Someday we will be)
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band

I love you so
We go together like straws in a coke
Why not come over
And you'll meet my folks?

Let's go steady
You are my first love
First love
You are my first love
