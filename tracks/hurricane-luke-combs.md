Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in

I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane

You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes
Over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again

If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And, girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
