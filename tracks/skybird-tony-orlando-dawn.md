Skybird, my bird
We fly so high and then
You touch me warm and fly again

And leave me, let down
Earthbound, left standing on the ground
Looking through the clouds for a trace of you

Heaven have you seen a sign of Skybird?
She's somewhere flyin' in your blue
You've got all the stars, so why'd you take my bird?
Oh, send her home, I'll make her heaven too

One day, maybe
You'll come to rest a-while
And I'll be the nest you'll fly back home to

'Til then, again
I'll watch you come and go
Feeling lost until the day I found you

Heaven have you seen a sign of Skybird?
She's somewhere flyin' in your blue
You've got all the stars, so why'd you take my bird?
Oh, send her home, I'll make her heaven too

Til then, again
I'll watch you come and go
Feeling lost until the day I found you

Heaven have you seen a sign of Skybird?
She's somewhere flyin' in your blue
You've got all the stars, so why'd you take my bird?
Oh, send her home, I'll make her heaven too

Heaven have you seen a sign of Skybird?
She's somewhere flyin' in your blue
You've got all the stars, so why'd you take my bird?
