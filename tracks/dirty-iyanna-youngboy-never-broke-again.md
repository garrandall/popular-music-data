You’ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never will leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, "That’s okay"
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark
I see she won't leave me ‘lone
She sliced the tires on my car


Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, no
Dirty Iyanna


Forever we get it, I'm sick of these bitches, they flow in my head, ah
We be chasing the riches, however you want it
Aim straight for the head, ah
And she know that I love her, she want me to cuff her
I think she’ll hurt me, I never will let her
I'm sending condolences inside of a letter
Still trappin' like Griselda
No, it ain't safe in these streets, all alone, ah
No, we don't play, keep that heat, we take his soul, ah
Even though when I’m wrong, I ain't never gon' lie
If I feel that I owe you, I'm gon' make it right
I'll be thuggin' and keepin' my head to the sky
Double back on a lap by myself and I cry
In the bed while I'm dreaming behind you I die
Before that can happen, I let off that fire
Trappin' and rappin', we shoot to the top
After I'm asking "Can we have a child?"
After heartbreak, I’ll cut off relations
But I be thinkin' 'bout you on the daily
Tell my niggas what up and they said that I'm crazy
Remember wit' you all them hoes, they hatin'


Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, no
Dirty Iyanna, Dirty Iyanna
(Iyanna, Iyanna)
Dirty Iyanna
