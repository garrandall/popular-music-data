Wish they hadn't seen you walk away
And heard me beg you "Stay, please stay"
Why, why did we choose this crowded place
They all know it, 'cause I show it in my face

Everybody knows you said goodbye
Everybody knows we're through
Now they all can see the tears I cry
Running down my face for you

They all said it's too good to be true
It'll make a fool of you one day
I just laughed and said our love was strong
But you left me and they all know I was wrong

Everybody knows you're tired of me
Everybody knows we're through
Though I'm on my own I can't be free
Baby, I just live for you

Everybody knows you said goodbye
Everybody knows we're through
Now they all can see the tears I cry
Running down my face for you

Everybody knows you're tired of me
Everybody knows we're through
Though I'm on my own I can't be free
Baby, I just live for you
