In the midnight sky
Count every rose
Every firefly

For that's how
Many times I miss you
Heaven knows I miss you

Count every leaf
On a willow tree
Count every wave
On a stormy sea

Count every star and
Darling, when you do
You'll know the times
I have cried for you

Count every leaf
On a willow tree
Count every wave
On a stormy sea

Count every star and
Darling, when you do
You'll know the times
I have cried for you
