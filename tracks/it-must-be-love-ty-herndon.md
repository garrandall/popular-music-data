I just dropped her off, I'm thinking "Oh what a night"
I ought to be flying but I'm sittin here at this green light
I thought I was in control, thought I knew where I wanted to go
She's got me turned inside out, I'm wonderin' what it's all about

Is she there in your dreams? I don't know, I can't sleep
Is she breaking your heart? Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
Does she know how you feel? It's right on the tip of my tongue
Are you walking on air? Well I'm sure feeling tall
Does she trouble your mind? It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love.

I just missed my turn, guess I'm not thinking straight
Oh and what's with this car, it's driving me back to her place
I'm out here circling around, I've already covered this ground
These feelings just can't be denied, so what am I trying to decide

Is she there in your dreams? I don't know, I can't sleep
Is she breaking your heart? Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
Does she know how you feel? It's right on the tip of my tongue
Are you walking on air? Well I'm sure feeling tall
Does she trouble your mind? It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love.

Is she there in your dreams? I don't know, I can't sleep
Is she breaking your heart? Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
Does she know how you feel? Oh It's right on the tip of my tongue
Are you walking on air? Well I'm sure feeling tall
Does she trouble your mind? It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love.

I don't know but something tells me 
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love
I don't know but something tells me
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love.
