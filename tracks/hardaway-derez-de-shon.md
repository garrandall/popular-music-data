Derez De'shon (yeah)
This is the remix
I got dreams of livin' lavish, in the kitchen whippin' magic
DJ Envy, Derez De'shon
I got dreams of livin' lavish, in the kitchen whippin' magic (bad, bad)
Yo Gotti, 2 Chainz
Bad bitches, bad habits
We got London on da Track
Yeah


I ain't asked nan' nigga for none', I had to grind for it (word)
Ain't battle rappin' none of these niggas, ain't got time for it (nah)
My homies gon' bust for me, I'm livin' luxury, rockin' this Tom Ford
Mama lil neck throw the Hardaway (Penny)
I went bought a Audemaur today (plain) (Envy)
I was sellin' cocaina, I was in the dope boy demeanor
Yeah, I fell in love with the white girl (white girl), on the first day that I seen her (yeah)
Dirty money, put it in the cleaner, big head hunter like Gina
Chopper bullets goin' back and forward like a nigga playin' tennis
Must be Venus and Serena, yeah
In refrigerator, nothin' to eat, I'ma go starve today (go starve today)
Lookin' like Trayvon but I got a big gun and I'ma go rob today (I was robbin')
Tried to tell them people I'm just a rapper but they wanna investigate me
Bump into one of these niggas and slap 'em, don't underestimate me
I was sellin' dope when I was 12 (12), always had hate for the 12 (12)
I was out late night tryna get to it, you had to be in before 12 (12)
Biggest nigga ever came out the city, other than Hardaway
Why they trade Z-Bo to the Kings?
Took the team, took the city heart away


I ain't asked nan' nigga for none', I took the harder way (I took the harder way)
12 pulled me over, caught me with the dope, they took my hard away (they took my hard away)
Pourin' liquor for my niggas that's gone, thug holiday (thug holiday)
Young Penny Hardaway (yeah), Hardaway, yeah
I ain't asked nan' nigga for none', I took the harder way (harder way) (this is the remix)
12 pulled me over, caught me with the dope, they took my hard away (they took my hard away) (this is the remix)
Hardaway (Hardaway), Hardaway (Hardaway)
Hardaway (Hardaway), young Penny Hardaway


I'm number one like I'm Penny, I used to shop JC Penney (yeah, yeah)
Now I go fuck up in Lenox, spend a few hundreds on Penny's (yeah, yeah)
Ever since I can remember, since elementary, all I wanted was millions
I used to steal from my grandmama change drawer just to flex on them lil bitty bitches, I be like (uh)
I be out after the streetlight (yeah), these niggas ain't 'bout that street life (no)
My block was hot before Lil Wayne was Tunechi, I ain't even kiss my baby g-night (mwah)
Before Tity Boi had turned to 2 Chainz, yeah


2 Chainz, I'm a livin' legend, I been buckin' seven
I don't fuck with 12, I don't even drive a 911
Treat the Panamera like a peasant
Nigga wanna ball with me, I hit 'em with the hesi'
Plain jane Rollie, this a Prezi
Out in SoHo, I done sold residue
It's the incredible, it's the inevitable
You done tricked these folks, talkin' 'bout things that you would never do (true)
Feds did a sweep in the A, they took the squad away
I was sellin' bags of Irene, right where my mama stay
I ain't never had to fabricate, auntie been locked up since '88
I know I'm the bomb, watch me detonate
I'm the best rapper up out the A
Used to sell bags but I graduated
I got the trap on my resume
I got the crib with the pool and the lake and the gate
With the yard that's too big to rake
Turned up a notch and I elevate, I got a new album on the way
Rap or go to the league, what I'm really sayin' is that ain't the only way


I ain't asked nan' nigga for none', I took the harder way (I took the harder way) (yeah, tell 'em)
12 pulled me over, caught me with the dope, they took my hard away (they took my hard away) (skrrt, alright)
Pourin' liquor for my niggas that's gone, thug holiday (thug holiday)
Young Penny Hardaway (yeah), Hardaway, yeah (Southside, yeah)
I ain't asked nan' nigga for none', I took the harder way (harder way) (2 Chainz)
12 pulled me over, caught me with the dope, they took my hard away (they took my hard away)
Hardaway (Hardaway), Hardaway (Hardaway)
Hardaway (Hardaway), young Penny Hardaway


This is the remix
DJ Envy, Derez De'shon
Yo Gotti, 2 Chainz
