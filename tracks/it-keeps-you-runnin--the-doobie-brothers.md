Say, where you gonna go?
Girl, where you gonna hide?
You go on leavin' out your heart
And all it's sayin' down deep inside

From here I can feel your heartbeat
Oh, you got me all wrong
You ain't got no worry
You just been lonely too long

I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago
Oh, darlin'

It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin')
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin')
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (Well)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'

Oh, I know how you feel
Hey, you know I been there
But what you're keepin' to yourself
Oh, you know it just ain't fair

Are you gonna worry
For the rest of your life?
Why you in such a hurry
To be lonely one more night?

Well, I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago
Oh, darlin'

It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin', hey, yeah)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (I know it does, baby)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps your runnin')
