There's gonna be a big
Hootenanny, hootenanny
Everybody's gonna come along
All join in at the
Hootenanny, hootenanny
Sing a hooting, hollering song

Put on your hat
Put out the cat
Bring a little money
Cause you might need that

Throw out the blues
Kick off your shoes
Sing a little, sing a little
Make a little love a little

Bring a little honey to
The hootenanny, hootenanny
Everybody's gonna have a date
Hurry hurry, hurry to
The hootenanny, hootenanny
We don't wanna be late

You get the girls
I'll get the car
Bring a banjo and an old guitar
Get out the spoons
You know the tunes
Hey diddle diddle with
A fiddle in the middle

If you can't fiddle
At the hootenanny, hootenanny
Play a little paper and comb
Once you get to the
Hootenanny, hootenanny
You'll never wanna go home

You get the girls
I'll get the car
Bring a banjo and an old guitar
Get out the spoons
You know the tunes
Hey diddle diddle with
A fiddle in the middle

If you can't fiddle at the
Hootenanny, hootenanny
Play a little paper and comb
Once you get to the
Hootenanny, hootenanny
You'll never wanna go home
You'll never wanna go home
You'll never want to go home
