Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you


Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh


When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on


Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love


I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, oh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu


Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again


I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hm
