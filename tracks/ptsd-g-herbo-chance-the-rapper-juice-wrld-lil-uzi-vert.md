(DA got that... DA got that dope)

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I proved you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war-zone inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct
Shooting at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thang, tryna repeat
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it out the sun-roof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast for police
Shots fired back but his ass in the street
When I bought a.40, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lotta warfare, 17 had a.50 piece
Flexed on niggas, so you know they wanna kill a g
(Royalty)
Posted in the hood with some Bentley keys
(Loyalty)
Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean

I can't sleep 'cause it's a war-zone in my head
My killas good, they know I'm hands-on with the bread
A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry, seeing red
How the fuck I'm 'posed to have fun, all my niggas dead

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I proved you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war-zone inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

Used to run home from the train stop
Runnin so fast, dodgin' rain drops
'Member got robbed at the park once
'Member thinkin' that that bitch prolly ain't caught
'Member I was with my mama one time
Seen a nigga through the glass hit a nigga with a bank shot
Point blank, head hanging off his tank top
Walked off, we drove off, went to Gamestop
Quiet ride there, picked up 'San Andreas'
Certain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off
We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl
Conceal, don't reveal to the people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil
In case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out
Another homie went in his pockets
Please do not run up on me, not even as fans
Niggas get fanned down on the Dan Ryan
I'm flyin', I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan (Ah!)

The days seem longer as life gets shorter
We know sex, drugs, money, all in that order
Ain't no structure, no peace, we've lost our order
Leaving me with anxiety, fucking up my sobriety

It's a war-zone layin' inside of my head
I still think about all my niggas that's dead
I'm too paranoid, yeah, I know you heard what I said
I'm too paranoid, I made sure all my ops they bled

Draining all my energy
No, I cannot sleep, uh huh
I'm affected by the streets
No appetite, I can't eat
I only see red when I see
I think it's my PTSD
I think it's my PTSD
I think it's my PTSD, yeah

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
