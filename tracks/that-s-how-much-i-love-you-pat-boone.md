Well, if I had a nickel
I know what I would do
I'd spend it all on candy
And give it all to you
I'd spend it all on candy
And give it all to you
Cause that's how much
I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
And if you were a kitten
With pretty glossy fur
I'd pick you up and stroke you
And listen to you purr
I'd pick you up and stroke you
And listen to you purr
Cause that's how much
I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
And if you were a horsefly
And I an old gray mare
I'd stand and let you bite me
And never move a hair
I'd stand and let you bite me
And never move a hair
Cause that's how much
I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Well if you were a tiger
I'd hang around your den
I'd pester you, my honey
Until you let me in
I'd pester you, my honey
Until you let me in
Cause that's how much
I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Well, if you wanna marry
Now let me tell you what
We'll go and find a parson
And let him tie the knot
We'll go and find a parson
And let him tie the knot
Cause that's how much
I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
