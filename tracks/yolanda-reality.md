Excuse me sweet thing may I ask your name,
She said Yolanda and may I ask the same.
I said essential and can I make you mine?
But she played me to the left and the first thing hit my mind was:
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine.
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine.
That same night as I laid in bed,
Yolanda, Yolanda; all that was in my head.
So I tried to figure out on how to make her mine
And I'm thinking to myself that it's gonna take some time I said
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine.
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine.
Hey donada hey, hey donada hey Yolanda you look so fine.
Hey donada hey, hey donada hey Yolanda you look so fine.
What I need is a damn good program,
Essential, essential don't play yourself my man,
But she's driving me crazy and I just can't understand,
Yolanda, Yolanda I've got to be your man
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine
Oh yeah, yeah oh ee Yolanda, oh yeah, yeah you look so fine.
Yo Yolanda why you frontin the moves step to reality get with the groove
It's the cool rock steady, I wanna work you girl make your body sweaty.
But you keep playing the role, yo Yolanda why you got me on hold?
Give me a chance this time we can talk, relax then wine & dine
I hope you know that I'm crazy about you
I brag all the time about you to the crew.
Let me explain Yolanda to the world she's my just one type of girl.
You can find her hangin out in the clubs

And oh yeah, by the way she's the best. Yolanda is fresh!
