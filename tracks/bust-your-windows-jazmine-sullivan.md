I bust the windows out your car
And no it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you'll see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crow bar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car
You should feel lucky that that's all I did
After five whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you'll see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

I bust the windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until that happens, baby, you don't know pain
Yea, I did it, you should know it
I ain't sorry, you deserved it
After what you did you deserved it
I ain't sorry, no
You broke my heart, so I broke your car
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt, yea
Oh, but why am I still crying?
Why am I the one who's still crying?
Oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby
You really, you really hurt me, babe

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Now watch me you
Now watch

I bust the windows out your car
