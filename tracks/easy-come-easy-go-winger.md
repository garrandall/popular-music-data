If you start to feel like there's no time to waste
Baby, try to let go - there's
Nothing that strong - can't break your heart
Easy Come Easy Go

And the only only only way you find it...

Is if you're not digging too deep
Though it's easier said than done
You've got to feel it in your blood
Play the game like you've already won

And you only only only own it when you say...

Easy Come Easy Go
This won't break my heart don't you know
Sometimes high, sometimes low
Easy Come Easy Go

You fell in a trap that won't let you win
You try again and again
You let the heat burn your feet
Baby try to understand that you

Only only only own it when you say...



So if you start to feel like there's no time to waste
Baby try to let go - there's
Nothing that strong - can't break your heart
Sometimes high, sometimes low

And you only only only own it when you say...
