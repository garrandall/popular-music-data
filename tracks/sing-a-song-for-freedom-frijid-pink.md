Everybody's gotta get a job together
Take it back all the way

Don't' think about tomorrow
Just think about today
Before dawn, understand
In this world, everybody's free
Forget about your troubles and worries
And take a good look at me

Sing a song for children
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for freedom
Sing a song for me

Everybody's gotta get a job together
Take it back all the way
Don't' think about tomorrow
Gotta gotta gotta think about today
Before dawn, understand
In this world, everybody's free
Forget about your troubles and worries
And take a good look at me

Sing a song for children
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for freedom
Sing a song for me

(Sing a song for freedom)
Everybody sing a song
(Sing a song for me)
I've got to sing a song for me now
(Sing a song for freedom)
Freedom, freedom
(Sing a song for me)
Everybody, gotta listen to my song baby
(Sing a song for freedom)
(Sing a song for me)

(Sing a song for freedom)
Sing a song for freedom
(Sing a song for me)
Everybody everybody

Freedom, freedom
(Sing a song for freedom)
(Sing a song for me)
Freedom, freedom

(Sing a song for me)

Everybody gotta sing a song for me
Yeah yeah yeah
