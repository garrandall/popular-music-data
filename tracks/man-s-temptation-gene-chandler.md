One more time to test
The willpower of me
This feeling that I hold now
Just won't let me be
This woman won't leave me alone
She's going to ruin my happy home
With a man's temptation
Well, I've got another back home
Who's the beat in my heart
I never thought that no one else
Could ever tear us apart
To each other, we had been so true
Until along comes a lover like you
With a a man's temptation
I know I've got to be strong
I've got to fight this all alone
So afraid for what I must do
I've got to hurt my woman or you
But I've got a feeling telling me
Let your heart be your guide
I don't want lose either one
Which makes it hard to decide
Though my mind continues to roam
Oh, baby, my heart, it stays at home
And controls my temptation
I'm sorry, little miss
That's the way love is
I'm sorry I can't stay
I must be on my way
