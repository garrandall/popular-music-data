I'm a robin sitting in a tree
Singing for you, darling, endlessly
Inspiration's got a hold on me
And I don't want to be set free

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

You're a party with the lights down low
You're my Friday night movie show
Love me tender on the radio
Just hold me tight and don't let go

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

People fall in love and
All too soon it fades away
But, sweet darling, we won't fade
I will travel with you on down the line

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you

It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
