It's much too groovy a summer's day
To waste runnin' 'round in the city
But here on the sand I can dream away
Or look at the girls if they're pretty

It's a turn-down day
Nothing on my mind
It's a turn-down day
And I dig it

There's nothing easier I can do
Than lying around doing nothing

It's a turn-down day
Just a turn-'round day
It's a turn-down day
And I dig it

Soft summer breeze and the surf rolls in
Through laughter of small children playing
Someone's radio has the news tuned in
But nobody cares what he's saying

Don't you know, it's a turn-down day
Nothing on my mind
It's a turn-down day
And I dig it

Things that are waiting to mess my mind
Will just have to wait 'til tomorrow

It's a turn-down day
Just a turn-'round day
It's a turn-down day
And I dig it

It's a turn-down day
Nothing on my mind
It's a turn-down day
Just a turn-'round day
It's a turn-down day
