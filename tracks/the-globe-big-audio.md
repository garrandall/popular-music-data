Break it on down
Bless you
(Whoo)
Bless you
(Whoo)
Oh bless you
(Whoo)
Bless you

Where are you going
My beautiful friend
Is this the road that
We take 'til the end
And if we break down
Are we left behind
Is this the highway
Of all mankind

Axis spins so round and round we go
Where we're goin no one really knows
Here we here we here we here we go
Feel the fire way down below

Come on and dim the lights
(It's party time)
Switch on the strobe
(Do what you like)
We gonna have a ball tonight
(Let's have a ball)
Down at the Globe

(Time to look at ?)
Come on dim the lights
(Here we here we here we go again)
Switch on the strobe
(Lookin right ?)
Gonna have a ball tonight
(All I see is ?)
Down at the Globe

Get up and clean your teeth and have a shave
It's 1 am let's go out to a rave
One more in before we hit that grave
It's hotter than a microwave wave

(Chorus)

(Lift it on up, lift it on up)

(Chorus)

(I am the fisherman
On me way to the garden party at the palace
Where's the party, officer?)

(Chorus)

(Here we go one time break it on down)

Where is the failure
Not in this land
But still you try to
Get what you can
You know that it's bad but
If you insist
Here's one more chance now
That you just missed

Chorus

(I believe you, I believe you)

(Chorus)

(A'waking up the global warming way
Napalm cornflakes for my Special K
What's the health department got to say?
Don't smoke more than fifty fags a day)

(Chorus)

(C'mon, party on down)

(Chorus)
