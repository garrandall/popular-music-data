Ohhhh!

Love's fever
Coming on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talking pressures or material gains

But M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I'll never understand what people's heads are in
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time just will do

(Just a little lovin' this will do)

Just a little love

(Just a little lovin' this will do)

Na na na na

(Just a little lovin this will do)

L-O-V-E love

(Just a little lovin me and you)

Love's coming so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without you're rhyme no
Easy feeling 'oh your love keeps getting better

Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

But M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my bones that you and I can win oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
And just a little time this will do

(Just a little lovin this will do)

Just a little love

(Just a little lovin' this will do)

La na na na la la

(Just a little lovin' this will do)

La na na na na na na

(Just a little lovin this will do)

'Cause M-O-N-E-Y
Never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my third eye our love will never end oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
In just a little time
I need your lovin'
Yeah!
I need your lovin'
In just a little time this will do
Baby me and you yeah
I just need your lovin'

(Just a little lovin' this will do)
(Just a little lovin me and you)
