I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do


All those days and lonely nights
Have all gone away
I never thought the day would come
When we'd be more than friends
You made me smile when I was down
And turned my world around
The way you give me love
Feels so right
(Oh)


You took the ease off my mind
And put it behind
You were there for all my needs
So, baby
Stay


I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do


Just like a dream come true
I wished for you
I have never been so happy 'bout a love so new
You opened my heart to a brand new start
My love's there
Wherever you are
I won't let no one take you away


You took the ease off my mind
And put it behind
You were there
Yes, indeed
For all my needs
(Yes, you were, babe)


I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do


Cause you came along and changed my life
Told me things would be alright
And they were
Thanks to you
(Babe, babe, thanks to you)
And now I have the strength to carry on
In my heart
You have a home
And I never want to be alone
Cause I love me


I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
