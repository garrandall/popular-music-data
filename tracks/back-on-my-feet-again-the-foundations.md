Yeh
Yeh
Yeh
You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

In my life there has been nobody
Who ever cared a bit about me
I was the one guy deserving love
But every time it seemed to be found
I was the one guy really hurt in love
Who ended up flat on the ground (flat on the ground)

You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Tried so hard to take it cool and easy
But everything seems to go wrong
I was the one guy, believed in love
Who seemed to have some kind of knack
To be the one guy, deceived in love
Who ended up flat on his back (straight on his back)

You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Cause you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
