The loneliest night of the week
Twenty-four hours of misery
Can't go to bed cause there's no sleep
On the loneliest night of the week

The loneliest night of the week
So many tears, I can't see
Don't you know I miss you so
On the loneliest night of the week

We had so much fun
And the things we done
All that's gone for me

Now comes the time
That you must leave
Now that lonely will
Always be with me

The loneliest night of the week
Twenty-four hours of misery
Can't go to bed cause there's no sleep
On the loneliest night of the week
