Ain't no magician, no miracle maker
I am the shoreline, you are the breaker
All I can say if this life that we're living
Is a death-defying thrill

I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill

If there's a chance, then I'll take my chances
No awkward steps
And no sideway glances
I have the spirit, I'll never be broken
And know inside myself

I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill

Well maybe you think that I'm overconceited
But I've made my stand and I won't be defeated
It's never too late you know until you stop trying
Just say to yourself

(I Have The Skill)
I believe
(I Have The Skill)
If there's a chance I'll take it
And I know

I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill

(I Have The Skill)
I believe
(I Have The Skill)
If there's a chance I'll take it
I know

I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill

It's easy
And I know inside myself

(I Have The Skill)
I believe
(I Have The Skill)
If there's a rule I'll break it
I know

I Have The Skill
I Have The Skill
