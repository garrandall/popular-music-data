Lemme see you
Get it low, to the floor
Baby no, don't rush
Once you get it on
I'mma get you home
I'mma Put it on


Oh, she's just my type (Flocka)
Hair long and her eyes light
Her smile shine like the sunlight
One of a kind, baby momma type
Friend mugging, she the hater type
Waka Flocka, I'm the player type (Flex)
Jewelry bright, winter white
Champagne chilled on ice
Hold up!
Every bad bitch in the club to the dance floor
Hands on your hips, get real low
Throwing money, my M.O
So slot me your info
Let me know, what you doing tonight girl
I ain't got time for no games
I'm only here for tonight girl

Lemme see you get low, low, low
To the floor floor floor
Grab your hips girl
Fuck your man
Gimme some more more more




Ride for him
Cause he say I ride real good
Pop star, but I fuck him like I'm still hood
Heard he wanna spend money on a red bitch
Wanna see me do tricks with the next chick
Anyway, boobs up and my ass out
Somebody get a medic when he pass out
Big Nicki in the game nigga
Bricksquad, I ain't fucking with no lame nigga (ah)
Dis dat part when I slow it down like this (ah)
Somebody better get da bitch another round (ah)
Fly as fuck I need a co-pilot
When I come out it's a motherfucking whore riot

They your size, little waist don't match your thighs
Say you're on my level but my level too high
Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised
I know you ain't heard that, before
Searching in the club and I just found one
Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my fun
So what's up, to the bad bitch
In the corner, with her ass big
And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard
Like, I ain't tryna be horse & carriage
Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit
I just wanna smash it, smash it
Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is
But first lemme see you...


Lemme see you
Get it low, to the floor
Baby no, don't rush
Once you get it on
I'mma get you home
I'mma Put it on

You be like (oh oh), wrap your legs around (me, me)
I'll be on top of (you, you), you'll be like (oh oh)
I'll be like (oh oh), wrap your legs around (me, me)
I'll be on top of (you, you), I'll be on top of (oh oh)

 x2

You be like (oh oh), wrap your legs around (me, me)
I'll be on top of (you, you), you'll be like (oh oh)
I'll be like (oh oh), wrap your legs around (me, me)
I'll be on top of (you, you), I'll be on top of (oh oh)


Get Low!
To da floor!
Baby no.. don't rush!
Get it on!
Get ya home!
Put it on ya!
