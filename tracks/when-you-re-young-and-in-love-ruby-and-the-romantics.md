Spring's in the air
There's magic everywhere
When you're young and in love

The moon at night
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love
(Young and in love)

Each night seems just like the Fourth Of July
When stars spangle in the sky

Dreams can come true
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love

Trust and you'll find
There's no mountain you can't climb
When you're young and in love
(Young and in love)

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love an conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love
Young and in love

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love an conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love

Young and in love
(Young and in love)
Young and in love
(Young and in love)
Young and in love
(Young and in love)
Young and in love
(Young and in...)
