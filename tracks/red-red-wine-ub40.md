Red red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so

Red red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue heart

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

Red red wine you make me feel so fine
You keep me rocking all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollars when you're just in my hand
Red red wine, you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go, it makes me feel bad
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
Red red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing, you make me do my own thing
Red red wine, you give enough of love
You're kind of loving like a blessing from above
Red red wine, I loved you right from the start
Right from the start, with all of my heart
Red red wine in an eighties style
Red red wine in a modern beat style

Yeah
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet deep line
The line broke, the monkey get chocked
Bunjah, ganjapani, little rubber boat
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you cause I know you love truth
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you 'till I die
Love you 'till I die and that's no lie
Red red wine, can't get you off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find
I'll surely find
Make no fuss, just stick with us

Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
The line broke, the monkey get chocked
Bunjah, ganjapani, little rubber boat

Red red wine, you give me not awful love
You're kind of loving like blessing from above
Red red wine, I loved you right from the start
Right from the start, with all of my heart
Red red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing, you make me do my own thing
Red red wine in an eighties style
Red red wine in a modern beat style
Yeah

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
You keep me rocking all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollars when you just in my hand
Red red wine, you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go
It make me feel bad
