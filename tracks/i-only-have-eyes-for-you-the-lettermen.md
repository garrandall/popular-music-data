Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I Only Have Eyes For You, Dear

The moon maybe high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I Only Have Eyes For You

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here
So am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I Only Have Eyes For You
