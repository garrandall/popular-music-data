Many years ago my dad said, 'Honey 
Lady Luck may never come your way 
If it's love you want not only money' 
This is what my daddy used to say 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Waitin' around for someone who can help you 
Oh, someone who can help you find your way 
Then if you think there's no one you can turn to 
Well, there's someone just a lookin' glass away 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Wishin' and hopin' for your fortune 
Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day 
(Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day)
If you're lookin' for some inspiration 
This is what my daddy used to say 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

(Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day)

Do-do-do 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself
