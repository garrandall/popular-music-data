1-2-3
Oh, that's how elementary
It's gonna be
C'mon, let's fall in love
It's easy (It's so easy)
Like takin' candy (Like takin' candy) from a baby

A-B-C (A-B-C)
Fallin' in love with you was
Easy for me (Easy for me)
And you can do it, too
It's easy (It's so easy)
Like takin' candy (Like takin' candy) from a baby

Baby, there's nothin' hard about love
Basically, it's as easy as pie
The hard part is livin' without love
Without your love, baby, I would die

(1-2-3)
(1-2-3)
It's easy (It's so easy)
Like takin' candy (Like takin' candy) from a baby, yeah

One and one are two (One and one are two)
I know you love me and oh, oh
How I love you (How I love you)
Don't try to fight it
'Cause it's easy (It's so easy)
Like takin' candy (Like takin' candy) from a baby, yeah

1-2-3 (1-2-3)
Oh, that's how elementary
It's gonna be (It's gonna be)
C'mon, let's fall in love

It's easy (1-2-3)
Oh, that's how elementary
