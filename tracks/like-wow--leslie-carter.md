Everything looks bright standing in your light
Everything feels right, what's left is out of sight
What's a girl to do? I'm feeling you
You're on my mind

I wanna be with you
'Cause when you're standing next to me, it's like wow
Ya know your kisses seem to set me free, it's like wow
And when we touch, it's such a rush, I can't get enough, it's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Should I hesitate when it feels this great?
Don't wanna make a big mistake
Don't wanna make ya think I'm playin' games
I'm just tryin' to say

I wanna be with you
'Cause when you're standing next to me, it's like wow
Ya know your kisses seem to set me free, it's like wow
And when we touch, it's such a rush, I can't get enough, it's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

I'm fascinated by your love, you know it's all I'm thinking of
Have I waited long enough? My mind and heart are all mixed up
Feeling higher than a cloud, all my senses are like wow
Ooh, hey, what it's like wow

Ooh, hey, what
You know it's all I'm thinking of

It's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

You know its all I'm thinking of
It's like wow, everything feels right
Everything feels right now
Like wow, everything looks bright

All my senses are like
Like wow, everything feels right
Baby baby baby
The way I'm feelin' you is like wow

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Ooh
