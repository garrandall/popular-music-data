My phys ed teacher's got me working too hard
Relax after school sitting out in the yard
Just me and my baby, I'm holding her hand
And then pop ding a ling, here comes that popsicle man

Orange, lemon, cherry and lime
Fudge, tutti frutti and a grape that's fine
Buy one for me and one for my chick
A lot of good eating on a popsicle stick

Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma, bama, ma, ma, ma
Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma
If you want to keep cool it does the trick
And it comes on a stick, uh, huh, huh, uh, huh, huh

Some people buy popsicles just for kicks
But me and my baby, we save the sticks
To keep brother and sister quiet as a mouse
We give them popsicle sticks to build a popsicle house

Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma, bama, ma, ma, ma
Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma
If you want to keep cool it does the trick
And it comes on a stick, uh, huh, huh, uh, huh, huh

So when you hear the bell go ding a ling
That's the popsicle man and he's the goody king
Save popsicle wrappers and before long
You'll win a phonograph to play this record on

Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma, bama, ma, ma, ma
Popsicle, bama, ma, ma, ma
If you want to keep cool it does the trick
And it comes on a stick, uh, huh, huh, uh, huh, huh
