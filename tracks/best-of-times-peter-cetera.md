Things get bad, times get tough
Everybody knows
You gotta be a little stronger
Just to have the things you need
Everybody knows
If you try a little harder
You're gonna live a whole lot longer

Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour
Going out and stayin' far too long


You got to believe in something
When you believe in something
These are the best of times
You got to have faith in someone
When you have faith in someone
These are the best of times

Don't give up, can't give in
Never lose a minute
It's a long hard road back from nowhere
Love is not what you take out
It's what you put back in it
Take you chance, there's no doubt
Everything will all work out

See my way, I know where I'm goin'
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up
I want it all as soon as I can
Right where I am
