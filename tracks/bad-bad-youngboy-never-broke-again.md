I got Hitman on the beat
AKel (Yes, sir)


YoungBoy came back like they left him for dead (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Coolin', rollin’, I told shawty, "Give me head" (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Yeah, YoungBoy is just rollin', yes, sir)


Shawty don't love me, you know I’ma treat her bad (Bad-bad)
I'm real right, hold yo' sticks tight, get yo' clique knocked with this cash
These niggas with me 4KTrey, they bust yo' ass (Bust yo')
Nigga, what it's hittin' like? It’s a stick fight, we gon’ bust until you smash
They want attention, then YoungBoy get you clapped at
Rollin' off them pills, it’s gon' go down, push yo' hat back
My niggas know they let off, they better clap back
Up in Cali with two gats, I need three more, see where the straps at (Yuh)
I need a pint, I won't go under, I’ll be leanin' 'til the morning
I'll face his dome, won't catch him slippin', creep up on him
I got all this money, don't mean nothin' and it ain't a question, I'ma dump it
So think twice before you dream of takin' somethin'
He hit the kill switch when he turnt up on them meds (Mm-mm)
He lose his mind and he put five on top yo' head
On them Xans he catch him walkin' like he dead
He don't give a fuck if it's his blood, he zip him, yeah (Mm-mm-mm)


YoungBoy came back like they left him for dead (Yeah, yeah, gon' air 'em through)
(I came back fixed, is he eternal? I did it dirty)
Coolin', rollin', I told shawty, "Give me head"
(Yeah, YoungBoy is just rollin', yes, sir)


Flexin' bad, hunnid grand cash in my pants make me bust yo' ass
All I do is hand it to my mans
Blow that glizzy, bitch nigga
Totin' the green flag, tryna-be-down ass nigga, uh
Wanna be YoungBoy, ol' clown ass nigga
4KTrey official
Shawty wanna top me, slime me down, yeah, nigga
Just like his brothers, I'ma leave that nigga dead (Dead-dead)
Terminate you bitches, hit yo' block and leave it red


YoungBoy came back like they left him for dead (Yeah, yeah, gon' air 'em through)
(I came back fixed, is he eternal? I did it dirty)
Coolin', rollin', I told shawty, "Give me head"
(Yeah, YoungBoy is just rollin', yes, sir)
YoungBoy came back like they left him for dead (Yeah, yeah, gon' air 'em through)
(I came back fixed, is he eternal? I did it dirty)
Coolin', rollin', I told shawty, "Give me head"
