Winkin' and Blinkin' and Nod one night
Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish
The old moon asked the three
Well we're going out fishing for Herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea
And some silver and gold have we
Said Winkin' and Blinkin' and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the Herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afeared are we
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Winkin' and Blinkin' and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream they dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
Winkin' and Blinkin' and Nod

Now Winkin' & Blinkin' are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee ones trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea
Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three
Winkin' and Blinkin' and Nod
