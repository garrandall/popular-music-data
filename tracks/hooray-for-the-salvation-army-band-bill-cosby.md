Here I am
I'm having quite the fun
Drinking wine
Got the chicks on the run

And just as I'm about
To make a little sin
The door's kicked open
And guess who walked in

Hey, hooray for
The Salvation Army Band
You know I love em
But they just don't understand

Hey, hooray for
The Salvation Army Band
You know I love em
But they just don't understand

They're trying to help the sinner
And that's before the sin begins

I was drinking hard
I broke away again
And it looked like
The Devil was gonna win

And just as I was taking
My drink into drunkeness
Guess who broke the bottle
And said, clean up that mess

Hooray for The Salvation Army Band
Playing that music, going around
Doing the best they can

I guess one day
I'll be able to stick right with em
But for this whole time
I'm trying to get away from em

I said for this whole time
I'm trying to get away from em
Get away from em

I was broke
My employment check had expired
I took me a job stealing tires

And just as I had four
Nice ones stacked up in a pile
Guess what music I heard
And guess who came along
And kinda give me a smile

Hooray for The Salvation Army Band
Playing that music
And doing the best they can
Hooray for The Salvation Army Band

(Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves
We shall come rejoicing
Bringing in the sheaves)

Oh, help me
Somebody please
Stop this silly man

Oh, take my hand
Oh, my little chickadee
I will abstain from all
Intake of alcoholic beverages
