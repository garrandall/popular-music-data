Oh why, oh why, oh why
You tell me l-l-l-lies
Never t-t-t-t-t think
That I woulda re-a-li-a-li-a-lize
Things you say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Will make you fay-ay-ay-ade away
b-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye
B-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye-bye (goodbye)

12 o'clock last night in a club
U an a girl do de rub-a-dub-dub
Short dress and long curly hair
Don't deny it cause I saw u dere
Step 1 mi did dede when you giv her di line
Step 2 me did dede when you looked so sincere
Step 3 mi did dede when you hold her close and
Tell her everything dat she waah fe fear
Why you play those games,
those g-g-g-games with me

Oh, oh, oh, oh no, no, no, no, no, no...
Oh why oh why oh why You tell me

That I woulda re-a-li-a-li-a-lize
Things you say-ay-ay-ay-ay
Will make you fay-ay-ay-ay-ade away
So b-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye
B-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye-bye (goodbye)

12 o'clock in a de afternoon
U come around wit di same old tune
Gwan on an on like say everything fin
When all di time me know sey a lie, you did a lie
Step 1 me did dede when u give her de kiss
Step 2 mi two eyes as me witness
Step 3 giv mi mi keys and exit please
Your day is done so u better move on
