It starts out with a kiss
Even though you're only friends
Now there's nothing wrong with this
But this is where his act begins

He'll hold you and tell you that's what love is for
Oh, but don't give in to him (don't give in to him)
No, don't give in to him (ah)
Cause he will only ask for more

You don't want to lose him
So you let him have his way
You don't dare refuse him
Because you know the price you'll pay

He's bragging that he's never lost before
So don't give in to him (don't give in to him)
No, no, don't give in to him (ah)
Cause he will only ask for more

Baby, don't give in to him (don't give in to him)
No, no, don't give in to him (ah)
Cause I'm the one who loves you more

No, no, don't give in to him (don't give in to him)
Please don't give in
