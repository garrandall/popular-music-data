Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
Don't know if they're true
Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
And they're all about you

I went away
But I came back today
You know what I heard
You know what they say

Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
Don't know if they're true
Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
And they're all about you

Not this time
Not with me
You had your fun
Now set me free

Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
Don't know if they're true
Keep hearing rumors 'bout you baby
And they're all about you

What goes on?
I really wanna know
What goes on?
I really wanna know

What goes on?
I really wanna know
What goes on?
I really wanna know
What goes on?
