Make love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am, uh!

C'mon
All you girls 'round the world
Lookin' for a guy who's a real go getter
Every guy grab a girl
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better

Everybody
You want it - I'm the one
I got it - I'm Mr. Fun
You need it - I'm Captain Cool, yeah
Come get it - And I've come for you C'mon

Don't call me Gigolo
Don't call me Cassanova
Just call me on the phone
And baby come on over
When you need someone
When you need someone to...

Make love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am, yeah
Make love like a man
Your kinda man
That's what I am

Every day, every night
Take her little heart 'til it beats like a hammer
Do it good, do it right
Crazy little girl gonna stutter 'n' stammer




Gimme some rock 'n' roll
Little bit of rock 'n' roll
It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
Little bit of rock 'n' roll

Little bit of love goes a long, long way
Gotta get it on if you really wanna get her
Never ever wait it's a little to late
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better

You want it- Yeah baby
I got it - Why not
You need it - Oh-oh
Come get it - Oh come on

Make love like a man
I'm a man, that's what I am baby
Make love like a man
I'm a man, that's what I am
Hey, get it while you can
I wanna be your man
Baby understand
I'm a mmmmmmmmmman!
Make love like a man
Oh, you love her like a man
She's gonna feel a lot better
And that's a fact!
