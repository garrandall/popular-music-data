How can I explain , I never meant to cause you pain?
I'm standin' out in the rain
Maybe you're thinking
Maybe it's a game, but I feel so all alone
I call but you're never home
I feelin' like your heart is gone

Tell me baby, tell me I'm wrong
Tryin' to make you understand
Just wanna be your man

Sugar Honey Ice tea
Honey, honey it gots to be sugar, sugar
Honey ice tea
Oooo baby ****I love sugar, sugar honey ice tea
Honey girl, honey
It's got to be sugar honey ice tea
****I love you, ****I love you
Now baby my next move is
I gotta get next to you
So then maybe I can prove
I'm the best man and you'll never want to lose me

I believe my lesson's learned
I won't leave a stone unturned
This time you won't get burned
Put you before all my concerns
Tryin' to make you understand
Just wanna be your man


I don't mean to have to cuss or fuss
When it comes to the two of us
Being without you is just too rough
A thousand other loves wouldn't be enough
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I need you here to make it alright
And every morning I need another taste
Please don't leave my love to waste

Pacino sex double-o Benzito playin' the lee-o
Candelight scene at Casalito's New York sections
Sex inside the delicatessen
Gets picturesqe and Sugar honey ice tea confessions
Moonlight stared wristwear Cartier Plus presidential suites
Diamond filled chandeliers
Supreme sippin champy
Playalicious baby the looker
Sugar honey ice tea shared
What up booger

Repeat first verse
