M.O.B.B. nigga yeah ahuh
Ugh yeah cmon now yeah yo yo

Aint no party once we crash the party
Imma squeeze shorty then vacate the party
You keep grillin i'll pump pump the shotty
Put you in the trunk then dump dump the body
Nigga you don't know you betta ask somebody
Ya'll get down we gonna clash prob'ly
Builty snowflake out of the ampacomby
I'm tryin to rip britney so I made ja sign me
Nigga catch me in tha club with a double lead banger
Im the wrong one to fuck with
Now I know the promoters I'm in with the musket
Pound of the haze and a box of dutches
High to the cotton mouth
Paranoid make the wrong move bitch and your ass is out
Like M.O.P. nigga i'll mash you out
If I can't get your head swing by your house (motherfucker)

Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge (U-Charge)
That truth come out when u drunk
Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge (U-Charge)
That truth come out when u drunk
Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing
On our mind thats leave with something
Get rid of that ring get rid of those cuffs
We about to... gurl
We about to... gurl
We about to... gurl (gurl)
We about to... gurl
We about to... gurl (gurl)

Yo party over here aint shit over there
The Mobb Deep boys got it locked right here
Wherever we at we keep the cliqs right there
So where ever theres beef is gettin fixed right there
And they can't stop us they too scared
They know a calibur thug shoot at heads nigga
Q.B. drop you off at that bridge (bye bye)
Show you how we do it in Queens
Murder aint shit nigga
This is P talking show you where I live
You come right through my crib (cmon) and get a few seers
There'll be man slaughter right infront of my kids
A little blood get on my daughter, thats nothing she'll live (just whipe that off)
Got cops shoot to death of us
We don't like D's
You never catch us runnin with the police (nope)
Ya'll niggas get ya'll vests up
And ya'll better invest in some real heavy bulletproof paneling

Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge (U-Charge)
That turth come out when u drunk
Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge (U-Charge)
That truth come out when u drunk
Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing
On our mind thats leave with something
Get rid of that ring get rid of those cuffs
We about to... gurl
We about to... gurl (gurl)
We about to... gurl
We about to... gurl (gurl)
