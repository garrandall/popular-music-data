Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name 
But I knew just who they meant.

I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself 
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling about you 
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa oh oh oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, now
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself 
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio 


If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud
They said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 


Sendin' in a letter to tell them that I love you, too
If you hear it, maybe you will know
When you hear them read the line about love's return on the radio
You'll think about the two of us and you'll come home
Whoa, oh, oh, 
If you knew just how I'd felt why'd you make me wait?
Life goes on and on while you play with my heart
Don't hold on any longer 'cause now I know how you really feel
'Cause I heard it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, 
If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sittin here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud
They said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
