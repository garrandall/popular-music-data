Sit down awhile
My mother said one day
And this is what she had to say

What are you gonna do, child
With those tears in your eyes
(Run) no use trying to tell yourself
(Hide) that you don't love the girl

Take it for what it's worth
(You can't hide)
Go to the end of the Earth
(You can't hide)
You can run, run, run but
Oh, you can't hide from love

What are you gonna say, child
When your heartaches won't go
(Run) you can't tell love to go
(Hide) and come back another day

Try to leave it behind
(You can't hide)
Well, she's still on your mind
(You can't hide)
Run, run, run but you
Can't hide from love

Love is too wide
You can't get around it
It's too high
You can't get over it
Oh, no, you can't get over it

So what are you
Gonna do now, child
You still love her so
(Run) what were you
Thinking of, little boy (hide)
When you let the little girl go

You're gonna find out one day
(You can't hide)
There is no hiding place
(You can't hide)
Run, run, run but you
Can't hide from love

Oh, run (run, run, run)
But you can't hide
(Run, run, run)
Love will be by your side
(Run, run, run)
'Cause wherever you go
(Run, run, run)
She will be there I know
