I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm so hot for her, I'm on fire for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold



Yeah, I tried re-wiring her
Tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled

She's so cold she's so cold
She's so cold cold cold
Like a tombstone
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold cold, cold like an ice cream cone
She's so cold she's so cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze



Yeah, I'm so hot for hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and even so
Put your hand on the heat, put your hand on the heat
Aw Come on baby, let's go
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, she's so c-c-c-old
But she's beautiful, though
Yeah, she's so cold



She's so cold, she's so cold
She was born in an arctic zone
She's so cold she's so cold, cold, cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze
She's so cold, she's so goddamn cold she's so
Cold cold cold she's so cold



Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know, when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold

You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
I'm so hot for you, I'm so hot for you
I'm so hot for you and you're so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
