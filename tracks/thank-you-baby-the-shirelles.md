Thank you baby, thank you baby)
Thank you baby (thank you baby) after all the years I've been true
Waiting, crying, and standin' by you
Suddenly found myself in the cold
I feel a young heart growin' old

(Thank you baby, thank you baby)
This my thanks (thank you baby) for my love, for my time and devotion
Not a praise, not a hope for promotion
This is my thanks for years of devotion
And now I'm left with no emotion

(Thank you baby, thank you baby)
Thank you baby, if you had seen the rain in my heart
We might have had a much better start
But you were blind, had other things on your mind
No more tears, drownin' in tears

(Thank you baby, thank you baby)
Thank you baby (thank you baby) I must go on out, start anew
The next time, baby, it could happen to you
Lost love is like fallen dew
Gone and forgotten, all thanks to you

(Thank you baby, thank you baby)
Oh thank you baby (thank you baby)
Thank you baby, but everything's gonna be all right
(Thank you baby)
