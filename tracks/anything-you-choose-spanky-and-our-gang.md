Hey girl
I'll do anything you say
'Cause you got a smile like a pocketful of diamonds
You got lips
I wish that they would ask me to stay here
Huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh

Hey girl
I'll do anything you choose
'Cause I read your eyes like a story in the newspaper
Say the word
I think you'll find me willing to stay here

Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh

It's the same old story
Gotta catch 'em on the fly
And leave 'em when you want to

My old alibi
Is thinking love is getting high
With anyone you want to

Hey, ain't it funny when the evening goes by
And you don't know if you're going to...

Hey girl hey
Why don't you take a chance?
You sure sound silly when you talk about romance
But, late at night, I think that it might really be the answer!

Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh

It's the same old story
Gotta catch 'em on the fly
And leave 'em when you want to

My old alibi
Is thinking love is getting high
With anyone you want to

Hey, ain't it funny when the evening goes by
And you don't know if you're going to...

Hey girl, take yours any way you want
But I'll take two lumps
A doughnut and a cookie
Oh, and would you ask me to stay here?

Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, ooh mama, uh-huh-huh
