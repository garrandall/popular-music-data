I'm so addicted 
To the loving that you're feeding to me 
Can't do without it. 
This feeling's got me weak in the knees 
Body's in withdrawal 
Every time you take it away 
Can't you hear me calling 
Begging you to come out and play? 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy 
Sweet sweet loving 
Got me going to the extreme 
Won't go without it 
This vibe has gotta hold on me 
Satisfying baby 
Let me show what i'm made of 
No doubt about it 
Got me feeling crazy can't get enough. 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy 
Now give it to me 
You know who you are 
Your love's as sweet as candy 
I'll be forever yours 
Love always, Mandy 
Boy I'm cravin' 
Missin' you like candy 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
oooh baby 
I'm craving for you 
I'm missing you like candy
