Hey now, hey now
Whatâs a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on...

Hey now, hey now
Whatâs a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mommy dear, weâre not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Woah girls, they wanna have fun

Hey now, hey now
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells whatcha gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear, you know your still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Woah girls, they wanna have

Thats all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
You know girls they wanna have fun
Come on

Hey now, hey now
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun

Hey now, hey now
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
(when the working day is done)
Whats a matta with ya
(you know girls they wanna have fun)
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
(whatâs a matta with ya)
And the boys they wanna have fun
(girls just wanna have)
And the girls they wanna have
(fun now)

Hey now, hey now
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Come on
(fun now)

And the boys they wanna have fun
And the girls they wanna have fun
(wanna have fun now)
And the boys they wanna have fun
(come on)
And the girls they wanna have
(come on)

Hey now, hey now
(oooooooo)
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on

Hey now, hey now
(oh mommy dear weâre not the fortunate ones)
Whats a matta with ya
Girls just wanna have fun now
Come on
