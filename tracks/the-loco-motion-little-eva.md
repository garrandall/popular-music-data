The loco-motion, the loco-motion
The loco-motion, the loco-motion
The loco-motion, the loco-motion
The loco-motion, the loco-motion

Everybody's doing a brand new dance now
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me

You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby, jump up, jump back
Oh well I think you got the knack

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain now
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
Chug-a-chug-a motion like a railway train now
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me

Move around the floor in a loco-motion
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you got the notion
(C'mon baby, do the loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on
