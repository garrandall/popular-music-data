Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah

You had the sweetest boy in the world
Without a doubt you were the envy of every girl
You're the kind that's never satisfied
You want every boy to pass you by
But the tables turned (the tables turned)
'Cause his words tell you're done
Now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
You thought it was fun to make the boys run

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

'Cause now he's hangin' around my door
More happier than before
Now you're in misery 'cause you lost him to me
Now the hurt's on you, now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
You made bets, any boy you could get

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah

Yes, your loss is my gain
'Cause straight into my arms he came
You want every boy to pass you by
Now the hurt's on you, now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
Now tears of regret just covered your face

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had
