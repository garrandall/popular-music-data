Saturday night, Saturday night We all get together on Saturday night
Put on your shoes, go downtown Do nothing but walk around On a Sunday or a Monday you can't do it right Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night Early in the evening all week long Sit on the stoop and sing your little song Cry on your pillow when things go wrong And wait for a Saturday night Saturday night, Saturday night
We all get together on Saturday night Look at the girls and what do we do
Turn around and see if they're lookin' to
On a Sunday or a Monday you can't do it right Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night Old timers down at Leadbetter's store
Tell ya young folks ain't like they were before
They're going to the dogs
You can see it more and more
Especially on a Saturday night Saturday evening when the works all done
Come on along and we'll have a little fun
We're sort of quiet and got a home spun
That we're wild on a Saturday Night Easy Now
Saturday night, Saturday night
We all get together on Saturday night Whooooooooo...
Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night Everybody now
Saturday night, Saturday night
We all get together on Saturday night We do things you've never seen
Ain't coming home 'til twelve-eighteen
On a Sunday or a Monday you can't do it right Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night
Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night
Green, green on a Saturday night
Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night
Ain't ya glad we got Saturday night
