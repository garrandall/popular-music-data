I guess it's been a while 
And a long time too
Everything's still the same and 
So are you 

It's only in this light
That I could see what you'd be like 
If it took a million years, well
This is what I am

You're awake and I'm asleep and 
We are so complete that way 
You're asleep and I'm awake and 
Everything is so great 
Everything is so great
Oh yeah
Heavy

I wash my hands of you
I wash my dirty feet, too 
And when I wash my hair the
Dust clouds disappear

You're leaning out the window
You're beating down a path real slow 
With your heavy plastic bags and 
Heavy head

You're awake and I'm asleep and 
We are so complete that way 
You're asleep and I'm awake and 
Everything is so great 
Everything is so great

I wish we had a laugh 
But you're just not funny 
Baby, I'm leaving out the 
Irony

You're awake and I'm asleep and 
We are so complete that way 
You're asleep and I'm awake and 
Everything is so great, oh yeah

You're awake and I'm asleep and 
We are so complete that way 
You're asleep and I'm awake and 
Everything is so great, oh yeah

You're awake and I'm asleep and 
We are so complete that way 
You're asleep and I'm awake and 
Everything is so great 
Everything is so great 
Yeah
