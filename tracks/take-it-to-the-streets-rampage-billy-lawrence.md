Rock on, rock on, rock on...


I got chicks in my livin room shakin they asses
Flipmode get ya high smokin weed and hash
Yo it's all about fun sex and drugs
Makin more money than all your rap thugs
I'm seein broads and panties passed around
Rampage is the nigga from underground
Sweet potato, caped crusader, I want a shorty like Jada
Tits are off like a mile later
So we can get buckwild, that's my style
I'm in a mansion in Strong Isle
Drinkin Don P and Cristal, yo that's the spoke file
I'm livin like Adino Brown, bow down
I'm the talk of the town, this is the low down
My show down, you can bet all your chips
I'ma take you around the world run up in ya girl
Ramp's in, call me Earl, uh


Niggas everywhere, bitches everywhere rockin to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do


Upside down I'ma turn it out bust it out
I'm the one you talkin about
Hittin Hennessee with my peeps from Tennessee
Givin you a head rush straight to your dome
I'm in the zone, plus I'm sitin on chrome
You jealous, what? Take your black ass home
Yo spots been blown from the brown skin pretty tone
I got it sown plus I'm bad to the bone
Its hot to def, make you breathe yo last breath
We could take it to the streets, we could call the ref
Yo I'm makin mad moves that's way to the top
Flipmode is the Squad and the Ramp won't stop


Niggas everywhere, bitches everywhere rockin to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do


I'm doin what I gotta do
I hear Charlie
Rampage is the boss of New York
Yo I fill more fantasies than Mr. Rork
Don't eat pork
Rap is the game I start
Keep it movin, throw yo hands in the air
Shake yo ass like you just don't care
Shake yo ass like you just don't care
Shake yo ass like you just don't care


Take a look around, its plain to see
That every niggas bopin to Ramp's new music in the street
I hear music in the street, and I hear a funky beat
And I get down, oh I get down
Niggas everywhere, bitches everywhere rockin to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do
Rock on rock on rock on...
