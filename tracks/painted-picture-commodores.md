You're my painted picture
You fill my life with color
You're my painted picture
You're the one that I adore

Loving you comes easy
I'll never try to change you
You're my inspiration
You're the one I'm living for

You know, girl
Looking at you makes my life so complete
And you have a way of looking at me right back
That makes me feel 

Look into my eyes, my love
And tell a story
They are just a window to my soul
I can see the beauty that is rare and precious
You're worth more to me than any man's gold

Girl, you have a way of blinding me
Every time I look into your eyes
You know how to start the fire
You know how to make the temperature rise
Don't be suspicious of what I am saying
All my feelings run so deep for you

You're the painted picture of my life
I'm hoping that I'm in your painted picture too
You're my life
You're my love
You're mine
You're the one that I adore

You're my life
You're my love
You're mine
You're the one I'm living for

You're my life
You're my love
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture

You're so satisfying
When nothing else makes sense
And when I'm tired of trying
You bring me tenderness

You're my painted picture
You fill my life with color
You're my painted picture
You're the one that I adore

Loving you comes easy
I'll never try to change you
You're my inspiration
You're the one I'm living for

You're my life
You're my love
You're mine
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture

You're my life
You're my love
What dreams are made of
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture

Let me tell you that
You're my life
You're my love
You're mine
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture

Apple of my eye
Been on my mind
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture

You're my life
You're my love
You're what dreams are made of
Painted picture
Painted picture
My illuminated painted picture
