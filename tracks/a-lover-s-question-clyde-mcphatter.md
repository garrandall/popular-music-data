Does she love me, with all her heart
Should I worry, when we're apart
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know

Does she need me, as she pretends
Is this a game, well then will I win
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know

I'd like to know when she's not with me
If she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
Does she feel just what I feel
And how am I to know it's really real

Oh, tell me where, the answer lies
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes
It's a lover's question I'd like to know

I'd like to know when she's not with me
If she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
Does she feel just what I feel
And how am I to know it's really real

Oh, tell me where, the answer lies
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes
It's a lover's question I'd like to know
