It's so hard lovin' you
But I just can't let you go

Little darlin', I love you
Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', got to have you

And if it means givin' up my pride
Oh, I'm gonna give it up, give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm willin' to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I love you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', got to have you

Only my pillow knows
How many tears I've cried
Only my heart knows
The awful hurt I feel inside
My life is so lonely
Waitin' for you to love me only
I'm willin', darlin'

I'm willin' to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', I love you
Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', got to have you

Yeah, there was a time
Way back in your life
When I was the only one, only one
You'd better let this fool back in
Or you will be the lonely one
Darlin', I love you
Little darlin' I need you
