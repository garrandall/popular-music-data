Jason Derulo


Check that out, what they playing? That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks? I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl in my lap passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is going home


From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight, or is it nighttime?
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up


Day-o, me say day-o
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down, to the floor, oh, oh, oh
Day-o, me say day-o
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home


We drink the whole bottle, but it ain't over, over
Everybody jumping on the sofa, sofa
Standing on the chairs, standing on the bar
No matter day or night, I'm shining, bitch, I'm a star


From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow (yeah, 'til tomorrow)
Is it daylight, or is it nighttime?
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up


Day-o, me say day-o
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down, to the floor, oh, oh, oh
I said day-o, me say day-o (woo)
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home (let's go)


I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriends, "Let's meet in my cabana"
Ask me where the party at, baby, I'm the answer
Have another drink with me, shorty, where your manners?
Take another shot, another shot, shot, shot, shot (haha, oh, yeah)
I can make it hot, make it hot, we gon' rock until the...


Day-o, me say day-o (day-o, me say)
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home (we don't wanna go home, baby, no)
Yeah, so we losing control (control)
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down, to the floor, oh, oh, oh (to the floor, ba-ba-baby)
Day-o, me say day-o (me say da, me say da-da-day-o)
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
