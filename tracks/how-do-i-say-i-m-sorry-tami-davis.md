How do I say that I'm sorry
Without breaking down, breaking down
Can we ever go back to the way we both started out
Help me out

I believe I've been misunderstood
My intentions have been nothing but good
Needed time, so I turned away
Thought I needed space

I admit I made a big mistake
So please don't say a second chance is too late (babe)
You've been better to me
Than I've been to myself

Don't wanna live my life without you
And loving someone else, you know it won't do
It'd be a crying shame to lose
Everything that we shared

I don't know how else to break it down
My world stops turning when you're not around
You don't know what it would do me
If you said "I love you" again

I know that i have called you, babe
Tell me can't we start it all over again
So I can be all the things to you
That you are to me

If you give me just one more chance (babe)
I promise you won't regret it
Nothing in this world means more to me than you

Didn't mean to make you cry
And I know, I know the pain I caused inside
I can make it good again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm sorry
