Ever drunk as ever baby
Wayne Hennessey
Scoob! Salut!
Twiztid! Salut!

I'm fillin' up my Dixie cup
Throwin' up and I'm liquored up
Stumbling and I'm spilling stuff
Like hell yeah

Double fistin' my Dixie cup
Twisted and I'm liquored up
Toasted and I lift it up
Like hell yeah

Put your cups up and I'm drinkin', tryna get fucked up
They buyin' it for me, I'm locked up and I'm looking for Scoob
They showin' cleavage so free drinks can get the recievage
But I ain't buying cause you ain't leavin' with me
What I'm gonna do?
I'm off in the dark and now I'm clear, I don't drink any beer
I try to cut 'em off they keep handin' 'em here
Now I'm too drunk to steer
Get drunk like we're supposed to
Pop off the top of the oranges drink some mimosas
But when I get closer she tell me she goes to shows, now listen closely
Salut! Drink until my face is black and b-lue
Tippin' the waitress so she gon keep on goin' by you
I'm off that KC tea, Caribou is super doo
I tryna get drunk as a skunk so give liquor me too, Kali

I'm fillin' up my Dixie cup
Throwin' up and I'm liquored up
Stumbling and I'm spilling stuff
Like hell yeah

Double fistin' my Dixie cup
Twisted and I'm liquored up
Toasted and I lift it up
Like hell yeah

Drunk as fuck right now, I ain't lyin' nigga
Been sippin' all night, I'm prime nigga
Drunk and stupid, 'bout to lose it, did I say I'm stupid?
Old job, me and Brook how we keep it movin'
Look at daddy, brought my body, colors rossipatti
Mr. Potti when I'm pissin', help me somebody
Almighty if you listenin', help me please God
I'm outside, nothin' drive, can you steer the car?
Lift the door head spinnin', I ain't getting 4
Pedal to the metal, rebel so I'm pushin' hard
Pistol cop, tryna make it back to the block
Runnin' red, tiers spin, must evade the cops

I'm fillin' up my Dixie cup
Throwin' up and I'm liquored up
Stumbling and I'm spilling stuff
Like hell yeah

Double fistin' my Dixie cup
Twisted and I'm liquored up
Toasted and I lift it up
Like hell yeah

I guess tonight's the night that we blame it all on the Dixie cup
It's barely 6 o'clock and already I'm feelin' super drunk
And like my spirits her shirt keeps liftin'
And if I had to sum it up with one word
Bottles are poppin' and everybody's wonderin' if we're gonna stop
All I keep thinkin' is let me keep drinkin' until I go puke in the parkin' lot
Until they call the cops, now I gotta find another way to get my shots
I don't remember which way I came so I'm a stay away from my trucks

Pour me up, I don't want you watchin on my Dixie cup
Keep it 100 proof 'til I'm drunk n' stuff
Cause I'm over at the bar tryna love a slut
Cause I like to cut and I put 'em in the butt till I bust a nut
Cause I'm crazy like that so don't you know
So I puke a little n blink my eye
Tryna see if I can that six piece home
Ciroc and Grey Goose, three olives I'm vodka
Friendly rum chowder bought a bottle bottom's up for my liquor medley mix-ologist
My apologies for drinkin' you dry
So put the bill on my tab, you throw the deuces it's time to ride

I'm fillin' up my Dixie cup
Throwin' up and I'm liquored up
Stumbling and I'm spilling stuff
Like hell yeah

Double fistin' my Dixie cup
Twisted and I'm liquored up
Toasted and I lift it up
Like hell yeah
