There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Billy Ocean
Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory?
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you
Especially when the words of love song
Touch the very heart of me
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, I love you
I often wonder how it could be
You loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
The rhapsody plays a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one I will wait for
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, ohoohhohh
You're my desire, you take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for, the one that I will wait for
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
Ah... Ah...
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, I love you
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Oh..
Saying I love you
(Spoken)
I love you
