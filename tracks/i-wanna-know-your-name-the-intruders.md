I wanna know your name, mmm
Ooh, you look so good
I wanna know your name
What's your name, baby
I'd love ya, if I could

'Cause, you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Hey, where do you live
Where do you live, baby
I'd like to take you home
What do I have to give
What do I have to give
To call you on the phone

'Cause, you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell me your name, please tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Ain't never seen nothin' as sweet as you
(I wanna know your name)
Sitting there in that grey dress, pretty little thing
(I wanna know your name)

'Cause, I never believed
In love at first sight
But now I know
That it's alright

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Please, tell me your name, what's your name
(I wanna know your name)
You look so good, you look so good
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, ain't never seen nothing like this in my life
(I wanna know your name)
You just look like something I could settle down with

Let me introduce myself
My name is Little Sonny
I drive a little red Volkswagen
I like to go horse-back riding
I like all kind of sweets
Cupcakes, currants, and things like that
This is why I can't help from noticing you
Just a jazzy, jazzy ol' babe
Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance
Lord, have mercy
Am I holding you too tight?
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 'scuse me
Ain't gonna get too close
When are you going to tell me your name?
Please tell me your name?
I'm just going to have to grab you and hold you a little closer
'Cause, I just got to
Lord, have mercy

(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name, mm-hmm
(I wanna know your name)
Just hold me, just squeeze me
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing, you
(I wanna know your name)
I could love ya, I could love ya
I could love ya all night long, all night long, all night long
Mm-hmm

Listen, what about if you give me your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps, we'll go in town
Have a little bite to eat
And then maybe go and take in a little movie
And afterwards
I'll just drop you at the huh.. at the doorstep
And give you a little kiss
Oh, I, just, so many things that we could do
If you just tell me your name
I'm not even married
Are you married

Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door
(I wanna know your name)
Don't leave me, don't leave me, unless you tell
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell, just tell me, girl, just wait a minute
(I wanna know your name)
Baby
