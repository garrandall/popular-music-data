Can I get through to you now, can I Marianne?
What are you tryin' to do now come on Marianne
Ain't no use in conversation
Poor little girl you're outta this world Marianne

Everyone seems to think you're too much Marianne
Everyone seems to think they know you Marianne
Why you don't even know yourself?
Poor little girl you're out of this world Marianne
Wake up Marianne

Ooh I can tell, you're a sweet little heart breaker Marianne
Don't mind me but I think, I'll see you later Marianne
Don't you go flip out, trip out, skip out
Poor little girl you're outta this world Marianne

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Or are you afraid of the shakeup?
There's a better thing you can take up
Wake up Marianne, wake up Marianne
Wake up Marianne, ooh Marianne
Ooh
