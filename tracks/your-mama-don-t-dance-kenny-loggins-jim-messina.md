Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?

The old folks say that ya gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date and you bring it home late, it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin' you know you're gonna lose and never win
I'll say it again

And it all because
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?

You pull into a drive-in and find a place to park
You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to groove and you're thinkin' it's a breeze
There's a light in your eye and then a guy says
"Out of the car, long hair
Louise, you're comin' with me and no more movies"

And it all because
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
Where do you go to rock and roll?
