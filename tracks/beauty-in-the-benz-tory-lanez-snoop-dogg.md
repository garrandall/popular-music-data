Keep it real this how I'm coming in it from the jump
You're so beautiful, I kiss and hit it from the front
Take you everywhere with me 'cause I love to stunt
Money everywhere with me 'cause you love to stunt
Hit the strip club with me make 10 G's
We'll be running up the bag till it empty
Got a temper 'cause she bad, don't tempt me
Shawty I'm a different man off the Hennessy
Tryna hit it so good, you remember me
Pussy good like -
Fucking your body I let it go down
I make it ring like the Neptunes sound
You hold it down like a stunna, you done cleaned that
You hold it down every summer in Celine bag
When you're giving me love, you never keep that
You never give me enough, no and I need that
We gon' fuck up the sheets, send 'em to the cleaners
We might smoke weed on the way and catch a misdemeanor
All my young niggas they wanna get with you and beat it
My ex hate when I'm with you, it's getting her heated

Cause you so beautiful, oh oh oh oh
Said you're beautiful, oh oh oh


What can I say to you that you ain't never heard
I'm breakin' it down, shawty I'm talking bout erry word
Observe how I splizzerve slick like a iceberg
Cold with the wizzords, I'm lit like my izzerd
Of course it all matters if you with it or not
'Cause If you don't you won't, but if you get it you got
Ain't nothing wrong with this, now peep it out
And if it's too hard, then go ahead and bleep it out
See I'ma tell you what I see cause what I see is all I know
I'll wrap you up with a bow, lay you out on the floor
And let Tory tell the story 'cause you know how it go
Then hit the switch in my blue '64, mm-mm


Beautiful, oh oh oh oh
Said you're beautiful, oh oh

You know how to let me know if I done done enough
Touchdown in me, put the numbers up
Wanna leave, 'cause he don't make you come enough
Well guess what? I'm the next runner up
Big bank baby and I'll spend it all on you
Fuck it up in here, that's what we ought to do
A lot of options, I could call 'em through
I switch an option, like an audible
Bentley Bentayga, girl you gets paper
They be pocket-watching the money you get paid
I wanna fly you to the St. and Jamaica
You damaging makeup, still manage to make it
Humble as ever but stunt with the cheddar
You grind with me we gon' come up together
Rainy days, we gon' stand it together
Cause the Rolls Royce I drive, it come with umbrellas
I don't talk no shit cause I just back the shit up
I'ma flip lil shawty like a spatula
I'ma sink my teeth in it deep, Dracula
Pretty Rick when I hit it, hella spectacular

Beautiful, oh oh oh oh
Said you're beautiful, oh oh oh, yeah
