I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one’s been before
But it feels like home


They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don’t care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design


'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make


There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day


They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design


'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it’s gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we’re gonna make


However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see


Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make


For the world we're gonna make
