Hello world, hope you’re listening
Forgive me if I’m young
Or speaking out of turn
But there’s someone i’ve been missing
And I think that they could be
The better half of me
They’re in the wrong place trying to make it right
But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you...


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home


I get lost in the beauty of everything I see
The world ain’t as half as bad
As they paint it to be
When all the sons, all the daughters stop to take it in
Then hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
It might start now
Maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
But until then...


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home


Everything I can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why I need you here
Everything I can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why I need you here
So hear this now


Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home
I'm home
