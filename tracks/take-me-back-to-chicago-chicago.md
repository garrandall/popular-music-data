Take me back to Chicago
Lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best
Take me back to Chicago
Where music was all I had
I tried to be good as I could
And sometimes that made me sad


Take me back to Chicago, to Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago


I still dream of the Lake of peacefulness
The warm summer breeze
Because my life was so much simpler then
Street corners and Tastee Freeze
Take me back to Chicago
Because hustling's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child


Living back in Chicago, in Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago


Take me back to Chicago
Lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best
Take me back to Chicago
Because hustling's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child


Living back in Chicago, in Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago, to Chicago


Take me back, take me
