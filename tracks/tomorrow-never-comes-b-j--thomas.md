Oh, you tell me that you love me
Yes, you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow is never there

Many weeks now have I waited
Many, many long nights have I cried
Just to see that, that happy moment
When I'll have you right by my side

But tomorrow ain't never gonna come
Oh no, no, tomorrow, ain't never ever gonna come
Oh, you tell me you love me and you say that you want me
But tomorrow never comes
