Another night in revelry
Recalling all we used to be
So what became of you and me?
(Ah)

No one could make me move that way
Your body had so much to say
Together we made music
(Ah)

You were my dancer
You were my dancer
My fancy dancer
You swept me off my feet
My sweet dancer
Where are you dancer
My fancy dancer
I'll never love another
Dancer

Guess I was young and sort of free
So I feel for your routine
You did a dance I've never seen
(Ah)

Now I'm a dancer in the dark
Without a partner where's the spark?
It hurts to hear the music start
Where did you go I'll never know

You were my dancer
You were my dancer
My fancy dancer
You swept me off my feet
My sweet dancer
Where are you dancer
My fancy dancer
I'll never love another

You're very special and you're need
It's impossible to speak of
All the ways you make me weak love
My love
My love
My love

The dance I'll never do again
Steps I won't go through again
Until I dance with you again

(Where did you go?)

Where did you go?

Dancer
Oh my dancer
Dancer
My dancer, dance again with me (you swept me off my feet)
Wish that I could dance with you dance my whole life through
Fancy dancer
