Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him just because you can. 

Your beauty is beyond compare with flaming locks of auburn hair 
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green 
Your smile is like a breath of spring, your voice is soft like summer rain 
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene. 

He talks about you in his sleep and there's nothing I can do to keep 
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene 
But I can easily understand how you could easily take my man 
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene. 

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him just because you can. 

You could have your choice of men but I could never love again 
He's the only one for me, Jolene 
I had to have this talk with you, my happiness depends on you 
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene. 

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man 
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Please don't take him even though you can. 

Jolene, Jolene, (Jolene...)
