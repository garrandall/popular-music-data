Am I losing you?
Are my fears coming true?
How I wish I knew
Am I losing you?
Is your love really true?
Is there somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?


Am I too blind to see (too blind to see)
What's been happening to me? (Happening to me)
Every road has a bend (Road has a bend)
Will I be sweetheart or friend? (Sweetheart or friend)


Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?


Am I too blind to see (too blind to see)
What's been happening to me? (Happening to me)
Every road has a bend (Road has a bend)
Will I be sweetheart or friend? (Sweetheart or friend)


Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?
