(Cook that shit up Quay!)
(Lil Baby)

I been runnin' round in rental cars tryna lay low
I'm a real 'Soulja Boy,' I really play with Dracos
Fuck the whole game, I'm outta here, then put them on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the K-roll
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her make-over
I was being calm, like it's there for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Roadster
300 on a G-Wagon, I'm a big dog, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't adding up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home-run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs, clout-chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from we don't do fraud, you a king-pin or a taker

I just bought a bust down, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gonna play with him, he did it off of love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

I just bought a bust down, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gonna play with him, he did it off of love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

Street love, nigga, street niggas call me Pluto
Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo
Sip the sizzurp, took me to number one, no promo
I'm in spaceships, I'm the boss on the low-low
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo
I got million dollar stars on my payroll
I feel like it's different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV cutted up, got little baguettes in it, cut it up
One "Crrrt!" call, that's all "Brrt!"p-pullin' up
It's bad, make a bad bad bitch call up and quit her job
Where I'm from, you either gotta murder, if you make it out you a God

I just bought a bust down, can't wait to hold it up
All these Perks won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Gang ain't gonna play with him,he did it all for love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

I just bought a bust down, can't wait to hold it up
All these Perks won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Gang ain't gonna play with him, he did it all for love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
