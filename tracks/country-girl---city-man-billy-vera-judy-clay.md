I was born in New York City
I was born in Georgia
Girl, you're looking kinda pretty
Don't you think we oughta

Get to know each other better
Take the time to find out
While we can


Gotta be some soul between
A country girl and a city man
We could find, we could find
It's groovy just to cross the line

City boy had your eggs and bacon
You were raised on cornbread
The rooster crowed while I was waking
'Bout the time I was going to bed

Bet we got a lot in common
Take the time to find out
While we can



We could find, we could find
It's groovy just to cross the line

He was born in New York City
She was born in Georgia
Girl, you're looking fine
Don't you think we oughta

Get to know each other better
Take the time to find out
While we can



That man's from New York City
She's a girl from Georgia town
We could find, we could find
It's groovy just to cross the line

That man's from New York City
She's a girl from Georgia town
We could find, we could find
It's groovy just to cross the line
