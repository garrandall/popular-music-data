Uno, dos, tres... catorce

Turn it up loud, Captain!

Lights go down itâs dark
The jungle is your head - canât rule your heart
A feeling is so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul it canât be bought
Your mind can wonder

Hello, hello... (Hola)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (dÃ³nde estÃ¡s?)
Itâs everything I wish I didnât know
Except you give me something...
I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they canât dance - at least they know

I canât stand the beats
Iâm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus 'round her neck
Swinging to the music  Whoooaaa
Swinging to the music  Whoooaaa
Whoooaaa
Whoooaaa
Whoooaaa

Hello, hello... (Hola)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (dÃ³nde estÃ¡s?)
Itâs everything I wish I didnât know
But you give me something...
I can feel, feel

Check mated...
Hours of fun...
Jumping in... yeah



All of this... all of this can be yours
All of this... all of this can be yours
All of this... all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt

Hello, hello... (Hola)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (dÃ³nde estÃ¡s?)
Lights go down and all I know
That you give me something...
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how to kneel, kneel

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, YEEEAAAAH!
