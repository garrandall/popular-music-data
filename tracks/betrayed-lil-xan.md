You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat


Ooh, I pop a Perc' when I'm upset (what?)
She sucked my dick right on Sunset (Sunset)
I made a few millis, ain't done yet (milli')
Addicted to the money, spent a hundred in the club
I told them Xans that, "I hate you"
I told that bitch "I can't date you" (bitch)
She pop a pill and go cuckoo
She'll ride on a dick like a new coupe
Hit a ho with a stick like a bamboo (bamboo)
I'm the shit, got it lit like a candle (what?)
Nobody can't tell me what I can't do (can't do)
I can make the plug walk like some new shoes (plug, what?)
New Chanel coat, lil' bitch get her heart broke (broke)
Half a milli' in my cargos (cargos)
I'ma fuck her then I send her 'bout her way ('bout her way)
Can't fall in love, I ain't tryna get betrayed (Rich)


Xans don't make you (you)
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you (yeah)
And Xans gon' betray you (what? Yeah)
Xans don't make you (you)
Xans gon' take you (brrr)
Xans gon' fake you (yeah)
Xans gon' betray you (ayy, yeah, ayy)

And she still tastes like Skittles (ayy)
And her friend still tastes like Skittles (what)
Put me right up in the middle (ayy)
You know I had to go and solve the riddle (ayy)
Used to pop Xans like brittle (ayy)
She want to go to Heaven but she evil (ayy)
Facin' my demons is never that easy (ayy, what?)
I get what I want, now I got what I needed (yeah, ayy, ayy, what?)
We look at the sky and she tell me she bleedin' (ayy, yeah)
Heartbreak ain't gon' change you
But baby I won't change you
And if I die don't miss me (ayy)
I wish that bitch just kiss me (ayy)
And if I die don't miss me (ayy)
I wish that bitch just kiss me (ayy)

Xans don't make you (you)
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you (yeah)
And Xans gon' betray you (what? Yeah)
Xans don't make you (you)
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you (yeah)
Xans gon' betray you (what? Yeah)


I was sellin'... pills
Shawty got... skills
Gang shit... trill
Cold heart... chills
Ain't another bitch like shawty (yeah)
She don't want Rollies, she want a Glock 40
Tats on her body, bandanas on her head
Big brother Crip, but her favorite color red
Shit I was sellin' coulda sent me to the feds
Shit I was doin' coulda left a nigga dead
Only got one motto: get to the bread
Doin' fuck shit, put a bullet in your head (bow)
Everything about it, always had heart (heart)
That shit made me me, see?
M 'cause I'm gettin' to the money
Gotta keep it gangsta, yeah that's the G (ayy)


Xans don't make you (Xans)
Xans gon' take you (yeah, what?)
Xans gon' fake you (yeah)
And Xans gon' betray you (what? Yeah)
Xans don't make you (pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you (pew, pew)
Xans gon' betray you (brr)

Yeah, Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
What? Ayy
What? Ayy
Xans gon' take you
Yeah Xans gon'
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' take you
