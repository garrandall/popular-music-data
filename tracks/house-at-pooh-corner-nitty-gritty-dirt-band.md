Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon

But I wandered much further today than I should
And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood

So help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done

Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes

So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done

Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin
Back to the days of Pooh
