A human heart goes out tonight
Yes, a red hot love on a red stop light
I see a scene, so cold it echoes in blue
Oh, those twisting tongues, they are after you


Wop bop a lu bop, Son, you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy Miss Clawdy
Oh, what a story dreams to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all so insane


When the other man has none
You don't need a gun
Yes a Russian roulette, no fun
I don't need a gun
I just need someone
I don't need a gun


Blood red lights a domination street
Yeah, I just need your love, and I feel that heat
Yeah, you can drive me through
That red stop light
With a whiplash smile, Woahhh!


Wop bop a lu bop, yeah, you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy Miss Clawdy
Oh, what a story dreams to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all so insane


I say when the other man has none
You don't need a gun
A Russian roulette, no fun
I don't need a gun, yeah I just need someone
I won't need a gun
Oh yeah


You will always be crying, yeah
Oh, you will always be dying
Oh, you will always be dying


Elvis, a fight, the dying light
Johnnie Ray, he's always crying
Gene Vincent, he cried, "Who slapped John, John, John"
Yes and me, I'm movin', movin', movin', movin' on
Yeah, to be someone
I don't need a gun
I don't need a gun
I don't need a gun

Ow!
You will always be crying
...
