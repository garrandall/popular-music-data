I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin, in a spin

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

Lay your head down real close to me
Soothe my mind and set me free, set me free

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin, in a spin

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
Hot stuff
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Gotta have love tonight
I need hot stuff
Hot love
Looking for hot love

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot

How's about some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Gimme little hot stuff baby this evenin'
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight
Hot stuff
I need hot love
Lookin' hot stuff
Wanna have hot love

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers baby
I'm bound to find somebody home

Gonna have some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Lookin for my hot stuff baby this evenin'
Need some lovin' baby
Gonna need your love tonight

Hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin
I want some hot stuff baby tonight (yeah)
Hot stuff baby

I want your hot stuff baby this evenin
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight

Oot toot hey beep beep

Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about the bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night, walkin'
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right you can score
If you're pocket's nice
But you want a good time
You ask yourself, who they are?
Like everybody else, they come from near and far

Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about the bad girls, yeah

Friday night and the strip is hot
Sun's gone down and they're about to trot
Spirit's high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down
Now don't you ask yourself, who they are?
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star

Sad girls, sad girls
You such a dirty bad girl
Beep beep uh, uh
You bad girl, you sad girl
You such a dirty bad girl
Beep beep uh, uh

Now you and me, we are both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now you mama won't like it when she finds out
Her girl is out at night

Toot toot hey beep beep

Hey mister, have you got a dime?
Mister, do you want to spend some time, oh yeah
I got what you want
You got what I need
I'll be your baby
Come and spend it on me
Hey mister
I'll spend some time with you
With you, you're fine, with you
Bad girls
They're just bad girls
Talkin' about sad girls
Sad girls
Hey, hey mister
Got a dime

Toot toot hey beep
