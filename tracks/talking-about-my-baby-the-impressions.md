I wanna talk about my baby, yeah yeah
With her pretty smile, yeah yeah
She's 'bout to drive me crazy, yeah yeah
Makes my heart beat wild

So everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

I wanna talk about my baby, yeah yeah
She does the walk real nice, yeah yeah
There's no questions about maybe
For her I'd make any sacrifice

So everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And when she walks that walk
I can't help but feel that she's for real
And when she talks that talk
I can't quite explain just how I feel
Talking about my baby

I wanna talk about my baby, yeah yeah
To me she's everything, yeah yeah
She might fuss and call yer lazy
But to her I'm still the king

So everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
