Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Trying to get home

Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Trying to get home

It's been so long since I've seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've travelled so very far
I've got to get back home

It's been so long since I've kissed her
And held her tight in my arms
I've got so far to go now
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

It's been so long since I've seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've travelled so very far
I've got to get back home

It's been so long since I've kissed her
And held her tight in my arms
I've got so far to go now
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm (walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (thinking 'bout my baby)
Trying to get home (trying to get home)

I'm walking in rhythm (walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (thinking 'bout my baby)
Trying to get home (trying to get home)

I'm walking in rhythm (walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (thinking 'bout my baby)
Trying to get home (trying to get home)
