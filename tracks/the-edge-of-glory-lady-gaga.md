There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight


It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love


I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you


Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)


It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love


I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you




I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
