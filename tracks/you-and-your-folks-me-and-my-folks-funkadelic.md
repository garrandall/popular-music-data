(Let me hear you say)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Let me hear you say)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah-yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah

If you and your folks love me and my folks like
Me and my folks love you and your folks
If there ever was folks
That ever ever was poor

If you and your thing dig me and my thing
Like me and my thing dig you and your thing
And we all got a thing
Yeah, and it's a very good thing

Ha! But if in our fears, we don't learn to trust each other
And if in our tears, we don't learn to share with your brother
You know that hate is gonna keep on multiplying
And you know that man is gonna keep right on dying
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah


The rich got a big piece of this and that
The poor got a big piece of roaches and rats
Can you get to that
Tell me where it's at
Yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey!
You want peace
I want peace
They want peace
And the kids need peace
There won't be no peace

The rich got a big piece of this and that
The poor got a big piece of roaches and rats
Can you get to that
Tell me where it's at

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah

If you and your folks loved me and my folks
Like me and my folks love you and your folks
If there ever was folks
That ever ever was poor

If you and your thing dig me and my thing
Like me and my thing dig you and your thing
Then we all got a thing
And it's a very good thing

Yeah, yeah, yeah
