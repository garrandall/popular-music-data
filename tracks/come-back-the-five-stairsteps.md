Come back to me
Where have you gone now?
Off with somone new?
If you really love me
Let me be yoir friend
Just come back
Come.back

Oooh
To make you feel this way
Oooh
If i cant stop crying
I would have to stay
Just come back
Come back
To me
Come back
Come back to me
Im sa mad about you

Dont know what to do without you
Oiih
You always are on my mind
I dream of you all the time
So come back
Come back

Come back
Come back
