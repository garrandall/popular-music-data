A sleepy lagoon
A tropical moon and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon
And two hearts in tune
In some lullaby land
The fireflies gleam
Reflect in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high
Falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer

The leaves from the trees
All dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
I'm lost in the spell
That nightingales tell of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon
A sleepy lagoon, and you

Stand still
Oh heaven and earth and river
Stand still
Oh time in your endless flight
If love can but command
The moon will stand
The sun won't wake
The day won't break and it will always be tonight

The leaves from the trees
All dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
I'm lost in the spell
That nightingales tell of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon
A sleepy lagoon
And you
