Let me see that body language (baby baby)
I said talk to me
Let me see that body language (hey, hey)


Girl give it to me
Girl you know what it do, girl give it to me
I got somethin brand new, girl give it to me
I'll put it all on you, girl give it to me
Wooo! I got a gift for ya
I got this for ya, a little Thicke for ya
A big kiss for ya, I got a hit for ya
Big dick for ya, let me give it to ya
Baby baby, I got a call for ya
I got a whip for ya, black car for ya
Ball hard for ya, I know you wanna get fancy
I know you wanna start dancin


Hey... girl
You know you're lookin so damn fine
You're lookin like you fell from the sky
You know you make a grown man cry


I wanna give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
come true, ooh baby
I'll make you so so so amazing
I'll give it to you


Girl give it to me 

Ooh! What's that girl?
What's that baby? I like that girl
I like that baby, on your back girl
On your back, yeah shake it like that girl
Baby baby, I got an eye for ya
Got an eye for ya, I got a smile for ya
Cheese, let me put it on your face for ya
Please, I got a taste for ya
Tasty, I bought lace for ya
Freaky, I'll put it on ya
Yeah, so I can come and take it off ya
Yeah, and get off to ya






True, yo.. 2 Chainz!

Highly respected
Black Michael Jackson
When the DJ bring it back
I pump it back like a chiropractor
I'm at the main event
Baby you the main attraction
What I need a script and a camera for?
Let's put this thing in action
(Do it) Let's put this thing in action
(Do it) Let's put this thing in action!
(Do it) 2 Chainz!
All the things collapsin
Let's put this thing in action
(Do it) Let's put this thing in ACTION!
(Do it) 2-2 Chainz!
Gave your girl a chain reaction


Uh, you're like a needle in a haystack
Uh, I wanna sit you where my face at
Uh, lunch with a few Mai-Tais
Uh, purple kisses on my tie
Uh, life can leave a dick loved
Uh, now you gettin this dick, love
Uh, I'm lookin for you with a flashlight
I wanna feel what a real fat ass like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby this pedestrian
Runnin through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy like pop like "DO!" Go get me a burner
Got shot like "DO!" This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You're cotton candy, I need a fistful
I'm often antsy, hope that convince you






Uhh...
I'll give it back, like that
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
I'll give it back, just like that
