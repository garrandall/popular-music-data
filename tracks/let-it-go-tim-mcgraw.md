I've been caught sideways out here on the crossroads
Trying to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back
It's like carrying around the past in a hundred pound sack


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


Skeletons and ghosts are hiding in the shadows
Threatening me with all the things that they know
Choices and mistakes, they all know my name
But I'm through holding in and holding onto all that pain


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


I know I know I know I've been forgiven
I know I know I know I'm going to start living


Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away Yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah


Oh yeah
