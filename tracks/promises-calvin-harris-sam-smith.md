Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin'?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined?
'Cause I'm ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, h'm


I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)
I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)

Tonight
(You're everything tonight)


Is it loud enough?
'Cause my body is calling for you, calling for you
I need someone to do the things that I do, mm
I'm heating up, energy's taking control
I'm speeding up
My heartbeat's dancing alone


I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)
I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)

Tonight
(You're everything tonight)


'Cause I need your green light
Day and night, say that you're mine
'Cause I need your green light
Day and night, say that you're mine
Say that you're mine
Say that you're mine


I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)
I make no promises
I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight)
Magic is in the air
There ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight)


Tonight
