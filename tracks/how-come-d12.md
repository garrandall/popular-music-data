So I changed, huh? You got a phone
Pick it up, call me


How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you


We were so young so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it


How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you


It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you


How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you


It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face


How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you
