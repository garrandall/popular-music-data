It's been so long
Since I've seen her face
You say she's doing fine
I still recall
A sad cafe
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't want to say good-bye


Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love


The same hotel, the same old room
I'm on the road again
She needed so much more
Than I could give
We knew our love could not pretend
Broken hearts can always mend

Calling out her name I'm dreaming
Reflections of a face I'm seeing
It's her voice
That keeps on haunting me
