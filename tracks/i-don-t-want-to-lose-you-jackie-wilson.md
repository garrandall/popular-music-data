At last it finally happened
You came into my world
After trying for a long, long time
You decided to be my girl

And...

I don't wanna lose you now
I don’t wanna lose you right now
I don't wanna lose you now

There couldn't be a happier fella
Than I am right now
And whatever it takes to hold you, baby
I’ll do or get it somehow

'Cause...

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you right now
I don't wanna lose you now

So many times in the past
My romances they just didn't last
It was one heartbreak after each other
And one tear after another

I count myself lucky
For falling love with you
'Cause you don't know, baby
What the man’s been going through

That’s why...

I don't wanna lose you now
I don’t wanna lose you right now
I don't wanna lose you now

Gotta say it again

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you right now
I don’t wanna lose you now
