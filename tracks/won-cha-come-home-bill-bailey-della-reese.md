Hey, Bill Bailey
Don't look now but
Somebody's calling you

Who, why, your
Lady friend, that's who
If I were you, If I were you
I'd get my little old self home

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cooking, honey
I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong

Do you remember that rainy evening
I threw you out with nothing
But a fine tooth comb
Yeah, I know I'm to blame
Ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come home

Ah, walk on home, Bill

Ah, I like it like that
Hey, Bailey, let's go on
Home one more time, hear

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cooking, honey
I'll even pay the rent
I know, I know I done you wrong

Do you remember that rainy evening
That I drove you out with
Nothing but a fine tooth comb
And you were bald

I know I'm to blame
Well, ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come

Bailey, won't you please come
Come on, Bailey
Won't you please come, yo
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come

One more time,
Oh, Bailey won't you
Please come home
Get on home
