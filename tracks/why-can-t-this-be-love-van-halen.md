Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch

Hey I don't know
Ooh tell me where to begin
Cause I never ever
Felt so much


And I can't recall
Any love at all
Baby this blows 'em all away


It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love

Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love


I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in
Only time will tell
If we stand the test of time

All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned ifI'll get
Hung up on the line


No I can't recall
Anything at all
Baby this blows 'em all away


It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love

You want it straight from the heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love




It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love

Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love

Baby why
Can't this be love

Got to know why
Can't this be love

I wanna know why
Can't this be love
