Jumping with my boy, Sid
right here in the city.
Don't you know that is was grand?
Really grand, so grand.
And then you came along,
then you came along, boy.
And sang your groovy song,
sang a song and I asked:

Mr. Whatchacallem, whatcha doing tonight?
Hope you're in the mood
because I'm feeling just right.
How's about a corner
with a table for two?
Where the music's mellow
is a gay rendezvous.
There's no chance romancing
with a blue attitude.
You know you got to do some dancing
to get in the mood.

Mr. Watchacallem, I'm indebted to you.
You're here. It goes to show what good influence can do.
Never felt so happy or so fully alive.
He's a jam a jumpin', it's a powerful jive!
Swing-a-roo is giving me a new attitude.
My heart is full of rhythm
and I'm in the mood.

In the mood (oh boy) be mine forever.
In the groove (that boy) and leave me never.
In the mood (oh joy) give me some kissing.
You know it won't be long
before you're in the mood!

Don't be rude, I love you madly.
It's up to you, I'll take you gladly.
Love is blind, my vision's hazy.
It didn't take me long to say
I'm in the mood!

Do ba do ba do bop boo da da day.
Ba da-n-da da-n do da-n do day.
Who's that guy with the beautiful eyes?
'N' look at those lips, I'd try 'em for size.
Hey! Swing with me!
What a wing it'd be!
May I intrude? It's time to dance
and I'm in the mood!

Oh, hold me darling, let's dance.
What a dreamy romance.
It's a quarter to three.
There's a mess-o-that moon.
Let's share it with me.
You know, I think it's rude
to keep me this way
when I'm in the mood.
I'm in the mood, in the groove!
In the mood, ah, ah, ah!

Man-oh-man, wow!
Like, you really got me lookin'.
Oh, and you really got me cookin', oh!

My heart went flip, my brain went skip.
I said c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
I'm hot now! Oh boy! I love you madly!
Right now! Oh boy! I'll take you gladly!
Tight now! Oh boy! I'll be in!
And now I'm really in the mood, boy!

Rompin'! Stompin'! Smokin'!
Why don't we go somewhere and smooch, boy?

It's got to be right now!
It's gotta be right now!
It's got to be right now!
I'm only saying that it didn't take me long,
didn't take me long, didn't take me long
to say I'm in the mood.
Your flat foot floozy wants a good boy!
