I don't need no one to tell me how to feel the beat
And I don't need no beat to tell me how to move my feet

Just go and do what you do 'cause there's nothin' to prove

I'm just bein' me watch me do me
I don't need no magazine to tell me who to be
And I don't need to pose for p-p-p-paparazzi

Just keep the cameras flashin', to try to catch this action

I'm just bein' me w-watch me do me, me, me, me



Light up the floor, play me one more

Let me hear that

Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before

Let me hear that

Bass drop on the boombox, make your heart stop, feel the room rock!

I'm doin' all I want to do, and I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me



I don't need no music when I wanna sing a song
I don't need what's popular to know what's right or wrong

I'm busy burning the track, not holdin' anything back

I'm just bein' me w-watch me do me, me, me, me



Light up the floor, play me one more

Let me hear that

Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before

Let me hear that

Bass drop on the boombox make your heart stop

Feel the room rock!

I'm doin' all I want to do and I won't stop until I can't move

I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me



I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go

L-let, l-let it, l-l-let it explode
I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go, to go!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!



Light up the floor, play me one more

Let me hear that

Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before

Let me hear that

Bass drop on the boombox make your heart stop

I'm doin' all I want to do and I won't stop until I can't move

I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me

Watch me; do me, me, me

Watch me, watch me!
