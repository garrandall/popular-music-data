Every day without love
Is a day of sorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow
To wait for love is just
To waste your life away

Dreams come true and if you
Get too far behind them
Someone else will find them
To wait for love is just
To waste your life away

So press your lips
Against my lips
And thrill me with the
Warmth of your caress

The time for love is late
So please don't wait
Together, we can
Find happiness

I know that
Every day without love
Is a day of sadness
Let me bring you gladness
To wait for love is just
To waste your life away

Hear what I say
Tomorrow
True love may fly away
Fall in love today

Fall in love today

To wait for love is just
To waste your life away
