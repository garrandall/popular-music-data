Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Woah!
Woah, woah, oh
You good, T-Minus?
Oh


Me meet me at The London (London)
If you find time, we can run one (Run one)
Talk about some things, we can't undo (Undo)
You just send the pin, I can find you (You)
6'1" on the money, 9'2" (9'2")
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah I knew


Yeah
Circumnavigate the globe, as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked, like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick, run 'em with the big slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishing, this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face and say I ain't the hottest
Nigga you done never heard
I left a flock of rappers dead and burned
A verse from me is like eleven birds
I did the math it's like 2000 dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
And told them niggas that they gotta wait for me
I know, I know you in high demand
I'm balling on a pussy nigga like Jauwanna Mann
I'm drowning all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man (Ayy, ayy)


Me meet me at The London (London)
If you find time, we can run one (Run one)
Talk about some things, we can undo (Undo)
You just send the pin, I can find you (You)
6'1" on the money, 9'2" (9'2")
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah I knew


Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead the ritual (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter
I'ma run the compound (Yeah), I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woah)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Quarter and she fled)
I'm in the Lamb so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shortie's light brown eyes (Oh)
I'm at The London with some big thighs
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Did your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aww yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of sprinters at Stop and Go's (Yeah)
I could charge them like a Dodge in a demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen (Woo)
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they wan' start
And we leave them on the cement (Grrat, grrat)


Me meet me at The London (London)
If you find time, we can run one (Run one)
Talk about some things, we can undo (Undo)
You just send the pin, I can find you (Find-find-find)
6'1" on the money, 9'2" (9'2")
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew (I knew)
I knew, I knew, yeah I knew

Aight, crushed down when you're mine (Yeah)
44 times when you won't play (Yeah, side)
44 side (Yeah)
89 fly, I might (Fly)
I might, see you one time,
Get down, might
See this whole town, every time, I (Woah, woah, won't play, I)
Yeah, they know what's up (Woah, won't play)
