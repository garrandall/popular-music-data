Pink it's my new obsession 
Pink it's not even a question, 
Pink on the lips of your lover, 'cause 
Pink is the love you discover 

Pink as the bing on your cherry 
Pink 'cause you are so very 
Pink it's the color of passion 
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion 

Pink it was love at first sight 
Pink when I turn out the light, and 
Pink gets me high as a kite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight 

You could be my flamingo 
'Coz pink is the new kinda lingo 
Pink like a deco umbrella 
It's kink - but you don't ever tell her 

Pink it was love at first sight, and 
Pink when I turn out the light 
Pink gets me high as a kite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight 

I want to be your lover 
I wanna wrap you in rubber 
As pink as the sheets that we lay on 
Pink it's my favorite crayon, yeah 

Pink it was love at first sight 
Pink when I turn out the light 
Pink it's like red but not quite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight
