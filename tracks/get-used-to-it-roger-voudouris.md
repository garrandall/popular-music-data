I did not know what you were about
Something called love made me want to find out
Did not think you could ever care
But I'm outta control
'Cause you're takin' me there

I couldn't believe our love would last
It's comin' on strong, girl
Comin' on so much faster

Get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love

Get used to it
Don' t let me down
You pulled me in
So don't turn me around

You didn't hesitate
And told me just how you feel
Well there ain't no mistake
This time it's for real

I didn't believe our love would last
It's comin' on strong, girl
Comin' on so much faster

Get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love, please

I'll be around you because I'm crazy about you
I'll be around you, baby, you know I can't live without you
I'll be around ya, baby, 'cause I'm hungry for your love

So you better get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
Yeah, ya better get used to
All my love, please
Ya, better get used to
All my love, baby
Ya, better get used
To our love
