Life
Live it
You only get one

Make a couple dollars think you cool till your kids getting followed after school
We ain't never followed rules
I just want the crib that got the pool
Niggas jumped him he went home and got his tools
Shorty fed up
Everything on the line
You either die or give that bread up
This the mafia so don't be embarrassed walk with your head up
Youngin with an opinion the OG's told me to shut up
You tryna open shop go get a gun before you set up
Shots will give your body a physical fuck a check up
I know yankees fan that will kill you cause the Mets up
Never will I let up
The girls that couldn't talk on the phone giving that head up
How much of this can we measure
No scale I was eyeballing that Prada
Watched a couple of niggas die over that Prada
I got high and I forgot it
Magnum on me, Lil had the charge nigga we dodged it
Malik was all about bitches on some Chico Debarge shit
Henny drunk it straight, We wouldn't mix a drink
Bando waking me out my sleep I'm off a perk in front 
Now when it get cold I just hope my daughter could fit her mink
The hottest in NY I could give a fuck what you niggas think
Gelato smell it on us, We pull up they like them niggas stink
You not a boss niggas still sending you to go get a drink
I told Mac empty that shit if you nigga blink
Selling grams, Cam had me wanting to get it pink
When Pegisus was open we born into this shit
Niggas chosen, seen niggas lose their life over clothing
I told shoota we gonna get rich no matter what
They was happy when we was down now we see them they mad as fuck
We ain't gotta live in the projects no more
I dropped out, But its funny I'm hitting college on tour
I need them fresh, cop them again if I copped them before
Charlotte Hornets top and bottom colored
Aqua Valore
Ocky use to let me in after the locks on the door
I ain't speedin I ain't smoking Fuck you stopping me for
I hid my first 38 behind the socks in my Drawers
My momma asked me why you gotta gun
You not going to war
If I go get a cigarette they might be ops at the store
I'm serving with no tennis net I might stopped by the law
Pooch said he paranoid, he has some rocks in his drawers
They on a mission kill a witness and they all might get off
I keep some money on my phone just cause the bro might've called
Might die speaking outta term
Niggas don't know when to talk
We do it big
Fuck a pig
Cook my food with no pork
Just tryna win cause I ain't really in the mood for no loss
You can't be scared of the night already knew it got dark
Keep it trill and try to build that's what I do when I talk
A month of rent just for the heels
Looks at her as she walk
I'm tryna listen honesty
I'm just not choosing to talk
The Maybach just got washed
Take off your shoes in my car
Them niggas that never supported
Act like you been a star
Wine sipping, Twisting Cigars
I'm watching steven
Thinking I ain't need a dollar from niggas just need a call
Ask me how I'm doing, Communication out the window
That how shit get ruined
I won't go unless my crew in
I always been a student
I roll with a bunch of devils in blue
I'm on some Duke shit
Got bitches on some Luke shit
Took Xanax out my diet
Cause it use to make my mood switch
Live or die It ain't up to you
Allah gon' choose it

Live or die It ain't up to you
Allah gon' choose it

Live or die It ain't up to you
Allah gon' choose it
