Talk to me
Lately, you've been running away from me
Don't you think you're acting too tough?
I don't want to put it off another day
Do you think I'm asking too much?
Talk to me, baby, converse with me now
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me you love me, show me now
You know I really think you oughta
Rhythm and romance seem to fade away
I know we've been needing a change
It just don't get it when you put all day
'Cause you know you're my everything
And I can't wait, come on
Talk to me, baby, converse with me now
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me you love me, show me now
You know I really think you oughta
Now is the time to let your love show
Tell me now, let me know
Girl, there's a lot to build our love on
Don't delay, hurry
I think I'll call her up
Yeah, I'll call her up now
Come on, I know you're home
Answer, pick it up
Talk to me, baby, converse with me now
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me you love me, show me now
You know I really think you oughta
Talk to me, baby, talk to me, girl
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me you do love
You know I really think you oughta
Talk to me, baby, converse with me now
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me you love me, show me now
You know I really think you oughta, baby
Talk to me, baby, converse with me now
You know I really think you oughta
Tell me you love me, show me now
You know I really think you oughta
It would be so nice if you'd treat me right
Talk to me, girl
