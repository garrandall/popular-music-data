How old are you - tell me what's your story?
How are old are you - tell me when did you start?
Are you in it for the money and the glory?
Do you still have the brains, the guts, and the heart?

When you were younger you were so much better
When you were younger you were really hot
Hey, but now you're much older and you're you're colder than ever
Why won't you hang it up, why won't you stop?

How old are you?
How 'bout some facts and figures
How old are you?
How about a little background
Is it true you call back people niggers?
How come you're always clownin' around?

How come you don't try to write a novel?
How come you don't try to write a play?
Isn't it time you died or retired?
Why the hell won't you just go away?

How old are you?
Are you crazy?
How old are you?
Are you really a drunk?
Are you better - have you grown lazy?
Were you embarrassed about "Dead Skunk"?

How come you didn't get big like Bob Dylan?
How come you didn't get big like Springsteen?
Were you unable or were you unwilling?
Tell us the truth about it, c'mon, come clean

How old are you?
How old are you?
How old are you?
How old...?

When you were younger you were so much better
When you were younger you were really hot
Hey, but now you're much older and you're you're colder than ever
Why won't you hang it up, why won't you stop?

How old are you?
Who do you live with?
How old are you?
Who was your wife?
Is it true that you have children?
I guess that means that you got a sex life

Well, that's about all - I seem to have run out of questions
There's only a few and they're always the same
You know we got to sell paper and tickets and records
So we can keep on playing this show business game

How old are you?
How old are you?
How old are you?
