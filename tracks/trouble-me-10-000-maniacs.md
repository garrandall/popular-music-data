A little bread, a little circus
It serve as a diversion for devils and death merchants
I was curled up underneath the swirling threat of reds and purples
Lumberjack flannel, strapping saddles over servals
Paddling in circles with 10,000 maniacs in yankee caps
Who get to know the neighbors every time they tip the ladle back
Rag tag cats and canines who catch phat tags on the fabric of space time
All work no play, dull boys rotate
Old Boy, Ghostface, Tolstoy, Coltrane
Throws up coffin nails, off the rails
Born bathed in a tornado of claws and tails
Got skulls on his sails, cobras on the pleather
Salt and pepper soldiers barely holding it together
But supposedly awoke and down to mobilize whenever
You're pretty much a Gomer Pyle to pester, remember
I'm Pop-O-Matic trouble, I will commander the goulash
Under hockey hair, zoom off on a blue ox through the blogosphere with poppies for your mama bear
Carrots for the vitamix, kibble for the puppy, something bloody for the firebit
Never mind the appetizer writhing in the spider web
Stare into it long enough you biters just might find yourselves
Tea with the dark side, Slimer on speed dial
Sleep on a couch or a street or a leaf pile
Our kind can not be redeemed
I'm a cancer on the glamor, I can't with the "Me Me Me"
No anesthesia, surgeon with the signal jammer scrambling the feed
Distributing the panacea free, all day
There is no amount of Our Fathers that could remedy the black dog breathing down his collar
Mi casa like I'm Oscar, hot and popping out a flipped lid
Eyepatch, Prince wig, disappearing grid blip
Stiff lip, sure to shit talk a centurion, tsk tsk, I don't really wiggle with invertebrates
Purp in the thurible, off sides, toss thine merch in the urinal
It's nothing personal
Dirtbag don, don't provoke him to act up
I'm golden doing donuts in the Totoro cat bus
Everything I touch turn to black sludge
Bugs in the bag lunch, punch through a mack truck
Hunchback, get y'all acquainted with the contagion
Nobody safe, say hello to well beyond containment
I came for every cell between the belfry and the basement
You maybe wanna telephone your favorites
We take it where the warlocks lock horns, soda pop, popcorn
Top notch gore set to Bach over fog horns
Snotty nose, clogged pores, fork in his heart
Back away or catch a halo made of orbiting stars, yea
Transform in the dark, got a dog nose sniffing out the source of the snark
Got a cat's ears twitching every snap of a twig
Triangulate your position, a simple rabbit to skin
I been an echo in the dark who demo applied science at the parlay
Barf rainbows and cry diamonds, ok
Ready Freddy, headlong into creeping death
Respawn where you least expect
I could pick a pin and tumbler right in front of the guard
Out the front with another Picasso under his arm
Hit the city limit still exhibiting his inner Caulfield, baby
I'm H.E. double hockey sticks on wheels
New dawn, show 'em how the voodoo doll feels
Plus launch fireballs from the palm heels
On an otherwise slow day, this is how I row into the rogue wave, yo
