Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ha-ah-ah, mmm
Ha-ah-ah, ah...

Two people, just meeting, barely touching each other
Two spirits, greeting, tryna carry it further
You are one, and I am another
We should be one, inside each other

You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?
You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?

Two strangers - not strangers - only lacking the knowing
So willing, feeling - infinite growing
While we're here, the whole world is turning
We should be one, fulfilling the yearning

You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?
You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?

You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?
You can see inside me - will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?

Inside me
You can come inside me... (Inside my love...)
(Inside my love...) You can come inside me
(Inside my love...) Will you come inside me? (Inside my love...)
You can come inside me... (Inside my love...)
Will you come inside me? (Inside my love...)
You can come inside me
(Inside my love...) Will you come inside me?
You can come inside me... (Inside my love...)
Will you come inside me? (Inside my love...)
You can come inside me... (Will you come inside me?)
Will you come inside me?
