When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that can make me smile

I made up reasons to go

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
Well, I ask her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

See what life's gonna hold

Her momma wants to know
Am I washed in the blood or just in the water?
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Before he could let her go

And now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one

Her momma wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water?
And I wanna know
That he makes enough to take my daughter

When it comes time to go

You know I wanna help her go

Down, down, down that road
Down, down, down that road
