When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that could make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
And I asked her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold
Down the road

Her momma wants to know
If I'm washed in the blood or just in the water
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Down the road
Before he can let her go
Down the road

Now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one

Down the road

Her momma wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water
And I wanna know
That he makes enough to take my daughter

Down the road
When it comes time to go
Down the road

Down the road
You know I wanna help her go
Down the road

Down, down, down that road

Down, down, down that road
