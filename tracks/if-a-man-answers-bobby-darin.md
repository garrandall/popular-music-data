If a man answers your phone when I call
Oh.. there's gonna be some screamin'
And that ain't all
'cause if I'm here callin' you
Then who's the who I'm talkin' to?

Why any fool could see
That for sure it ain't me
So, if a man answers your phone
Then, honey we're through!

Now... everything between us used to be fine
Till I became a third party
Where there ain't no party line
Ya hear me talkin'...

Gonna hang this phone up now and dial again
Oh.. and there better be a soprano
On the other end
'cause if the voice is baritone
When you told me you'd be home alone.

Well... then I'm wastin' my time
A-not to mention my dime
So, if a man answers your phone
Then, honey I'm gone!

Now... everything between us used to be fine
Till I became a third party
Where there ain't no party line
Ya hear me talkin'...

Gonna hang this phone up now and dial again
Oh... and there better be a soprano
On the other end
'cause if the voice is baritone
When you told me you'd be home alone.

Well... I'm wastin' my time
Not to mention my dime
So, if a man answers your phone
Then, honey I'm gone!
