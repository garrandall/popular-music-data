See the clouds adrift so far below
Everchanging as they come and go
Makes me wonder why I'm up so high
When really I am down so low

Of all the wonders I was one allowed
I think that I would always choose a cloud
Always brings my feelings right out loud
Whether I'm ashamed or proud

On this airplane comin' home to you
Sometimes I think I've flown my whole life through
My whole life...through
As I wing my way to you

See the clouds they're giving life below
In colors that the canvas cannot show
Keeping secrets no one else could know
For I'm the one who told them so

Now and then I get up close to you
I'd like to stay but I'm just passing through
So I'll have to say goodbye
Until next time I fly

Make my bed-light the light
Comin' in on the midnight flight
Touch the ground and soon you will be
Safe inside reality

Change your mind-change your name
Still the music it sounds the same

Rainfall don't bother me at all
You see the world reflected in the highway
Come on rainbow-I can't let you go
Before I reach the end of you someway

So the next time raindrops fall
If it makes you climb the walls just think of green
