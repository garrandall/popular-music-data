She seems a million miles away
When she walks by you don't know what to say
You gonna make a move, you better make it now
Don't be afraid, cause love will show you how

You take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know step by step
Step by step
You'll win her love

She looks too beautiful to touch
But your heart keeps talking to you now
Don't give up
You think you see something in her eye
But you will never know until you try

But you gotta take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know that step by step
Step by step
You'll win her love

Second step...
Third step...
Don't you know step by step
Step by step

First step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know that step by step
Step by step
You'll win her love

Second step...
Third step...
don't you know step by step
Step by step

First step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know that step by step
Step by step
You'll win her love
