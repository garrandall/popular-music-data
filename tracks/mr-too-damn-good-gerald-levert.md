Guess you never know a good thing
When itâs right in your face
Youâve been abused for so long
Love gets tainted and it all seems the same
I guess itâs unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well time ainât no object and money ainât a thing
When you have someone to ease the pain


Let me be the smile on your face
And be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed
And baby Iâll be your fool
Mr. Too Damn Good To You

Yes sir, hmm
Youâve been hurt so many times
You donât when loveâs for real
So you donât open up
Or give in to love
Or express how you feel
But just like Sunday Morning
I take it easy
Girl Iâm gonna wait
Cause love it just ainât right
Without you by my side
Baby youâre my soul mate
Baby Iâll open doors
Be there for you any time
Cause thatâs what your manâs supposed to do
I wanna cook for you
I will spoil you

Girl my whole objective is to please you
Iâll run your bubble bath
Make you laugh
Girl through thick and thin I got your back
I ainât gon be pressinâ you or stressinâ you to make love
We got so much time for that



Baby, baby
I wanna be your shoulder when you need one to cry on
Hmm-hmm yeah
I wanna be your pillow when you need one to ly on, oh yeah
I wanna be the spot light that shines on ya
Girl I wanna write the girl is mine on ya, yes I am
I wanna be your thought in your daydreams
I wanna be your everything, your everything
(Mr. Too Damn Good To You)
I wanna be everything you ever thought you wanted
(Mr. Too Damn Good To You)
Ever needed baby, yeah
Girl I wanna shout about it
You wanna tell the world about it
(Mr. Too Damn Good To You)
And canât nobody else believe me
Youâll have everything youâve needed, yeah, yeah
(Mr. Too Damn Good To You)
Iâm gonna be so so good to you
