Another sleepless night I can't explain
Somebody said they heard me call your name
The radio won't let you leave my mind
I know it's over, but I don't know why

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you (Oooo)

Well there was no risk that I wouldn't take
And not a promise that I didn't make
All I asked was that you just hold on
Now I'm wondering what I did wrong

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

I gave you all of my body and soul
(I gave you all of my body and soul)
Never believing we might lose control
(Never believing we might lose control)
I took my hands off the wheel
(I took my hands off the wheel)

I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
Well I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you
