There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still


There's the place I love to be
Momma daddy my sister & me
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still


There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still


When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes
No matter where I am
And just be still


There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still
