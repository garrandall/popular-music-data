Haters so sad
KKK, KKK

Young nigga I got new money, I got new hunnids
I got old cap, pink 50's and I got blue hunnids
Toolie go to thumpin' jump out bustin'
Foolies go to runnin'
Boy don't play with me, ion't play with kids
Better go to school or somethin'
Boy don't play with me, ion't play with kids
And nigga I shoot for fun
Money moves, these bloody shoes
I'm trippin' Christian Louboutin
Excuse me son, I beg your pardon
Get from round me, smoke a flock
This is draco, this a baby choppa
I've been so angry docta'
Drop 8 ounces in my baby bottle, baby bottle pop
I don't Nae Nae, I don't milly rock
Baby I just Kodak Bop, I do no flock
I don't really do no feature, nigga I don't need no swap
I don't eat no broccoli, no mo' 'cause doc I smoked a canteloupe
I'm smoking KK, you smoke BB
I shot Dae Dae with a BB
I'm spazzin' on their asses fast so much got muscle spasms
My haters proud of me, 'cause obviously I'm who they tryin' to be
Make it so damn hard to copy they still try to copy me
Mouth full of gold since 10 years old I hit a lick up top for these
Everybody watchin me, jockin' my flows
Catch 'em out there went and dropped diamond teeth
If they ain't permanent pull 'em out your teeth
Hop out with Shotgun Pete
Hoppin' up out the Jeep
Hoppin' out, hop, hoppin' out with the heat
Pimpin' bitches, I be trickin' freaks
Tricked them for the treat
And I keep a mask on like it's Halloween
Er'yday Halloween, C'est La Vie
Nigga, what you say about me?
You ain't even in my league
Can't let you intervene
This orange codeine right here, that's yellow lean
Definitely, I can do the beat again and again
Right now, if I please
Cheddar please, I'm 'bout my chedda' cheese
Give my chedda' please
'Specially, I got the melody
I got the recipe
I hop out every scene, I caught no felonies
Fuck a nigga mean?
My bitches yellow
But oranges be fittin' me better, she sweeter than tangerine
Glock 23, came with a drum every gun I got a tambourine
Orange Balenciaga
I'm so unique, but my swagger mean
Arms Balenciaga
Nigga, you can't tell if that is me
I just got these bands for free
Poking one as I cut my sleeve
Baby, that's make believe
Maybe that's made with lean
She said, maybe that's Maybelline
Baby, that's made with lean
Tramp do you want a lil' trampoline
I be concrete in these skreets
Poke on one, I cut my sleeve
Baby, that make believe
Maybe, that's made with lean
She say, maybe that's Maybelline
Orange soda, that's my favorite drink
That my favorite lean
Orange soda, that my favorite drink
That my favorite lean
Orange soda, orange everything, orange everything
Bodak Orange, Kodak anything
Orange everything
Woo, glee
