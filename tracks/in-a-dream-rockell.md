Sweetheart, I can't stop thinking about you

You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams

Never in my dreams
I thought I'd be with you
You're often on my mind
I'll always love you
When I close my eyes
Just to see your face
I wish this were real
But I'm just dreaming
I can't believe that
This is all in a dream
I'm gonna wait to be
With you my love
I'll always love you
And want you more
I can't go on
Without your love

In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart

OOOOO, what an angel
You have to be
You'd take me to heaven
Never leave never go away
Please stay with me tonight
I need you with me
Can't believe that
This is all in a dream
I'm gonna wait to be
With you my love
I'll always love you
And want you more
I can't go on
Without your love

In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart
In a dream my love
You will find my heart
...You will find my heart
