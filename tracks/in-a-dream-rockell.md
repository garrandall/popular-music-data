What is this?
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music
Sweet!


And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
(You're all that I need to get by)


I used to play hard to get, like a sample on a hook
We used to play with the pots, you told me you was a cook
I was runnin' too long, he was chasin', didn't trip
How'd he do it? I don't know but somehow I got hooked
Thug passion, he's so compassionate
MMG, yeah, that's his acronym
Call him D-A-D-D-Y, like I'm in a bassinet
He's in pieces, he be all up into my fashion shit
Poppin', rockin', my panties, they match my slips
Been through it all; I could give a narrative
No fiction, nah, we ain't no characters
I mean if I bust my gun, you gon' bust yours too
Type to double up, you know that I ain't gon' fuck the buddy up
Type of bitch deserve it all, who gon' compete with her?
He use to have a cold heart (cold heart)
Now my ring finger doin' the double dutch


And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
{You're all that I need to get by}
(You're all I need)
Dream together, scream together
(You're all I need)
And if we go to war, fuck the world together
(And if we go to war)
And I'll be loving you forever
(Fuck the world together)
(You're all that I need to get by)
You're all that I need to get by
(You're all that I need to get by)
You're all that I need to get by
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)


Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in a Maybach, yeah


Caramel, she ride on top like it's a carousel
So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my magnum opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps like we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my piÃ±a colada
Put my coattail on my dog; I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire, just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy
If it's the Lord's will, so be it, that boy been a 'G'
That boy been a 'G'


You're all I need to get by
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in a Maybach, yeah


She full of confidence, we compliment each other
Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both went in, that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started singin' tracks
Once was a dependent on the income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it made me off a couple racks


You're all I need to get by
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in the Maybach, yeah


There go that nigga
Swim with the big fish
It's that Chanel music
That Givenchy

Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Givency
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in the Maybach, yeah

It's priceless
I'd rather you than me
That's all it is

You're all I need to get by
