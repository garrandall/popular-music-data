I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
Iâm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when youâre gonna let me in
Iâm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that Iâve been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
Iâm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when youâre gonna let me in
Iâm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why donât we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why donât we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know

(Some - where)

And if you have a minute, why donât we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why donât we go? So why donât we go?

And if you have a minute, why donât we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why donât we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
