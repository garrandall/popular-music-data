It must be your skin I'm sinking in
It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why

Everything's gone white
Everything's gray
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

Don't let the days go by

Glycerine
Glycerine

I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
Are you at one or do you lie?
We live in a wheel
Where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields

I treated you bad
You bruise my face
Couldn't love you more
You got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by

Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me

Don't let the days go by

Don't let the days go by

Glycerine

Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
And she falls around me

I needed you more
You wanted us less
Could not kiss just regress
It might just be
Clear and simple and plain
Well, that's just fine
That's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you
