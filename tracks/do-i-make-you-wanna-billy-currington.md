Baby what's on your mind,
When you see me pull up to your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown,
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country,
and maybe blow all our money
on some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy.
And tell me now,

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light,
Go to Vegas, stay up all night,
See if we can find a cheap flight,
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice?
Do I make you feel pretty,
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me,
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show.
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now?
We can take it back downtown,
You know I don't care now.
Just wanna take you there now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Broadway?
Tell me do I make you wanna
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth.
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,

Baby,

Go flyin' down a two lane road.

Ah, babe, tell me,
Do I make you wanna?
