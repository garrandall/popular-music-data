Oh, oh, say my name, and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now


I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said-a I (I) don't (don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery


Oh, oh, oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, free love on the streets, but
In the alley it ain't that cheap now


I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said-a I (I) don't (don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery


Oh, oh, mmm, said-a, I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, you said-a
I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, I said-a
I don't care (I don't care)
You said I don't care (I don't care)
Said I (I) don't (don't) care (care), oh
I (I) don't (don't) care (no, I don't), oh
I don't care (I don't care)
I said-a, I don't care


I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said-a I (I) don't (don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
