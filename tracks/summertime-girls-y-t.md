Oh yeah, I
Just wanna watch the girls, goin' by
It's like poetry in motion
Against a hot summer sky

I'm in love, yeah yeah
At least every minute or two
Until' the next time a girl walks by
I think I love her too

Oh I, I can't help myself
But I just lose my head
Every time you see 'em walkin' by

Summertime girls
(You make my whole world go around)
Summertime girls
(When you lift me up)
(I never come down)

She's hot
I dig her wiggle and all that shake
You can read that body language, yeah
A million miles away

Sometimes I, yeah yeah
Come on just a bit, a bit too strong
But I just like to pretend, yes
That I can have 'em all

No time, time to catch my breath
So easily impressed
It doesn't matter if it's day or night

Summertime girls
You make my whole world go around
Summertime girls
(But when you lift me up)
(I never come down, no, no)

Come here girls
Summertime girls
(You make my whole world go around)
Summertime girls
(When you lift me up)
(I never come down, no, no)

Summertime girls
(Oh baby, you make my whole world go around)
Summertime girls
(The way you lift me up)
(I never come down, no, no)

Summertime girls
(Summertime girls)
Summertime girls
(You make my whole world go around)
Summertime girls
