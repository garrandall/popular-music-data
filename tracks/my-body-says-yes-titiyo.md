You-you got me...
You-you got me...
You-you got me...
You-you got me...

You-you got me...
You-you got me...
On my knees.

One sunday morning,
I was all alone,
When he called me up and said,
Meet me in the park tomorrow.

I didn't know what to say,
Never happened to me before.
And I don't even
Know his name,
But one thing is for sure,

Now listen,
I started singin' somethin'
I never sung before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.
I started singin' somethin'
I never sung before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.

My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me...

My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.

One monday morning,
I was lyin' in my bed.
Time was runnin' out and I wondered,
What am I supposed to do now?

Should I have known better?
Or should I go ahead?
Now you got me so confused,
That I wished that I was dead.

Now listen,
I started singin' somethin'
I never sung before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.
I started thinkin' stuff
That I never thought before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.

My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me...

My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.

Hey, hey-ey yeah...
You-you got me...

Now it's Monday evenin',
And I went down to the park.
? See him,
Standing with a brand new?

He whispered to me softly,
Do you wanna go for a ride?
And? doing this,
But one thing I can't hide, no.

Now we were doing things,
I've never done before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.
And would show me things,
That I've never seen before.
Na na na, na na.

What were these!


Lovin' what ya want,
Lovin' you're gonna get.
So don't ya bother worryin'
And don't ya bother sweat.

Lovin' what ya want,
And lovin' you're gonna get.
So don't ya bother worryin'
And don't ya bother sweat.

You're one in a million,
One of a kind, girl.

I wanna next to you,
I wanna feel your body heat.
You want my mind, heart,
Somethin' I want you to keep in mind,
I'm not gonna give you up,
I'm never gonna leave you behind.

Come on now,
Let me take you for a ride.
If you want love,
Then stay by my side.

I ain't got no money on a plastic card,
But the love I can give,
I know we can go far.

We going to places we've never been before.
When you say enough,
You're still gonna get more.
The feeling of love is all around everywhere.
Tonight is the night there's love in the air.

My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.
My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.
My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.
My body says yes,
But my mind says no.
You got me,
On my knees.
