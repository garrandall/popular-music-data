You know your baby's gonna leave you
If you don't treat her better
She's gonna hop that train and say bye-bye
You gotta run and tell the conductor


You gotta stop, get a ticket
You gotta stop, get a ticket
You gotta stop, get a ticket

You know your baby used to love you
Cause you wouldn't have no other
But she ran away and said bye-bye
And now she won't be your lover



You know your baby's gonna leave you
If you don't treat her better
She's gonna hop that train and say bye-bye
You gotta run, tell the conductor



Stop, get a ticket
Stop, get a ticket
Stop, get a ticket
Stop, get a ticket...
