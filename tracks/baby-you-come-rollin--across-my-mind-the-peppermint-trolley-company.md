Ev'ry now and then, I see you again
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
Every once or twice when feeling's kinda nice
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
Baby you come rollin' across my mind

Every other day, since you've been away
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
When I think I'm free if you sneak up on me
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
Baby you come rollin' across my mind

In the windows of the store
In the darkened pawn shop doors
In the pounding summer rain
You'll come back to me again

And when the feeling comes, it's like a thousand drums
Pounding in my heart, since we've been apart
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
Baby you come rollin' across my mind

In the morning aftermath
You'll come back and cross my mind

And when the feeling comes, it's like a thousand drums
Pounding in my heart, since we've been apart
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
Baby you come rollin' across my mind
