It's that time of the year
Summertime's almost here
Happiness is around the corner
It's that time of the year

Days are fun, nights with you, yeah
Nothing's bad, sure to do
Lazy nights is an epidemic
It's that time of the year
(It's that time of the year)

Sunshine every day
Paint your cares away
Let's spend every day together, yeah

We've been waiting so long
For this season to come
All the world is a lover's playground
It's that time of the year
(It's that time of the year)

It's that time of the year
Summertime's almost here
Happiness is around the corner
It's that time of the year

(It's that time of the year)
Every night under the stars
(It's that time of the year)
Every day, it's a miracle cause
(It's that time of the year)

One on condition with
Mother's permisison
(It's that time of the year)
Oh, I'll take you up and down
The boardwalk with small talk

(It's that time of the year)
On and on with happiness
As a guide, yeah
(It's that time of the year)...
