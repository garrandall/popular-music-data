Back then long time ago when grass was green
Woke up in a daze
Arrived like strangers in the night
Fab - long time ago when we was fab
Fab - back when income tax was all we had

Caresses fleeced you in the morning light
Casualties at dawn
And we did it all
Fab - long time ago when we was fab
Fab - you are my world you are my only love

And while you're in this world
The fuzz gonna come and claim you
But you mo better wise
When the buzz gonna come and take you away
Take you away
Take you away

The microscopes that magnified the tears
Studied warts and all
Still the life flows on and on
Fab - long time ago when we was fab
Fab - but It's All Over Now Baby Blue
Fab - long time ago when we was fab
Fab - like this pullover you sent to me

Fab
And You Really Got A Hold On Me
fab - long time ago when we was fab
