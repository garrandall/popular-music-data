My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong


I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?


Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong


I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?


So, baby, hold on to my heart, yeah
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?


I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
