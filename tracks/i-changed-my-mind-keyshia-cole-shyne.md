I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Kanye West on the track, by the way
Capital S, capital H, capital Y, capital N, capital E
There's this girl I know
So deep in love
Do almost any thing
To make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so so wrapped up
'Coz the average girl will give him
Anything that he wants
He's so caught up
He won't call her
He shows no love
'Til she decides
I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
It's the funniest thing
'Coz I know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never
Miss him so much
I bet, you he don't even notice
He don't even realize
'Coz he's
He's so caught up
He won't call her
He shows no love
'Til she decides
I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
I'm so over you
I got no more to give
I gave it all to you
And you couldn't handle it
And I don't care if you come back
To me on your knees
I just don't love you no more
I changed my mind
Speedin' on tha highway, gangsta lean
116, full steam, 'know I mean?
Bitches on my jock 'coz my flow is hot
An' they spot tha watch filled wit rocks from a block
When the light hit, strictly fish scale
Fuck that light shit
I nodge out tha garage double pipe shit
On Rodeo like, â€½Hey, yo, ma, I know you likes dis, haâ€
Capital S, capital H, capital Y, capital N, capital E
Wat y'all kno about G 4s, SL's wit automatic doors?
Flow sick, no shit, row 6, head crack
Walk tha street wit my chain out the frontin'
Fuck y'all niggas walkin' 'round like y'all sayin' sumthin'
I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Stop
Watchu thinkin' when you see me
On the corner an' you see me hangin' out
Wit tha niggas on tha block
What's it all about?
And stop
Watchu thinkin' when you see me
Comin' through and you see me
Wit tha niggas from tha corner
Comin' through?
And stop
I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
