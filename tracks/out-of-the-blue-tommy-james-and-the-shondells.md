I was so downhearted, baby, till I met with you.
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue.
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue.

Out of the blue into your arms,
Oh, I came out of the blue, leavin' the pain behind.
Just as if the rain was fallin', you came into view.
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue.
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue.

Out of the blue into a love,
So real, yeah! Out of the blue, how very strange it feels.
Everything was so unproven, till you pulled me through.
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue.
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue.

(doo doo-doo doo doo, doo-doo doo doo)
You passed my way, I asked your name.
And since that day I'm not the same.
I fell so hard for you, for every little part of you.

Oh, out of the blue into your arms,
Oh, I came out of the blue into your love just in time.
Everything was so unproven, till you pulled me through.
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue.

Out of the blue, baby, you took me out of the blue
Out of the blue, baby, you shook me out of the blue
repeat until fade out
