I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since


It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will


It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky


It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will


I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me "don't hang around"


It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will


Then I go to my brother, and I say, "brother, help me please"
But he winds up knockin' me back down on my knees
Lorâ€™, there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on


It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
