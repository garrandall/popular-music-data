I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river baby
I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time comin'
And I know a change is gonna come

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know
What's up there baby
Beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time comin'
And I know a change is gonna come

Then I go down to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he winds up
Knockin' me back down
On my knees

There've been times that I thought I
Couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able
To carry on

It's been a long, long time comin'
And I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will

It's been a long, long time comin'
And I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will

Well it's been a long, long time comin'
And I know a change is gonna come, change
I know it, I know it, I know, I know, I know
A change is gonna come
