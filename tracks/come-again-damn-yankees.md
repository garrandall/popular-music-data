I was a loner crusin' with the wind
I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
I had to leave you like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

Now I'm falling where I've never been
My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
like a long lost friend
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again

Yeah
Been so long since I've seen you girl
Swear I've been around the world
Every room is an empty space
In the darkness I see your face
Whoa Whoa Whoa 
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa

When I finally get my hands on you
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Lay you down, strip you bare
Make love to you till the morning comes around

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again
Come again
I said Lord 

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again

Whoa Whoa Whoa 
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa

Whoa Whoa Whoa 
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again
