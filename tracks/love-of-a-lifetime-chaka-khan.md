Love of a lifetime

Good for you (heart of change)
Got to be the heart of change
Good for me - a heart of change
I know we'll get it better
Stir it up (got to be)
Stir it tender heartedly
Stir it and
The whole world's gettin' better


I believe the world to be
Fast and ever changing
That's the way my love will be
Got to last and satisfy me


You got the love of a lifetime
You're such a rock steady lover, baby
Keep up the good love for Chaka
You can hold it, boy
'Cause you don't let it go

Good for you
Good for me
The way we work together
Short and sweet (hit and run)
I know where you're comin' from
We can steal
And baby, we'll hit and run together



We got the love of a lifetime
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby
Keep up the good love together
We can hold it, boy
And never let it go

We got the love of a lifetime
We got to keep on rockin' steady
I really think I'm ready now
Baby, I'm burnin', burnin', burnin'

You got the love of a lifetime
You're such a rock steady lover, baby
Keep up the good love for Chaka
You can hold it, boy, never let it go
We got the love of a lifetime
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby
Keep up the good love together
Hold it, boy

Love of a lifetime

(Love of a lifetime)
We got the love, we got the love
We got the love
Guess it's just a heart of change
We got the love, we got the love
We got the love
It's got to be a heart of change
We got the love, we got the love...
