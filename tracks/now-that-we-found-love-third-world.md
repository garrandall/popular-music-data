Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?

Make natty shook, make natty shook
Make natty shook, make natty shook
Make natty shook, shook, shook, shook all over the place

I say, come on, baby, when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, dance, dance
Come on, baby!

Say when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, get up and dance
Move yeah, I said move, yeaheah
I said come on, baby, let me show you what a, what a man can do

I said music, oh yeaheah
Is there soul into my soul
Moving all day long- to the rhythm doop doop doo-doo-day

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
What are we gonna do tell me, tell me what are we gonna do with love
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now, oho, that we found love what we gonna do with it

Let's give love a try
Let Jah control, control your destiny
We owe it to ourselves, yes, we do
To live happy eternally

Sweet love is what we've been searchin' for
And love is what we're lookin' for
Yeaheah, now that I've got it right here in my hand
I'm gonna spread it all over the land

Now!

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?

You've got to forgive and forget
Let hate, let hate be your enemy

Bow to the lord
And only love will set your spirit free

Oh, love is what we've been searchin' for
And sweet love is what we're lookin' for
Now that I got it right here in my hand
We're gonna share it all over the land

Now that we found love tell me what we gonna do with it
I really like to know, oho, tell me now

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found loveâ€¦
