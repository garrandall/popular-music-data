Mary mac, dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High to low, tip to toe
She broke a needle and she can't sew


Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon!


Asked my mama for fifteen cents
See the elephant jump the fence
He jumped so high he touched the sky
Never got back till the Fourth of July


Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon!


Baby, baby, quite contrary
Tell me, how does your garden grow
You got silver bells and you got cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row


Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon!


Oh ho
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Oh yeah
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Ohh!
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'


Ohh!
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
