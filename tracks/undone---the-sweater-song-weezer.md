 Hey brah, how we doin' man?
 All right
 It's been a while man, life's so rad!
This band's my favorite man, don't ya love 'em?
 Yeah
 Aw man, you want a beer?
 All right
 Aw man, this is the best. I'm so glad we're all back together and stuff.
This is great, man
 Yeah
 Hey, did you know about the party after the show?
 Yeah
 Aw man, it's gonna be the best, I'm so stoked! Take it easy brah!

I'm me
Me be
Goddamn
I am
I can
Sing and
Hear me
Know me

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

 Hey, what's up?
 Not much
 Did you hear about the party?
 Yeah
 Um, I think I'm gonna go but, um, my friends don't really wanna go. Could I get a ride?

Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-bye
Who I
I think
I sink
And I die

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away
(As I walk away!)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (as I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
It's good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

(If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away (as I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone)
