Can you feel me
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
Oh yeah
On the dance floor
Yeah yeah yeah
Lets play a game
On the dance floor
(Oh yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah

Let's play a game
Let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating
I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes
Trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels
Me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing
The way you got me going
Got me going outta brains
I see us going at it
Going in and out of them lanes

I don't want your innocence
I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment
I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number
Baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up
Looking like something you wanna


Tell me, what you thinking about
When you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you
That really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (You don't)
Cause baby you're invited (Baby)
I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (You don't)
Cause baby you're invited (Baby)


You're dreams fulfilled
You're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I'ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath
(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the boss, in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you
Look how I`ve studied every move, now I know you
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me
(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see
The passion's inside me, it's yours
Now come try me, c'mon


Tell me, what you thinking about
When your hands is all on me
Cause I've been thinking about
All the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
Cause you're sweepin' me off my feet

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it


I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (You don't)
Cause baby you're invited (Baby)
I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (Baby you're invited)
Cause baby you're invited (Baby)


I got a selection of the positions of affection
With no pressure
So tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of the positions of affection
With no pressure
So tell me
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it babe

Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it
