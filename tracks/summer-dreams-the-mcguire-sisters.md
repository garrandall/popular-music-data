Summer dreams
Where do they come
When winter comes
They're promises are gone
And still they linger on
Summer dreams built on a kiss
That taught me this
To heaven on a summer moon
Return to Earth too soon
Like bold honey bees
Steal their honey and fly
Like gold autumn leaves
Touch the frost and die
So my love was only true
When skies were blue
Yet I pray someday
Our love will come
With more than summer dreams


Like gold autumn leaves
Touch the frost and die
So my love was only true
When skies were blue
Our love will come
With more than summer dreams
