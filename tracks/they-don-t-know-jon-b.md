Pitbull in this! This Lil Jon Chekin in Where my T golds at! 

 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
You see that ass mommy got that's nasty!
The way she shake it make it drop that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
You see that ass mommy got that's nasty!
The way she shake it make it drop that's nasty

 
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO! 

 
Pitbulls chillin the bottom wit no deals 
If them boys talk alot then its no reals 
Shimmya yall shimmy yay shimmy yayo 
Catch me wit picolo riding on them thangs 
Word of mouf theres a drought on the streets 
So who ever sitting on them k's is looking at some cheezle 
But dont let them boys find out where the safehouse is at 
And if its where you lay your head, what kinda safehouse is that! 
You dont deserve to hold weight you deserve to get robbed 
Your the first to turn state 
Those who got snitched on relate to 
No matter what you do heffer damn gon' hate ya 
Thats just mother nature 
Aint she a mother 
I know theese bitches named bullets and they loved to date ya 
Or better said they love to rape ya 
From the bottom to A-town the game is ours now! 

 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 

 
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO! 

 
I from the land where you name it everythings crooked 
Watch what you do cuz, everythings looking 
Man theese streets got ears and eyes 
And they wanna know its all who what when and whyz 
So when you see me on them 24's spinning 
You know the cut me a serious check 
But for now I'm still grindin fiending for a legging 
Thats some serious shit ya 
I'm involved in some serious shit ya 
I'm like TI,I'm serious bitch 
I'm giving miami a facelift 
Yall just face it 
Dont believe its wrong just taste it 

 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty 
They spin when you stop that's nasty 

 
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO! 

 
When I came in mami you know you nasty 
Them bitch ass niggaz wanna blast me 
Still punkn' gettin crunked off that crunk juice 
Hatin cuz your girl on me and she hate you 
We gotta do nigga what cutlass dropped down on d'z 
If you pump it relocate your soul from the streets 
Remember me lil g A-town to the O (OOOO)
If you aint got no money I'm a get some from your hoe 
What you hate dawg? my dawg got rhymes on singing 
Get your hatin dawg, my twentyfo's keep spinning 
G'z up and whateva F down! 
Not a gat bring some money oh really? go act a clown 
Lay it up pimp get shot to the head 
But yall want my cutlass now I just want yo bread 
Sport a lil platinum B-C and B-B 
I'm thug nigga and you know this to the B! 

Dont hate the, the playa 
Dont hate the, the game 
Dont hate the, the playa 
Dont hate the, the game 

 
WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO! 

 
Twentyfo's on my truck that's nasty

They spin when you stop that's nasty
