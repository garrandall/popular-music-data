Are you ready? 

Everybody feel that rush
Nobody get too hush
Move like you stole it
Finesse and own it
Burn with the beat this hot
Girls put the boys in shock
Wangtang and snap that
180 bounce back

Let the rhythm steal away your body
This is how we party
Ohh, ohh, oh
We ain't playin'
Drop the bass, pliÃ© it
Come and get your rowdy on!

We are the outcasts, cool kids, loners
We are the live loud, hipster, shy nerds
Just know that this is right where you belong
Doesn't matter where you come from
Dance, dance like me!

Don't gotta act too cool
Everybody act a fool
Move like you stole it
Finesse and own it
Scared that you don't know moves?
Ima show you what to do
Wangtang and snap that
180 bounce back

Let the rhythm steal away your body
This is how we party
Ohh, ohh, oh
We ain't playin'
Drop the bass, pliÃ© it
Come and get your rowdy on!

We are the outcasts, cool kids, loners
We are the live loud, hipster, shy nerds
Just know that this is right where you belong
Doesn't matter where you come from
Dance, dance like me!

Hey! Come on! Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready
Let's go!
Heeeeeeey...

Dance like me
Like you, like he, like she
Everybody on the floor
Now 1, 2, 3, 4!

Dance like me
Like you, like he, like she
Everybody on the floor
Now 1, 2, 3, 4!

We are the outcasts, cool kids, loners
We are the live loud, hipster, shy nerds
Just know that this is right where you belong
Doesn't matter where you come from
Dance, dance like me!

We are the outcasts, cool kids, loners
We are the live loud, hipster, shy nerds
Just know that this is right where you belong
Doesn't matter where you come from
Dance, dance like me!
