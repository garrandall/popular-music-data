RESPECTABLE
THE OUTSIDERS

What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been kissed.
Rubbidy rub dub dub,
She's never ever been in love.
She's never been in the moonlight
Watchin' the stars above.
What kind of girl is this?
She's never been out on a date.
What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever come home late.
But I begged her on my knees to please go out with me.
And she did.
Did ya love her? (No, no, no, no!)
Did ya hug her? (No, no no no no!)
Did ya kiss her? (No, no, no, no!)
Did ya squeeze her? (No, no no no no!)
What kind of girl is htis?
She's never ever been kissed.
What kind of girl is this?
Let me tell you,
She's the kind you can't resist.
But I lover her, can't you see?
She's the kind of girl for me.
She's so respectable! (repeat and fade)
