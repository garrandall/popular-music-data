Yeah ladies I know you tired of the same old thing,
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is just so cold, so cold but I'm here to tell you
I got a strategy we bout to heat it up (O I like that)


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you neva done before
Baby not the usual tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy to roll with it baby... baby
Iâm a make you feel like you neva felt,
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable


Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you wit me
'C' ain't after 'A' and 'B' when you wit me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel
Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin neither is missionary
Positions girl, pick one, better yet some
Never mind that we tryin all the fun


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you neva done before (Yeahhh)
Baby not the usual tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy to roll with it baby (baby)
Iâm a make you feel like you neva felt,
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable


I know you're use to dinner and a movie
Why not be my dinner, while makin a movie
Do you get it get it
Do you got it got it
Good good good
Girl I knew you would
See what I got oveeer a lot of fellas is that I'm more Creeeative
And soon you will see what I mean, what I mean Sooo


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you neva done beforeeee
Baby not the usual tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy to roll with it baby (baby)
Iâm a make you feel like you neva felt,
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable


All Aboard!
The spontaneous express
Never the less always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stops the G spot... LUDA! hahaha

Let me put a little bit of excite-ment
Up in yo lifestyle
You gotta know the times of the essence
I'm talkin right now
I can get, get rid of that headache
What you doin tonight
Some say that sex is overrated, but they just ainât doin it right
I keeps it interestin baby just take them clothes off
I'll be yo Tylenol just take me till you dose off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin feelin like another giiirl


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you neva done before (done before)
Baby not the usual tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy... So tryyy to roll with it baby (baby)
Iâm a make you feel like you neva felt,
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable
