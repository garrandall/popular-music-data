Yeah ladies I know you tired of the same old thing
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is so cold, so cold but I'm here to tell you
I got a strategy--we bout to heat it up


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usually tonight we getting unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby... baby
I'mma make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable


Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you with me
C ain't after A and B when you with me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel
Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin', neither is missionary
Positions: girl pick one...better yet some
Never mind that we tryin' all of 'em!


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usually tonight we getting unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby... baby
I'mma make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable


I know you're used to dinner and a movie
Why not be my dinner, while makin' a movie?
Do you get it get it
Do you got it got it
Good good good
Girl I knew you would
See what I got over a lot of fellas is that I'm more creative
And soon you will see what I mean, what I mean


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usually tonight we getting unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby... baby
I'mma make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable


All Aboard!
The Spontaneous Express
Nevertheless, always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stop's the G spot... Luda!
(I like that!)
I like it too, baby
Let me put a little bit of excite-ment
Up in yo lifestyle
You gotta know that time's of the essence
I'm talkin' right now
I can get, get rid of that headache
What you doin' tonight?
Some say that sex is overrated, but they just ain't doin' it right
I keeps it interesting baby just take them clothes off
I'll be your Tylenol just take me till you doze off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feeling like another girl


Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usually tonight we getting unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby... baby
I'mma make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable
