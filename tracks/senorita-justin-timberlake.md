Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would I have you in the palm of my hand?


So why your love went away? I just can't seem to understand
Well babe, I've been around the world
Thought it was me and you until the end but I guess I was wrong


But you don't have to say, what you did. I already know. I found out from him


Now there's just no chance for you and me.
I'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it


What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around


Cry me a river


What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around


I don't want to lose you now
I know this can't be right but
Show me how to fight for now
Now it's time to leave and make it alone


Don't be so quick to walk away


'Cause I don't want to lose you now


I wanna rock your body 'til the break of day


It's like you're my mirror


And ohh, I've been driving on this road too long


My mirror staring back at me


Trying to find my way back home,
The old me's dead and gone (dead and gone)


I couldn't get any bigger


And ohh, I've been driving on this road too long


With anyone else beside of me ( trying to find my way back home)


The old me's dead and gone (dead and gone)

Hold up

Senorita, I feel for you


As long as you got that suit and tie
I'm a leave it all on the floor tonight


I'm bringing sexy back


Doing things that you don't have to


You got fixed up to the nines


Them other boys don't know how to act


Senorita, I feel for you


As long as you got that suit and tie
I'm a leave it all on the floor tonight


I'm bringing sexy back


Doing things that you don't have to


Like my dick in a box


Yeah
Wait what


Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two


It's tearing up my heart


You might hate me but it


Ain't no lie
Baby, bye bye bye bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough


It's tearing up my heart


Might sound crazy but


It ain't no lie, baby bye bye bye
