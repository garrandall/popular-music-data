Show me the meaning of being lonely
You are my fire, the one desire
Believe (is this the feeling I need to walk with)
I want it that way
Tell my why, ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell my why, ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell my why, tell my why I can't be there were you lay
There's something missing in the shape of my heart
Looking back to the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I play my part, kept you in the dark
And that makes you larger than life
All you people can't you see, can't you see,
How your love's affecting our reality,
Every time were down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger
Everybody yeah
Rock your body yeah
Everybody, rock your body right
Backstreets back alright
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake (I wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (hear you say)
I want it that way
Cause I want it that way
