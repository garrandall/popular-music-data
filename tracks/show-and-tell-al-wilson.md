These are the eyes
That never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms
That long to lock you inside every day

And every night
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Girl, and here is the soul of
Which you've taken control
Can'tcha see I'm tryin' to show love is right

Whoa, oh, oh, oh show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby

These are the hands
That can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight
(Anywhere in sight)

And these are the lips
That can't help callin' your name
In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)

Whoa
And here is the man
Who needs to know where you stand
Dontcha know I've done all I can
So decide

Whoa, oh, oh, oh show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby

Ah, here is the soul
Of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm tryin' to show love is right

Oh, girl, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby, baby
