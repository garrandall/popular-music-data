So
She says it's time she goes
But wanted to be sure I know
She hopes we can be friends

"I think
Yeah, I guess we can" say I
But didn't think to ask her why
She blocked her eyes and drew the curtains
With knots I've got yet to untie


What if I were Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with


See
It was just too soon to tell
And looking for some parallel
Can be an endless game

We
We said goodbye before hello
My secrets she will never know
And if I dig a hole to China
I'll catch the first junk to Soho


What if I were Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with


Sometime from now you'll bow to pressure
Some things in life you cannot measure by degrees
I'm between the poles and the equator
Don't send no private investigator to find me please
'Less he speaks Chinese
And can dance like Astaire overseas
Okay


What if I was
So, what if I was
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with


What if I was Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
Maybe she's just looking for
Someone to dance with
