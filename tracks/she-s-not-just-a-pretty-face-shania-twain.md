(Oh na, na, na, na, na)


She hosts a TV show
She rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band
She's an astronaut
A valet at the parking lot
A farmer working the land
She is a champion
She gets the gold
She's a ballerina
The star of the show


She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes


She has a fashion line
A journalist for "TIME"
Coaches a football team
She's a geologist
A romance novelist
She is a mother of three
She is a soldier
She is a wife
She is a surgeon
She'll save your life


She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's mother of the human race
She's not just a pretty face


Oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na


She is your waitress
She is your judge
She is your teacher
She is every woman in the world
Oh, la, la, la, la, la


She flies an airplane
She drives a subway train
At night, she pumps gasoline
She's on the council
She's on the board
She's a politician
She praises the Lord


She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's mother of the human race
She's not, oh


No, she's (She's) not (not)
Just a pretty face
She's (She's) got (Got) everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
