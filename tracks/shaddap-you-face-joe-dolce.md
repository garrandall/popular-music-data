'Allo, I'm-a Giuseppe
I got-a something special-a for you, ready?
Uno, duo, tre, quatro!

When I was a boy just about the fifth-a grade
Mama used to say: "Don't stay out-a late with the bad-a boys
Always shoot-a pool, Giuseppe going to flunk-a school!"

Boy it make-a me sick all the t'ing I gotta do
I can't-a get-a no kicks always got to follow rules
Boy it make-a me sick just to make-a lousy bucks
Got to feel-a like a fool
And-a mama used to say all-a time:

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect
What-a you t'ink you do? Why you look-a so sad?
It's-a not so bad, it's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!
That's-a my mama. I can remember!
Big accordion solo!
Ah-ha ! Play dat thing! Really nice, really nice!

Soon-a come-a day, gonna be a big-a star
Den I make-a T.V. shows and-a movies
Get-a myself a new car but still I be myself
I don't want-a to change a t'ing
Still a-dance and a-sing
I think about-a mama, and she used to say:

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect
What-a you t'ink you do? Why you look-a so sad?
It's-a not so bad, it's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!
Mama, she said it all-a da time!

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect
What-a you t'ink you do? Why you look-a so sad?
It's-a not so bad, it's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!
That's-a my mama!

Hello everybody!
'At's out-a dere in-a radio and-a T.V. land
Did you know I had a big-a hit-a song in-a Italy with-a this?
Shaddap-a you face, I sing-a dis-a song
All-a my fans applaud, dey clap-a da hands
Dat-a make me feel-a so good
You ought to learn-a dis-a song
It's-a real-a simple
See I sing: "What's-a matter you?" You sing: "Hey!"
Den I sing-a da rest and den at de end we can all-a sing
"Ah, Shaddap-a you face!"
Ok, let's-a try it, really big -
Uno duo tre quatro!

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect Hey!
What-a you t'ink you do? Hey! Why you look-a so sad? Hey!
It's-a not so bad. Hey! It's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!

That's-a great

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect Hey!
What-a you t'ink you do? Hey! Why you look-a so sad? Hey!
It's-a not so bad. Hey! It's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!

Ok, one time for mama. Everybody!

What's-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect Hey!
What-a you t'ink you do? Hey! Why you look-a so sad? Hey!
It's-a not so bad. Hey! It's-a nice-a place
Ah shaddap-a you face!
