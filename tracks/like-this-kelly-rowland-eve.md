Ladies and gentlemen
Kelly's back

Told you all I was gonna bump like this
You all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told you all I was gonna bump like this (uh-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
You all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told you all you all was gonna jump like this
How you not gonna know it when it hits like this

Ladies, drama, leave it - home
If he ain't got it right by now scratch him - off
They just called me
Said it's about - twenty strong
They standing at the door don't wanna take us - on
The ring let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain the stressinâ
Ainât in me no more
The girl that they used to know - done changed
Now they sayin' Ms. before they mention my name

Told you all I was gonna bump like this
you all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told you all I was gonna bump like this (uh-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
you all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told you all you all was gonna jump like this
How you not gonna know it when it hits like this

See satellite 664
Came up real slow
Put a good game on me
Told him partner don't get too close
So comfortable 'cause the quick ain't for me
Got my girls all here
With me so spare me please all your personal info
I ain't thinking about love
I just wanna get it up
Pop a bottle talk a lot of bullish and let's
Let's go

Told you all I was gonna bump like this
you all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told you all I was gonna bump like this (uht-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
you all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told you all you all was gonna jump like this
How you not gonna know it
Wait a minute mutha...

Oooh
Tonight ain't feeling no (stress)
To my girls that's lookin' their best (oooo)
Won't you go and show it off for us (yeah)
Ladies go and throw yo hands up (up)
And if he's all in your head
Just forget all the thangs that he said (uh)
Girl this is yours (uh)
Do whatever you want to (uh)
(yo, yo) Ladies go and throw yo hands up


Hear these words out my mouth now
Tell you how it's going down
Kelly E-v-e we comin' through and got âem bowinâ down
Ladies can you feel it
It's an athemn you can bounce around
Give you just a second take ya breath...(draws breath)
Bring it back now
Dudes get excited
Seein' what they like
Hopin' they the one you choose
Hope they get invited
Late night rendezvous is alright
But we lovin' how the club vibratin'
It's enticin'
Let the beat knock
Trust me we ain't gonna stop
Here 'til the light's up
Watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from the chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick with dough
Pop another bottle for them
Keep my life movin'
No time for the drama
Watch me blow through them
I know I sound confident
I'm sâposed to though
Do it big
How we live
Kelly told you so
C'mon

Now I told you all I was gonna bump like this
you all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told you all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around then I make it jump like this (All my ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this (uh-uh)
you all didn't think that I could make it bump like this (uh-uh)
See I told you all you all was gonna jump like this
How you not gonna know it when it hit like this
(How you not gonna know it when it... hit like this)
