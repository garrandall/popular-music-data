I've, I've been gone, I've been gone too long
Singin' my songs on the road, another town
One more show then I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door and

I'm gonna find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheet rock
Knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby like a wrecking ball

You, look at you, send me one more shot
Sittin' on a bathroom sink
Damn, you really turn me on
Painting your toenails pink
Easy baby for you to say
But if I can make it just one more day

That whole house is gonna be shakin'
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised
If the whole damn place just falls
Wanna rock you baby like a wrecking ball

And that old house is gonna be shakin'
Rafter rockin', foundation quakin'
Crash right through the front door
Back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby like a wrecking ball
