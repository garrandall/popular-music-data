I need you 


We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck âem both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you


Ahhh! Aye babe this my new shit
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missing
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
Z, wake up like I gotta get it
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she's no hablÃ©
But I make that bitch walk with some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Lookin in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'mma eat it, I'mma eat it
I won't lie, hope my dick's too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend
But don't be acting like I need you cause we poppin' like


Ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck âem both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you


I'm in a Rolls, you don't roll right
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motor boat, she gonna motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fucking
Money, decision-making only worried about stuntin
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffin'
I wanna see her body (bodyyyy)
And she said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby (yeahhh)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We lovin', she love it
Especially when I go down on her
Now we fucking, she thugging
Getting loud (cause we poppin' like)


Ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck âem both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you


Huh, look, alright
Now I can spot your bitch from a mile away
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
(Uh, you losin' money, I win mills Dr. J
She's gonna follow my lead, Simon Says)
Paper, paper, I'm riding scrapers in California
Car smell like ammonia, we got that stank on us
(Never been an outcast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia)
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
(In my section less niggas, more lesbians)
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga
(Yeah we poppin' like)


Ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck âem both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you


This that fly shit, King shit only
Drop top, no roof - ahhh!
