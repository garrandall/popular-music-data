I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you (Lemme see)
I need you, I need you


We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down
Screamin' like ayo
I'ma take her ass down if she bring her friend around
Fuck 'em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We poppin' like ayo
Ayo, ayo
But don't be actin' like I need you


Ha!
Ayy, babe, this my new shit (Shit)
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missin' (Missin')
If it don't make dollars, don't make sense (Sense)
Z (Z), wake up like I gotta get it (Get it)
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fuckin' bitches three ways
Seven different foreigns, plus she's no habl√©
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake (Cheesecake)
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Lookin' in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'ma eat it (Eat it), I'ma eat it (Eat it)
I don't lie, hold my dick, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend (For the weekend)
But don't be actin' like I need you


'Cause we poppin' like ayo (Ha! Yeah)
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down
Screamin' like ayo
I'ma take her ass down if she bring her friend around
Fuck 'em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We poppin' like ayo
Ayo, we poppin' like ayo
But don't be actin' like I need you


I'm in the Rolls, you don't roll right (Roll right)
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light (Yeah)
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike (Ha!)
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fuckin'
Money, decision-makin', only worried 'bout stuntin'
She worried 'bout me, her nigga worried 'bout cuffin'
I wanna see her body (Body)
Then she said, "Get inside of me
I wanna feel you, baby" (Yeah)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We lovin', she love it
Especially when I go down on her
Now we fuckin', she thuggin'
Gettin' loud


'Cause we poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down
Screamin' like ayo
I'ma take her ass down if she bring her friend around
Fuck 'em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We poppin' like ayo
Ayo (Huh, look), we poppin' like ayo
But don't be actin' like I need you (Alright)


Now, now I can spot your bitch from a mile away ('way)
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
Uh, you losin' money, I win mills, Dr. J (J)
She gon' to follow my lead, Simon Says
Paper, paper, I'm ridin' 'scrapers in California ('fornia)
Car smell like ammonia, we got that stank on us
Never been a Outkast, that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
Uh, and my section less niggas, more lesbians
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga


Yeah, we poppin' like ayo (Ha! Yeah)
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down (Yeah)
Screamin' like ayo
I'ma take her ass down if she bring her friend around
Fuck 'em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We poppin' like ayo
Ayo, ayo
But don't be actin' like I need you


Yeah, this that fly shit (I need you)
King shit only
Drop top, no roof, ha!
(I need you)
