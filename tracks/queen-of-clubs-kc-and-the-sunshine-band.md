In every night club across the nation
She’s the life of the party, she’s a real sensation
She’s got style, y’all, she’s got class
She can groove it slow or move it fast
In the early evenin’ through the midnight hour
She keeps swingin’, she’s got super power

She’s the queen of clubs
She’s the queen of clubs

If you throw a party and she ain’t there, well, well, well, well
People let me tell you that your party’s nowhere
From city to city and coast to coast
She’s more than hip now, she’s the most
Up in the mountains, out on the plains
Down in the valley they echo her name

She’s the queen of clubs
She’s the queen of clubs

Here she comes - fine lady
Oh oh oohohohh,ohoh

She’s the queen of clubs - out in the valley
She’s the queen of clubs
She’s the queen of clubs ...
