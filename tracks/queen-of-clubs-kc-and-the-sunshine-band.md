In every night club across the nation
Sheâs the life of the party, sheâs a real sensation
Sheâs got style, yâall, sheâs got class
She can groove it slow or move it fast
In the early eveninâ through the midnight hour
She keeps swinginâ, sheâs got super power

Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs

If you throw a party and she ainât there, well, well, well, well
People let me tell you that your partyâs nowhere
From city to city and coast to coast
Sheâs more than hip now, sheâs the most
Up in the mountains, out on the plains
Down in the valley they echo her name

Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs

Here she comes - fine lady
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sheâs the queen of clubs - out in the valley
Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs ....
