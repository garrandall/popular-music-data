Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
And I know you'll find your child memories there

So dream when the day is through
Oh, dream and they might come true
And things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream when you're feeling blue
And ooh, dream, that's the thing to do
And just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
And I know and I know
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Oh, dream and they might come true
Ooh, things never are as bad as they seem
So come on and dream, dream, oh, dream
Yeah, dream, dream, dream, oh, dream
