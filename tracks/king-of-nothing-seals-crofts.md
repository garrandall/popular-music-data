When I was 17, I dreamed of being king. And having everything I wanted.
But that was long ago and my dreams did not unfold, so I'm still the King of Nothing.
When I was 17, I dreamed I gave a ring to a pretty queen and then I held her.
But that was slumber's fault for I have no love at all. And I'm still the King of Nothing.

If I could rule, I'd dance my cares away, find romance everyday.
I wouldn't have to listen to this poor fool say,
"I'm the King, I'm the King, I'm the King of Nothing."
