Well I'm an axegrinder piledriver
Mother says that I never never mind her
Got no brains I'm insane
Teacher says that I'm one big pain
I'm like a laser 6-streamin' razor
I got a mouth like an alligator
I want it louder
More power
I'm gonna rock ya till it strikes the hour

Bang your head! Metal health'll drive you mad
Band your head! Metal health'll drive you mad
Well I'm remonstrated

Outdated I really want to be over-rated
I'm a finder and I'm a keeper
I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper
I got the boys to make the noise
Won't ever let up
Hope it annoys you
Join the pack
Fill the crack
Well now you're here
There's no way back

Bang your head! metal health'll drive you mad
Bang your head! metal health'll drive you mad
Metal health'll cure your crazy
Metal health'll cure your mad
Metal health is what we all need
It's what you have to have

Bang your head
Wake the dead
We're all metal mad
It's all you have
So bang your head
And raise the dead
Oh yeah!
Metal health
It's not too bad
Bad bad

Oh get your straight-jackets on tonight oh
Bang your head! metal health'll drive you mad
The bad boys are gonna set you right rock on rock on rock on
Bang your head! metal health'll drive you mad
Bang your head!
