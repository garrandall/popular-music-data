Oh, oh-oh

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Been payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it, too
But how I cried over losing you

See, I'm down and out
But I ain't about to go living my life without you
Hey, every day I made you cry
I'm paying, girl, till the day I die

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Been payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)

Oh, I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
If I had been a man in reality
You would be here, baby, loving me

Now my nights are long and lonely
And I ain't too proud, babe, I just miss you so
Girl, but you're too proud, and you won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Been payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)

(You, you, babe) My road is kinda long
(You, you, babe) I just gotta get back home

Whoa, I'm really sorry for actin' that way
I'm really sorry, oh, little girl
I'm really sorry for telling you lies for so long

Oh, please, forgive me, girl, come on (Give me a chance)
Won't you forgive me, girl, hey (Let's have romance)
Oh, forgive me, girl (Let's start again)
Come on, forgive me, girl
I want you over and over and over and over again

I keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Hey, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)

I keep (Working my way back to you, babe)
Yeah (Burning love inside)
(Working my way back to you, babe)
