Brooklyn, New York, July 4th, 1939 - A day for fireworks
Murder Incorporated received a contract to rub out Elliott Fress
Stuttering Sam Goldman gave the order:


Bomp-a-bomp-bomp...
Dang-a-dang...

The job was given to Babyface Latka, notorious East New York trigger man
As Fress stepped from his headquarters...
His gun still smoking, Babyface called
Stuttering Sam and gave his report:


Boogie, boogie, boogie, all night

Hearing the good news, Stuttering Sam rewarded
Him with Gangland's highest tribute:


You're my baby blue

But Elliott Fress was still alive
Murder Incorporated took care of Babyface
New York police found his body buried in:


A hundred pounds of clay

The following day, Canary Cone, another killer
Disguised as a messenger, delivered a small package
To the home of Elliott Fress
As the door opened, Canary sang:


This is dedicated to the one I love



Realizing he was in the wrong house
The killer looked down at his victim and said:


It's Pony time, get up!

Taken into custody, Cone made a full confession
Armed with this evidence, the Touchables
Surrounded a Brooklyn warehouse
Headquarters of Murder Incorporated
Fress called to Stuttering Sam:


Oh my darling, please surrender

From inside came the answer...

After a brief gun battle, Stuttering Sam stumbled
From the building, screaming:


That's it. I Quit

Aftraid he might talk, the National Crime Syndicate
Sent two killers disguised as police to the hotel where
He was being held. Terrified he pleaded:


I don't want to cry

He cried but not for long...

Mortally wounded, Stuttering Sam fell from
A seventeenth story window. His final words were:


Bomp-a-bomp-bomp...
Dang-a-dang...

This was the end of Murder Incorporated
Called to Washington for official ceremonies
The Touchables were asked what dangerous assignment
They would like next

"We would like our own television show!"
