It's only been a week or two
But things have really changed
The more I stand here holding you
I can tell the feeling's not the same
Oh, no


I'm a stranger in your arm
And a stranger to your charms
Another guy has caught your eye
I feel just like a stranger in your arms
(Stranger in your arms)

The lips that I am kissing now
Are not the lips I knew
The words of love you whisper now
I can tell somehow they don't ring true
Oh, no



A stranger in your arms

The way you smile
The way you speak
Every little thing you do
Seems to say in every way
You've found somebody new

It don't feel right with you tonight
I don't know who's to blame
But maybe when I hold you tight
You'll forget and call me by his name
Uh huh



Well
