Well here you come again and you're lookin' so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I wanna put you in a song, oh oh oh
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy I'd just write it from my heart
'Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
'Cause you're already there anyway, yes you are

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I wanna put you in a song
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say
Hey ain't you the girl in that song

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I'm in love with this girl
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine
Every night I'd drive you home
If I could put you in a
Let me put you in a song
Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby
