Life is full of lots of up and downs,
And the distance feels further when you're headed for the ground,
And there's nothing more painful than to let you're feelings take you down,
It's so hard to know the way you feel inside,
When there's many thoughts and feelings that you hide,
But you might feel better if you let me walk with you by your side,

And when you need a shoulder to cry on,
When you need a friend to rely on,
When the whole world is gone,
You won't be alone, cause I'll be there,
I'll be your shoulder to cry on,
I'll be there,
I'll be a friend to rely on,
When the whole world is gone,
You won't be alone, cause I'll be there.

All of the times when everything is wrong
And you're feeling like there's no use going on
You can't give it up
I'll help you work it out and carry on

Side by side, with you till the end
I'll always be the one to firmly hold your hand
No matter what is said or done
Our love will always continue on

Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on
Everyone needs a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
You won't be alone cause I'll be there (ooh)
I'll be your shoulder to cry on
I'll be there (I'll be there)
I'll be your friends to rely on
When the whole world was gone
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be there (ooh)
You'll have my shoulder to cry on
I'll be there (I'll be there)
I'll be the one to rely one
And when the whole world is gone
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be there!

And when the whole world is gone
You'll always have my shoulder to cry on...
