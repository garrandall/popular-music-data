I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes
(Fricki fricki)
4 minutes eh

Come on
Breakdown
Come on


Come on
Madonna


Come on boy I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll


Well, don't waste time,
Give me a sign,
Tell me how you wanna roll


I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both


Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where this at
Are you ready to go? (Are you ready to go?)


Come on


If you want it
You've already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want

If you feel it
It must be real
Just say the word
And I'mma give you what you want


Time is waiting


We only got four minutes to save the world


No hesitating
Grab a boy


Go grab a girl


Time is waiting


We only got four minutes to save the world


No hesitating


We only got four minutes huh four minutes

So keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna


You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock


That's right
Keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna


You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention


And I know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good by the way that you move


The road to hell is paved with good intentions


But if I die tonight at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me how 'bout you?


If you want it
You've already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want

If you feel it
It must be real
Just say the word
And I'mma give you what you want


Time is waiting


We only got four minutes to save the world


No hesitating
Grab a boy


Go grab a girl


Time is waiting


We only got four minutes to save the world


No hesitating


We only got four minutes huh four minutes

So keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna


You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock


That's right
Keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna


You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock


Breakdown


Tick tock tick tock tick tock


Tick tock tick tock tick tock


I've only got four minutes to save the world
