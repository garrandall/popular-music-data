Think of how we made love almost anywhere
Haven't I taken you almost everywhere?
Think of all the things that, that we shared
Then imagine me not there, oh

Giving you more carrots than the rabbit
Got you living lavish
Anything I've got, you can have it
Baby I'll do magic
I'll do all I can to keep you satisfied
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby
Just in case, just in case
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case
Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Case, night, I don't make it
Case, night
Case, night, I don't make it
Case, night, I don't make it
Case, night, I don't make it
Case, night, I don't make it

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby
Just in case, just in case
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

There's something you need to know
Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case
You're my heart, you're my soul
Your heart makes me whole
