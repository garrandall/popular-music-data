In the beginning 
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling 
Smiling in the photo booth

But we got closer
Soon you were eating 
off my spoon

You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll fall in love 
Disturb the peace
Find your hands 
all over me 
And then you bite your lip 
Whisper and say
"We're going all the way"

Tonight
Take me to the other
side, sparks fly like the 
Fourth of July just
take me to the other 
side,I see that sexy 
look in your eyes

And I know we ain't
friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight kiss me 
like it's do or die 
And take me to 
the other side

This could be perfect 
But we won't know
unless we try
I know you're nervous, 
Yeah. So just sit back
and let me drive

Tonight we'll fall in love 
Disturb the peace
Find your hands 
all over me 
And then you bite your lip 
Whisper and say
"We're going all the way"

Tonight
Take me to the other
side, sparks fly like the 
Fourth of July just
take me to the other 
side, I see that sexy 
look in your eyes

And I know we ain't
friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight kiss me 
like it's do or die 
And take me to 
the other side

(Whoa)

Kiss me like it's do or die

Tonight we'll fall in
love disturb the peace
Let your love crash 
intro me and then you
bite your lip Whisper and say

"We're going all the way"

Tonight
Take me to the other
side, sparks fly like the 
Fourth of July just
take me to the other 
side, I see that sexy 
look in your eyes

And I know we ain't
friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure

So tonight kiss me 
like it's do or die 
And take me to 
the other side

(Whoa)

Kiss me like it's 
do or die and 
take me to the 
other side
