Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!
Oooh-Oooh!

 + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just passed
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)


Grease don't pop on the stove no more
Moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out? (WHAT THE FUCK?!)
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like Afro-Sheen
But they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man, Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pulled up so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome (Cadillac brome?)
Now don't it sound absurd?
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up, fat man herb

Sticky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)


It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow
That's my bud
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club
In the back door (NIGGA WHAT?!)
Act like I don't make clout
How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump, hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (They got that work?)
Don't it smell so good?
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin', they wish y'all would

Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip
Get rid of evidence, move that brick
Keep a D-Eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so? (SUCK A DICK!)
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Black El-Dorado, fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock, I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed (You got a nose bleed?)
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where we pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night, creep, creep
I'll see you later when we in them streets
