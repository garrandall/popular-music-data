There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room, my room

In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears
In my room, in my room, my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room, my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
