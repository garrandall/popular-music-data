(crying) 
ahhhh little baby bitch ass is crying again 
whats the matter 
feelin like you dont fit in anywhere 
(yeh) 
what about fittin that ass in with us 
the mighty Deezy Cizzarn? 
We`ll fuckin gladly take ya 
We take all shape, colours, sizes and genders 
We are the mighty, mystical, mythilogical, dark mother fuckin Carnival, Byaaatchh! 

I see your feeling alone again, you's a mother fucker 
Feeling like you dont belong, like you the only other? 
But some of us scrubs got it worse then you, 
No homies to call on, or crew to belong to, 
Some us said fuck all that bullshit and dropped outl; 
Some of us stood up to fight but got knocked out 
Some of us like to cuss and dont like ya format, 
We like the wicked shit we chose not to ignore that, 
Some of us be comin out of more then a broken home, 
Some of us be livin out of a cars and carry on 
Some of us see the Budget Suits as a real appartment and 
make you take off your shoes on the carpet 
Some of us are on parol and cant leave the state, 
And some are dead and gone my homie blaze can relate. 
And some cant afford a free phone call 
but some of us's equal us all, 
think about that. 

We Belong 
We Belong 
We Belong 
Our Carnival Is Here 
We Belong 
We Belong 
We Belong 
Find Us Everywhere 

Some of us own dope cars that fail to exist 
Some of us have profiles, nobody else fits 
and some aint got time for the monks in Tibet 
because my own kids are hungry and there looking at me for shit 
Some of us own drug paraphernalia material, and some of us have incurable 
sexual venereals and some of us have dreams of being a star 
and most wont make it that far, but its all good 
Some of us cant afford the coolest shoes 
Some us gives a fuck about popularity choose 
Some bitches tittie dance cause they babies are cryin, 
others say there dancing for college and you know that they lyin, 
Some us are in love with people who aint ours, 
Some us dont give up until there behind bars, 
and some us must of been born to take the fall. 
But some us's equal us all, and I`m with you
