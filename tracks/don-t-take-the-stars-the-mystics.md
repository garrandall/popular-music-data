The night we fell in love
Stars bright above
They've gone away
Now the sky is grey

Don't take the stars from the sky
Don't say that our love must die
Oh, I love you

You mean the world to me
You are my destiny
You are my angel love
Sent from heaven above

Don't take the stars from the sky
Don't say that our love must die
Oh, I love you

Give your love back to me
Set the heavens free
Our stars will shine
When you say that you'll be mine

What good is life to me
Without your love I'll be
Alone and oh so blue
Oh baby, how I want you

Don't take the stars from the sky
Don't say that our love must die
Oh, I love you

What good is life to me
Without your love I'll be
Alone and oh so blue
Oh baby, how I want you

Don't take the stars from the sky
Don't say that our love must die
