Uh Uh Listen


Ya'll know what this is


Let's Go
We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall
Just so we can be the first ones with em on
Returned to school by lunchtime, like "Nigga what now? "
And today we in the club like, "Nigga, what now? "
Ya better look down
Cause Uh
I know you see em


Say what?
I know you see em


Say what?
I know you see em


I paid
1000 for the jeans


I paid
200 for the shoes
And uh
Fuck a shirt, I'm a rock dez tatoos
You see my fitted mayne
I represent da crib
Cause even at the crib
I represent the crib


I
I pop my grill in


And I
Might let my chain hang


And I
Might wrap my wrist, dang


Go on derrty do the damn thang
I get em free


Say what
But I pay, and if I want I rock a different Yurr of J's E'rrday
A different style, different color is a must

CHORUS:

Man he den stepped on my Jay's
Stepped on my Jays

But they dont get no run
Like dem 13...7's...number 4's..and dem 1's

How that Levi lay on em
If you ain't got em when you see me
You definitly gon want them
If they new I gotta get them first old i just pop a box
Hook em with a shirt
AND DA MATCHING COLOR SOXS
I think the coldest was the Black on Black
11's with the Red bottom
Order the number 9's
You should of seem me when I got them
I was in my house 
Dancin in the mirror
Straight thinkin bout gettin out
And how Im bout to kill em
When you know You got a pair that ain't nobody got 
You can't hold dem back you gotta rock!!
Imma attic a Jordan fanatic lil Morris Blackman
And I know when there come
Another color errthing is happenin

A different style
A different color
Is a must
But Uh..
Its ALL GOOD till I get my 1st scuff

Stepped on my Jays
He den stepped on my Jay's
Dese just came out

I-I-I see you lil' Daddy you look sexy with them j's on
I pull up in the drop, step out with them thangs on
I got me the black and pink 11's with the gray matching with the skinny jeans off with the shades

Yeah, we be fresh every day
And if youre lookin for me lil daddy you can find me in the A

I Got the Retro 1's, then I bought the 2's and the 3's and the 4's..
I had to order these you can't find them in the stores
Called up my stylist like 'shawty, Send more...'
And If you would, please, Send em to me out on tour 
They'll be here any minute, man..
See, I got that that connect
That I can damn near get like anything
Pose on em, Then imma stroll on em..
I call my hook up at the store like put a hold on em...

We call em 'Space Jams'..
You in my Space, man
I'll Make you jump, man
I'll make you Jump, Jump, Jump Jumpman..
See on my weekends..
My Jay's play a part
Im rockin these to da club and these to the park
Im puttin these on now and these, here, tomorrow..
A spurr-off in my car
Just in case I catch a scarr..


Hell Naw ain tno way

Man he den stepped on my Jay's
Stepped on my Jays
He den stepped on my Jay's
Dese just came out
He den stepped on my Jay's
