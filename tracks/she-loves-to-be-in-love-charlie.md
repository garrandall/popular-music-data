Thomas

The postman came today
Another letter from the U.S.A
That makes it four this week
Just put it down with the rest of the heap
Ooh my friend, she sure has got it bad
Ooh my friend, you're the first big love she's had
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, she can make it alone
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, this thing is her own
Doesn't seem to matter at all
That you haven't written and you haven't called
She seems quite happy, so leave it that way
'Cause tell the truth you got nothing to say to her
Ooh my friend, she sure has got it bad
Ooh my friend, you're the first big love she's had
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, she can make it alone
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, this thing is her own
She loves the feeling that she gets from this make believe romance
She thinks she's found her one big love, she don't need no second chance
So don't you spoil her hopes and dreams
By telling her that she don't mean a thing to you
She writes she's counting the days
'Til you're back in the U.S.A
She hopes you're feeling fine
And she wants you to drop a few Lines to her
Ooh my friend, she sure has got it bad
Ooh my friend, you're the first big love she's had
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, she can make it alone
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there, this thing is her own
