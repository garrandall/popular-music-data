One has my name, the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, that's how my heartaches start
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I am true
One has my love, the other only me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free?
So I'll go on livin' my life just the same
While one has my heart, the other has my name
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I am true
One has my love, the other only me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free?
If I could live over, my life I would change
The one who has my heart would also have my name
