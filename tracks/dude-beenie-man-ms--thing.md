You want a proper fix, call me,
you want to get your kicks, call me
You want your G's fixed, call me,
mi have the remix, call me
From di odda day
It's like a play some bwoy a play
Mi hear di girls callin mi
hear di girls bawlin mi hear di girls cryin out
She seh Beenie...


I want a dude with the wickedest slam,
I need a one, two, three hour man
I want a dude who will tie me to the fan,
a thug that can handle his biz like a man
I want a dude with the wickedest slam,
I need a one, two, three hour man
I want a dude who will do me in his van,
a thug that can handle his biz like a man


Gal, if yuh love holla at mi one time (Hey!)
Holla at mi if yuh waan di wickedest wine
I know It's been awhile but baby neva mind
Cause tonight tonight mi a gi yuh di whole nine (Hey!)
Yo! satisfaction a every girl dream
Mi love fi put it on when dem wiggle and scream (Hey!)
Well, mi get a call from sexy Maxine
She left a message pon mi answering machine she seh Beenie...




She waan a man fi put har inna trance
A man who know fi tun har round and mek she belly dance
Rudebwoy lovin wid a little romance
She waan to get wild but she neva had a chance
When, she seh she neva had it so deep
So right now I'm di man she definetly wanna keep
Har ex bwoyfriend use to come and drop asleep
Dat's why when mi pager start beep she seh Beenie...

You heard what she preferred,
she waan a man weh mek she fly like a bird
She waan a real man she don't waan nuh nerd
She waan yuh gi har it good mark mi word
I'm not a perv but mi mek she serv,
she waan di rockula well until it curve
Har ex bwoyfriend ain't got di nerve
Have har a wait and she nah get served,
so she seh Beenie...
