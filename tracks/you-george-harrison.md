I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you


But it's going to take money
A whole lot of spending money
It's going to take plenty of money
To do it right, child
It's going to take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's going to take patience and time
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right, child


I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you


And this time I know it's for real
The feeling that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it


I got my mind set on you
Set on you
I got my mind set on you
Set on you


But it's going to take money
A whole lot of spending money
It's going to take plenty of money
To do it right, child
It's going to take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's going to take patience and time
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right


I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you


And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it


But it's going to take money
A whole lot of spending money
It's going to take plenty of money
To do it right, child
It's going to take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's going to take patience and time
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you


I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you


Set on you
Set on you
Set on you Set on you
Set on you Set on you Set on you Set on you
