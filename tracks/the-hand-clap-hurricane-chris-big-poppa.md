Bang bang bang bang


Watch me jump right out of my J's
Soon I kick the can already the haters start to hate
All eyes on me cause I'm wearing that rubbaband chain
Ain't nobody up in here dancin but me how messed up is that mayne
They playin that "A Bay Bay" and nobody be clapping they
Hands mayne they hollin out make a circle for dollar boy
He bout to do the merry-go I told'em we don't superman nomore
I'm batman then supersoak that floor stop trippin and stop
Tryna hate I'll be wearing these rainbow's I got
Bapes, Yums and dem J's


Bang bang bang bang


Now watch me two step it out now watch
Me get jiggy with it and then walk it out (ayyye)
I'm doing my dougie (I'm fresh) know what I'm talkin bout?
Ain't nobody feelin like breakdancing all up on that
Floor I'm a do the pool palace then that shootout
(Yahhh Yahhh!) Ooooh! crankin that dance and if
It's that swing that rag I gots to have it put it in the air
Cause stunttin is a habit lil' jessie, lil' dollar we Stacks
On deck so all you haters don't hate and you gonna get knucked
Out if you step on my new J's


Bang bang bang bang


Now lean with it then drop it low like a 64
Lean with it then drop it low like a 64
Now lean with it then drop it low like a 64
Lean with it then drop it low like a 64
Bapes, Yums, J's don't get a mark on my
New shoes yo Bapes, Yums, J's don't get a
Mark on my new shoes yo I said
Bapes, Yums, J's don't get a mark on my
New shoes yo Bapes, Yums, J's don't get a
Mark on my new shoes yo or I'm a
Super soak all up this floor


Bang bang bang bang
