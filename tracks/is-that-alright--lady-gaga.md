Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Trying to figure out the world
It felt like summer
When I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story
But tell me again

Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

I want you to look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me, to be by my side
I want you at the end of my life
I wanna see your face, when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

I hope you're still with me when I'm not quite myself
And I pray that you'll lift me when you know I need help
It's a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story, of our fairy tale

Family dinners and family trees
Teaching the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

I want you to look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me, to be by my side
I want you at the end of my life
I wanna see your face, when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
