Is it really over
Is this the end of the line
Don't tell me I'm losing
The love that was mine

If you're really leaving
Take some part of me
So I'll always remember
How sweet love used to be

I wonder who's stepping into my shoes
Who can he be
I can tell by your eyes our love has died
And it's over for me

I wonder who's stepping into my shoes
Who can he be
I can tell by your eyes our love has died
And it's over for me

Really over for me...
