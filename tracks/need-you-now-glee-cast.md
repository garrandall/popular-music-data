Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore


And I wonder if I ever cross your mind


For me it happens all the time


It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control, and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now


Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before


And I wonder if I ever cross your mind


For me it happens all the time


It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control, and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now


Whoa


Whoa


Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all


It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone, and I need you now


And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk, and I need you now


And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now


Oh baby, I need you now
