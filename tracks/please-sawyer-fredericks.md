She's calling me, with a gentle touch
A love so real, it was far too much
For a boy like me, a worried mind
To believe in you, I gotta close my eyes

You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees
I can say please

The will was strong, but my legs were weak
I could not walk and I could not speak
The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth
You want me to say

You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees
I can say please

So I became a part of you
And you became a part of me
See I had no choice, but to lie to you, see
If I told you the truth, you'd have set me free
You'd have set me free

You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down onto my knees

I can say please
Baby I can say please
I can say please
