Derulo


It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys? 'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab (ooh)
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast (ooh)
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad (ooh)
Oh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high


Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Aw yeah


You open the door (ooh)
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor (ooh)
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby, I'm yours" (ooh)
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high


Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high
Ooh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high


Girl, you're the one I want to want me (I want you)
And if you want me, girl, you got me (you got me)
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do) (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you (oh)
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me (you got me)
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do) (wouldn't)
Just to get up next to you (oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I would do anything, just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Anything and everything, just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby, just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, get up, get up
