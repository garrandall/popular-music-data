You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I used to be your boyfriend
There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
And why should we ruin the purity of the moment
It's a Laugh
What a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is that everyone thought we were special
Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me
You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I have been here always
I am here forever
