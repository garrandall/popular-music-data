Just got off from work
It was awful late
I had to pass the cemetery gate
The sky was dark

And the moon was bright
It was a very, very cold, cold night
I never thought I could see such a sight
A poor soul doing the Dead Man's Stroll

Dressed in a top hat, cane and all
Must have been going to a dead man's ball
May not believe it but it has to be told
A poor soul doing the Dead Man's Stroll

Nodded his head
With a finger he led
I wasn't sure there was nothing to dread
We went on for miles and miles

Just before I realized
The time had passed when I was cold
I was now doing
The Dead Man's Stroll
