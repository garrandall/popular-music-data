More and more
Your kiss is like a half opened door
I can't get in
You stop me just before I begin
And it hurts to be in love
When you never get enough
Oh it hurts to be in love

This endless urge
Keeps my body right on the verge
We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again

And it hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
I tell you it hurts to be in love

I'm always worried you think I'm pushing too hard
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me I'm going to far

We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again
And it hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
I tell you it hurts to be in love
It hurts
Baby it hurts
It hurts
