You're my food, you're my water
You've got to be the devil's daughter
Can't get near, can't get far
You've got the power, but know you are


She's radioactive (Radioactive)
She's very selective (Radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
She wants it all the time


And I'm crazy, kinda hazy
I'm not sorry, gonna worry
I'm not lonely, she's my only
She's got me eatin' out of her hands


She's radioactive (Radioactive)
She's very selective (Radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
I've gotta make her mine


She's radioactive (Radioactive)
She's very selective (Radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
I've gotta make her mine


She's radioactive (Radioactive)
She's very selective (Radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
I've gotta make her mine


She's my little baby (Radioactive)
She's such a lady (Radioactive)
She knows how I feel
She knows that it's real
She wants it all the time


She's radioactive (Radioactive)
She's very selective (Radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
I've gotta make her mine


She's my little baby (Radioactive)
She's such a lady (Radioactive)
She knows how I feel
She knows that it's real
She wants it all the time
