I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
But people let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll

I thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it Lord it takes me home

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to those country songs
While I was in the back room rockin' on

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
