(Verse 1)
Callin' my river to let her know
I'mma be on my way
Missin' how the river flow even though
It's only been a couple of days

Because it be raining ain't complaining but...
You got that water made for drinking up
Baby if I drown tonight its all worth it for you
I don't need no rescue

(Chorus)
I'mma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go Under, Under
I ain't coming up until you screaming "I give up"
When I go Under, Under

You be making waves, my ships here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in all day
I want you to shake it, later tell me it was great
When I go under, under

(Verse 2)
Girl relax, captain can handle that
I'm gonna take this cruise real slow
Heading to paradise, close your eyes
All you gotta do is let it go

The way your body flow, it's a private show
And I can't stop until it's spilling over
It's a sight to see you and it's calling me
Telling me your body's getting closer

(Chorus)
I'm gonna hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go under, under
I ain't coming up until you screaming I give up
When I go under, under

You be making waves, my ship's here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
I want you to shake it, later tell me it was great
When I go under, under

(Bridge)
I'm jumping in, no lifesaver
Don't know when I'm coming up
Deep sea diving in your treasure
I'm giving you all this pleasure

Ooh girl, I'm so into you
So deep I don't know what to do
Just let the water flow
Till the tidal wave washes us ashore

(Chorus)

Under, under
Under, under
