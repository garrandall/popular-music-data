Oh Julie, if you love me truly
Do you want me, Julie?
To be, to be your very own
Julie, won't you hold me
Julie, don't be lonely
'Cause I want you only
To be, to be my very own
Baby, don't leave me
Honey, don't grieve me

Julie, why leave me alone
Stay with me, baby
Play with me,baby
Honey, don't leave me alone
Julie, never leave me
Please don't deceive me
Julie, oh believe me
And be, and be my very own

Oh Julie, if you love me truly
Do you want me, Julie?
To be, to be your very own
Baby, don't leave me
Honey, don't grieve me

Julie, why leave me alone
Stay with me, baby
Play with me, baby
Honey, don't leave me alone
Julie, never leave me
Please don't deceive me
Julie, oh believe me
And be, and be my very own

To be, to be, to be
To be, my very own
To be, to be, to be
To be my very own
