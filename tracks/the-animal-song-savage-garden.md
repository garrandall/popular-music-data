When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head 
A television freak show cops and robbers everywhere 
Subway makes me nervous, people pushing me too far 
I've got to break away 
So take my hand now


'Cause I want to live like animals 
Careless and free like animals 
I want to live 
I want to run through the jungle 
The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet 

I've been having difficulties keeping to myself 
Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf 
Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie 
Which one is more human 
There's a thought, now you decide 

Compassion in the jungle 
Compassion in your hands, yeah 
Would you like to make a run for it 
Would you like to take my hand, yeah 



Sometimes this life can get you down 
It's so confusing 
There's so many rules to follow 
And I feel it 
'Cause I just run away in my mind 

Superstars and cannonballs running through your head 
Television freak show cops and robbers everywhere 
Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie 
Which one is more human 
There's a thought, now you decide 

Compassion in the jungle 
Compassion in your hands, yeah 
Would you like to make a run for it 
Would you like to take my hand, yeah
