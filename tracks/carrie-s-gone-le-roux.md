You didn't know it would happen this way
You didn't realize she wouldn't stay
And now that she's breaking your heart
It's tearin' you apart

You should have noticed
Right from the start
You should have understood
She was too smart
And now that she's walking away
What do you have to say

It's so amazing to me
How blind some people can be
Who close their eyes
Complaining they can't see

Carrie's gone
She doesn't need you
She's where she belongs
Carrie's gone
She's here with me
Carrie's gone
She doesn't want you
She knows where she belongs
Carrie's gone
She's here with me

I could have told you
You were wasting your time
I could have let you know
You were way out of line
And now that you've taken the fall
Was it worth it all

You can't take back all the things
That you said
You can't take back the hurt
You put in her head
And now that she's figured you out
Nothing to talk about
