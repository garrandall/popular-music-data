(Woo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Oooooh-ah
Heaven)

"Going up?", she said, "Uh huh"
Just as we had started to climb
Together (Hoo, hoo)

Looking up, I said
"Hey, look, umm, maybe I could see you tonight?"
And she said, (Never) "Never"

Thought I was out of luck
But ten seconds later
Somehow we got stuck in that elevator, woo!

Heaven on the 7th floor (Ha ha ha ha ha)
Heaven on the 7th floor (I wanna tell you)
I've never been so high before
So don't you rescue me
Never set me free
(Hey, hey, hey)

We're alone, I said, oh yeah
"It looks like we could be here all night"
Together (Hoo, hoo)

"There's a phone", she said, "Uh-uh
You'd better have us out in five minutes time"
Whatever

"Please, could you make it ten?"
I told the operator
I'm having so much fun in this elevator

Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor (I'm up in heaven and I)
I've never been so high before
So don't you rescue me
Never set me free
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm in heaven

(I'm in heaven
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Heaven
Hoo, hoo, hoo)

And as the Muzak played (Sweet Muzak)
Sooner or later
I knew we'd fall in love in the elevator (Knew we'd fall in love in)

Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
I've never been so high before
So don't you rescue me
Never set me free
(Hey, hey, hey)
(He's in heaven, I'm in heaven)

Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
Heaven on the 7th floor
