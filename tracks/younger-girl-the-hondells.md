She's one of those girls who
Seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes
And you'll forget everything
You had ready to say
And I saw her today yeah

A younger girl keeps
Rolling 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try I can't seem to leave
Her memory behind I remember her eyes
Soft dark and brown
Said she'd never been
In trouble or even in town
A younger girl keeps
Rolling 'cross my mind

A younger girl keeps
Rolling 'cross my mind
And should I hang around
Acting like her brother
In a few more years
They'd call us right for each other
But why if I wait I'll just die yeah

She's one of those girls who
Seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes
And you'll forget everything
She's one of those girls who
Seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes
And you'll forget everything
