Only three stops to make in Alabama
Everyone a one night stand
Workin' for a man down South Louisiana
'Cause ZZ ain't his only band
Business has been good or bad
But sittin here will drive me mad


And I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man

Met a stray woman I think it was in Texas
She was made for those who'd pay
Gotta little drunk and raised a mild ruckus
The city said I could not stay
I guess I'm gonna have to change until this mess is rearranged



I guess I'm gonna have to change until my life is rearranged
