Take it away
Want to hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay till there's no one else around

Take it away
Want to hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay till there's no one else around


Lonely driver
Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go

Sole survivor
Carrying the load
Switches on his radio


Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down

Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
Mmm

Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around


In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(in his hand, in his hand)

Some important
Impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!


Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
(Down, down)

Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around


You never know who
May be listening to you

(Never know who
May be listening to you
You never know who
May be listening to you)

Take it away
Take it away


After hours
Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat

Faded flowers
Wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete


(Hah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)



(Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)
