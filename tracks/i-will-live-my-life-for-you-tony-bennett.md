Iâve got just about everything that I need
To make this life that I lead an enjoyable thing
Iâve got bluebirds and posies and robins and rosies
All kinds of flowers that bloom
All kinds of birds that sing

Iâve got just about everything that I want
To make this Earth that I walk a miraculous place
Iâve got fresh air and sunshine and mountains and may wine
And what is really a boon: I love the human race

When I say just about, just about, just about everything
I mean I must admit: one thing is really missing
Well, Iâm not complaining
With or without it I still got what I got
But you could better my life with some of your hugginâ and kissinâ
Thatâs what Iâm missinâ

Just say those words that I long to hear you say
And then my life will be complete and full to the top
And Iâll share all my treasures, my riches and pleasures
Makin the two of us one
Thatâs all that need be done

Say youâll be my own, my one and only one
Then I can say Iâve got everything I need

Iâve got just about everything that it takes
To set the scene and make it a marvelous bit
Iâve got barrels of laughter and hope ever after
And though I donât like to boast, shucks baby Iâve got âitâ

Iâve got just about everything that there is
To make this herâs and his a terrific affair
Iâve got dewdrops and oceans and all kinds of notions
And since I dig you the most Iâve got the urge to share

Thought Iâve got just about, just about, just about everything
I know for sure by now I really need whatâs lacking
No doubt about it, living without it I might turn out a slob
At best remain just a blob
So darling wonât you supply it? Come on, letâs try it

I could go on just as I am year after year
Yet with that one thing more I know Iâll reach the divine
Thatâs to have you and hold you and now that Iâve told you
Please make a positive sign
Saying that youâll be mine
And weâll have everything
Oh, how my heart will sing
Then I can say Iâve got everything I need
