Hey I'm a lucky guy
I got her by my side
Sunday afternoon
I'll take her for a ride
Downtown all around town
Where everyone can see
This pretty thing
She belongs to me

She's my baby
She's driving me crazy
She's got something I want you to see
Come on and show me
Show me a woman with a heart on fire
Oh show me
Show me a woman with a burning desire
You gotta show me
Show me a woman of the world
Oh and I'll show you my girl

I never knew how happy I could be
I'm digging her and the woman's digging me
Oh what a day
Got loving on my mind
Later on tonight
She'll let me know that I'm her baby

She's driving me crazy
She's got something I want you to see
Come on and show me
Show me a woman with a heart on fire
Please show me
Show me a woman with a burning desire
You gotta show me
Show me a woman of the world
Oh and I'll show you my girl
I'll show you my girl

(I'm so crazy)
Now some folks say I'm crazy about the lady
And I may be
Everybody is trying to clue me
She's a floozy and she'll use me
(You'd be crazy)
You'd be crazy about her kissing
If you knew of the loving you're missing
When I'm holding her tight
Yeah, I'm crazy all right
And there's nothing I'd rather be

She's my baby
She's driving me crazy
She's got something I want you to see
Come on and show me
Show me a woman with a heart on fire
Oh show me
Show me a woman with a burning desire
You gotta show me
Show me a woman of the world
Oh and I'll show you my girl
