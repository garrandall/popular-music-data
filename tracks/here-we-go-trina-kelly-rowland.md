I ain't got nothin ta say to you
I can't even believe you
You know what
Im too fly for this shit
You playin yourself

Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
(I can't take this no more)
No No No

Here we go
Here we go again
Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
I ain't tryna hear it
(Not this time)


Look nigga
What u think this is?
You treat me like a random chick
You done forgot who introduced you to rocks
And poppin all that cris an shit
Who let ya hit it from tha back
Anyway that you like
And any debts I can pay tha price
I thought I was a chick you would make your wife
And now a bitch can't even stay the night (You wack)
I can't even look in ya face
Witout wantin ta slap you
Damn I thank God I ain't get that tattoo
You better thank God I ain't have tha strap boo
You ain't even worth that trick get at you
Matta fact
Trick get at dude
I'm convinced
Ain't got shit ta ask you
And tell tha triflinâ€™ bitch
She can have you
I ain't lookin at you no more
Im lookin past you


Here we go
Here we go again
Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
(I can't take this no more)
No No No

Here we go
Here we go again
Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
I ain't tryna hear it
(Not this time)


When ma girl came through wit tha news
All I did was think about me and you like damn (Damn)
What a chick gotta do to get wit a real nigga
That know how to stay true like man (Man)
No more quarter to eights
You betta hop on a bus or a cab
I shed so many tears
Can't believe how many years
Tha baddest bitch put up witch yo dusty ass (Yeah)
Now you know that im tha queen of Miami (Uh huh)
All that loud talkin, lying
Save that shit for ya mami (Ha..Ha)
Sounds like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (talk too much)
Im like uh huh, okay, wassup, shut up


Here we go
Here we go again
Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
(I can't take this no more)
No No No

Here we go
Here we go again
Now you tellin me
That she is just a friend
Then why she callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
I ain't tryna hear it
(Not this time)


Now all my ladies say (Ohh Ohh)
If you feel me say (Ohh Ohh )
If you can't take no more say
No no no (no no no)
No no no (Ohh)


Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go again (Go again)
Now you tellin me (Yeah yeah)
That she is just a friend (Say shes just a friend)
And why shes callin you
At 3 o'clock in tha mornin
(I can't take this no more)


Thats why im packin up my jewels
Grabbin up my furs
Ill be back for all my shoes and purses
Watch me bounce
In my seven fourty five
Ill be ridin out
Cause I ain't tryna hear it
Not this time
