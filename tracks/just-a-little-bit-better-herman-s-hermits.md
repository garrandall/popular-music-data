He may send you flowers, baby, every single day
Buy you fancy clothes from Paris
And have sweet things to say
But I can give you love, sweet sweet love
Now ain't that just a little bit better?
Uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho

He'll take you to nightclubs in a shiny limousine
Buy you furs and diamond bracelets
Make you look just like a queen
But I can give you love, sweet sweet love
Now ain't that just a little bit better?
Uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho

Love, love, love is what I could give ya
True, true love as long as I may live

But I can give you love, sweet sweet love
Now ain't that just a little bit better?
Uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho

Love, love, love is what I could give ya
True, true love as long as I may live

Well, he may want to buy a fancy mansion on a hill
Will you live with him forever?
Baby, that ain't such a thrill
'Cause I can give you love, sweet sweet love
Now ain't that just a little bit better?
Uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho, uh-ho-ho
