Baby I'm sorry
Can't you find a way to somehow forgive me
I never meant to touch you


Somebody take my hand off
Cause I never meant to hit you, babe
I know I don't deserve another chance
But I had to say it anyway


I can't sleep
I can't think
I can't eat
I'm so weak
And I won't breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
It was such a silly move I made
On the only one who truly loves me
Took advantage of the love you gave
And turned around the truth
Now look at me
I can't sleep
I can't think
I can't eat
I'm so weak
And I can't breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na


Now I'm the nigga that you read about
In those freaky magazines
Sometimes I can't believe my ears
And what they say about me
Who gives a fuck about what they think
Is what my OG used to say
You just keep on doing your own thing boy
And sing your praises up that way


And you'll sleep
And you'll think
And you'll eat
Won't be weak
And you will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You will breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You'll breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
You'll breathe
You'll sleep
You'll think
Whoo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
