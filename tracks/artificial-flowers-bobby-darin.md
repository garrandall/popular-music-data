Alone in the world
Was poor little Anne
As sweet a young child as you'd find

Her parents had gone
To their final reward
Leaving their baby behind

Did ya hear?

This ... poor little child
Was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away

Still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew
To earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers
Artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear

She made artificial flowers
Ya know ... those artificial flowers
Fashioned from Annie's despair

With paper and shears
With some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum

As snowflakes drifted
Into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From making artificial flowers
Those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear

She made artificial flowers
Artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie
All covered with ice
Still clutching her poor frozen shears

Amidst all the blossoms
She had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven
Where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers

And instead of a halo
She'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

No more artificial flowers
Throw away those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of society to wear

Throw away those artificial flowers
Those dumb-dumb flowers ...
Fashioned from Annie's ...

Fashioned from Annie's despair

Give her the real thing!
