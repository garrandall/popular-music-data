Alone in the world was poor little Anne 
As sweet a young child as you'd find 
Her parents had gone to their final reward 
Leaving their baby behind 

Did you hear this poor little child 
Was only nine years of age 
When mother and dad went away 
Still she bravely worked 
At the one thing she knew 
To earn a few pennies a day 

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Fashioned from Annie's despair 

With papers and shears, with wire and wax 
She made up each tulip and mum 
As snow flakes drifted in to her tenement room 
Her baby little fingers grew numb 

From artificial flowers, those artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Made from Annie's despair 

And they found little Annie all covered with ice 
Still clutching her poor frozen shears 
Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand 
And watered with all her young tears 

There must be a Heaven where little Annie can play 
In heavenly gardens and bowers 
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head 
A garland of genuine flowers 

No more artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of society to wear 
Those artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Fashioned from Annie's 
Fashioned from Annie's despair
