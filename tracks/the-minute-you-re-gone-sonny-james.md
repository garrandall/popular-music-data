The minute you're gone I cry the minute you're gone I die
Before you walk out of sight I'm like a child all alone at night
I stare into emptiness I'm filled with such loneliness
The world goes from right to wrong the minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see oh how lonely a man I'll be
My life would be oh so blue if I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone
(The minute you're gone I see) oh how lonely a man I'll be
(My life would be oh so blue) if I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone (gone) gone
