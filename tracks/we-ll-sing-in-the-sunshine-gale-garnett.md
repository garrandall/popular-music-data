We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll stay with you one year

And we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin' don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight

But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

My daddy he once told me
"Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they may give you
And give but what you can."

And you can sing in the sunshine
You'll laugh everyday
You'll sing in the sunshine
Then be on your way

And when a year has ended
And I have gone away
You'll often speak about me
And this is what you'll say:

We sang in the sunshine
You know we laughed everyday
We sang in the sunshine
Then she went on her way
