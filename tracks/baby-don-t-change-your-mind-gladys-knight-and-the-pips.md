Oh your ex is back in town
Whatcha gonna do when she comes around
And she starts going through her act
When she begs you to take her back
Will your love for me remain intact
Or will you run to her

Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Don't change it

Oh you say your love is true
Whatcha gonna say when she looks at you
Will the second thoughts in your head
Make you take back the things you said
Will you give in and be misled
Or will you stay with me
(Stay with me)

Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Don't change it

(Do do do do dododododo)
(Do do do do dododododo)

I would exit and take my bow
But I don't want to lose you now
So I'm praying someway somehow
Baby you'll stay with me
(Stay with me)

Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it

You know she's not the staying kind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
You know my love is genuine
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
