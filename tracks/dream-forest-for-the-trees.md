I'm the first person
You're the second person
Earlier today I was in the third person
I'm the first person
You're the second person
Earlier today I was in the third person
Stop cursing, start diversing
Oedipus is bliss
The sunshine'll affect your mind
Expand your thoughts, Stretch it out
Don't doubt the amount
My brain is caught
I'm jazz blessed
Trip hoppin' so I flow like a stream
It's just a dream

We are all here in the act of creation
Let's fly away on our imagination
You take me to the highest heights
And into the depths of the deepest abyss

When I am dreaming, I don't know if
I'm truly asleep or if I'm awake
When I get up, I don't know if I'm
Truly awake or if I'm still dreaming

Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream...
Life is but a dream
Traveling the waves of an infinite ocean
I feel the deepest emotion
I see a shadow of reality
Please hold me closely and take me away

When I am dreaming, I don't know if
I'm truly asleep or if I'm awake
When I get up, I don't know if I'm
Truly awake or if I'm still dreaming

I'm the first person
You're the second person
Earlier today I was in the third person
Stop cursing, start diversing
Oedipus is bliss
The sunshine'll affect your mind
Expand your thoughts, Stretch it out
Don't doubt the amount
My brain is caught
I'm jazz blessed
Trip hoppin' so I flow like a stream
It's just a dream

When I am dreaming, I don't know if
I'm truly asleep or if I'm awake
When I get up, I don't know if I'm
Truly awake or if I'm still dreaming

When I get up, I don't know if I'm
Truly awake or if I'm still dreaming
