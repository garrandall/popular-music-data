I worked all week.
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved.
I got the cover off the '68.
I fire it up and let them horses sing.
A little pretty thing.
A little tan-legged Georgia dream.
Sheâs a rockinâ them holey jeans.
Baby what you got goinâ on Saturday?
You know words got it thereâs gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires.
Muscadine wine


Oh baby you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittinâ âround watchinâ all these pretty things.
Get down in that Georgia clay.
And Iâll find peace.
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
I'm chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
Itâs my kinda party.


If you wanna drink,
Go baby just do your thing.
Give up your keys.
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while weâll sneak away from the bonfire.
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside.
Gotcha sippin' on some moonshine.
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo,
You can be my tan-legged Juliet,
Iâll be your Redneck Romeo.



Ya'll ready for this?
Ya'll gonna turn it on up.
