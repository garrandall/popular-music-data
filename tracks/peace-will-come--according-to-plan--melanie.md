There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one

For sometimes when I am feeling as big as the land
With the velvet hill in the small of my back
And my hands are playing the sand

And my feet are swimming in all of the waters
All of the rivers are givers to the ocean
According to plan, according to man

Well sometimes when I am feeling so grand
And I become the world
And the world becomes a man

And my song becomes a part of the river
I cry out to keep me just the way I am
According to plan

According to man, according to plan
According to man, according to plan

Oh there's a chance peace will come
In your life, please buy one
Oh there's a chance peace will come
In your life, please buy one

For sometimes when we have reached the end
With the velvet hill in the small of my backs
And our hands are clutching the sand

Will our blood become a part of the river
All of the rivers are givers to the ocean
According to plan, according to man

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
For sometime when we have reached the end
With the velvet hill in the small of my backs
And our hands are clutching the sand

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one...
