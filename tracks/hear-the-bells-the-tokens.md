Hear the bells are calling
From the village just a mile away
My true love is waiting
In the village just a mile away

Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away

Hear the bells ringing in the village
And they seem to say
I'll soon be with my true love
In the village just a mile away

Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away

Hear the bells are ringing
In the village just a mile away
I'll soon be with my true love
In the village just a mile away

Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away
Run, run de run away.
