Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back, oh
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back

Don't even know what we're fighting for
But, damn, I need a minute, so baby keep your distance
Heard it all, so Imma just go
Don't bother waiting up, I just need some time alone

Damn, where the hell are my keys
I just wanna leave,
Get in my car, and Imma just drive,
All night
Turn off my phone, radio on, and drive
So I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I canât even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Hey baby, I'm back and I've calmed down
I've done with all the cussin'
I came to give a little something
You got me screaming for a different reason now
While we're breaking stuff, tearing it up
Neighbors hear you loving me down, all night

(damn) where the hell are my clothes, I don't wanna go
But it's getting late, so Imma just drive all night
Moving real slow, radio low, just drive
So I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I canât even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Who I think I'm fooling anyway
Driving around the block just to come right back to you
When all along, I knew I should have stayed right where I was in steady love
Instead I drive and think of you

So I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I canât even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Oh oh
(Oh oh)
Oh oh
(Oh)
Imma turn right back babe ,imma come right back to you
Oh
Imma turn right back babe, imma come right back to you
