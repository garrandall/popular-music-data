Though your hair is all in tangles
And your makeup is a mess
Most of what you're drinking
Is spilling down your dress

And to keep from falling off
Your barstool's 'bout
All that you can do
I'll make my proposition
'Cause I'm just as drunk as you


Let's do something cheap and superficial
Let's do something that we might regret
Let's do something shabby and insensitive
This might be the only chance we get

You got lipstick showing on your teeth
And a run down your hose
Where you got that cheap perfume
God only knows

Now I'll be glad to have you home
Long before daylight
The sun is your worst enemy
Thank God it's dark tonight



This might be the only chance we get
