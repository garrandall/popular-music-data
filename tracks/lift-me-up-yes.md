Look around, got no place to stay
God I hate this town, depending on the day
You help me up, you help me down, alright, OK

While I got no life, I got no hope
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight
Help me with tonight, I'm calling

What to do I find it hard to know
Lord, the walk is not the one I chose

Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm

Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries

Open doors, they may be closed to me
The fire's still burning in my heart

While I got no life, I got no hope
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight
Help me with tonight, I'm calling

What to do I find it hard to know
I want to turn my life around

Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm

Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries

Open doors, they may be closed to me
The fire's still burning in my heart

Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm

Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm

Trevor Rabin!
