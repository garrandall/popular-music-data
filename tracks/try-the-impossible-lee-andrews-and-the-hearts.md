Try the impossible
Try to understand the way I feel about you
Try the incredible
For then trying all of my dreams
Might come true
Try to understand
You're everything I ever hoped for


And if you try to make it, survive
Take my heart, it will be yours
I really mean it
When I tell you I'll be at your beckon call
Tell me you love me
And our love will conquer all


The need for you, just to be with you
Is the reason to why I'm meeting you


Make the impossible, the incredible
And all my dreams come true


I really mean it
When I tell you I'll be at your beckon call
Tell me you want me
And our love will conquer all
All the need for you, just to be with you
Is the reason of why
I plead to you


Make the impossible, the incredible
And all of my dreams come true


Try the impossible
