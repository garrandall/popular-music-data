Gonna catch a freight train as far as I can Lord
I don't care which way it goes
Gonna climb a mountain, the highest mountain Lord
Jump off ain't nobody gonna know


Can't you see, oh can't you see
What that woman's been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman's been doin' to me?


Gonna buy a ticket go as far as I can Lord
I ain't never coming back
Take me a southbound all the way down Lord
Till the train run out of track
