Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better, 'cause I'm over you
I've learned my lesson, it left a scar
And now I see how you really are

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

Broke her heart, was gentle and true
I left a girl for someone like you
I'll beg her forgiveness on bended knee
But I wouldn't blame her if she said to me

You're no good, it's no good, it's no good
Baby, it's no good
I'm gonna say it again
It's no good, it's no good, it's no good
Baby, it's no good
Mm, no good

If she'll have me, we'll start anew
It'll be easy forgetting you

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it out loud
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

Oh oh oh
I'm putting you down, baby, and I'm going away
Forget about you, baby, I'm a-leaving to stay
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
Hey hey hey
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
