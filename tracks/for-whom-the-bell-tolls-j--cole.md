I see the, I see the..
I see the, I see the..
I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, Lord..
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord, Lord..

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

I see the rain pouring down
