If I could catch a star before it touched the ground
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around
And then I'd offer it to you
A token of my love and deep devotion

The world's a better place
With you to turn to
I'm a better man
For having loved you

And now, at last, I face the future unafraid
With you here by my side, how fast the shadows fade
And there is hope inside my heart
'Cause I have something wonderful to live for

The world's a better place
With you to turn to
I'm a better man
For having loved you

And as I am today
That's how I'll always stay
A better man for having loved you
A better man for having loved you

The world's a better place
With you to turn to
I'm a better man
For having loved you

And as I am today
That's how I'll always stay
A better man for having loved you
A better man for having loved you

If I could catch a star before it touched the ground
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around
And then I'd offer it to you
A token of my love and deep devotion
