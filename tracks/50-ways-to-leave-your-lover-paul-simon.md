The problem is all inside your head
She said to me
The answer is easy if you
Take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle
To be free
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover

She said it's really not my habit
To intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning
Won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself
At the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

She said it grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again
And I said I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways

She said why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me
And I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just get yourself free
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free

C'mon
You just slip out the back, Jack
You make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy 
Ah
You just listen to me
You hop on the bus, Gus
There's no need to discuss much
You just drop off the key, Lee
Ah
And get yourself free
And you get yourself free
