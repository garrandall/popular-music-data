Oh, I tried to make the best of
All the sweet love that you gave me
Maybe I'm crazy
But I keep on losing ground

Fool that I am, fool that I may be
When will I ever know what's true
And if I found out differently
Would I still love you?

Two hearts breakin', two hearts achin'
Someone's takin' more than they gave
Trusting in someone
Who has no trust in me

Fool that I am, fool that I may be
When will I ever know what's true
And if I found out differently
Would I still love you?

Fool that I am, fool that I may be
When will I ever know what's true
And if I found out differently
Would I still love you?
Would I still love you?
