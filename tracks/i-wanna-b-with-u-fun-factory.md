I wanna b with you
I wanna b with you baby
Yeah baby

I wanna b with you 'cause my love is true
There's so many things that I wanna do
I wanna b with you every night and day
Oh baby oh baby please stay

What's up what's wrong?
Don't stop loving me
'cause my love is very deep
And I know what you need
What can I do to fulfill your dreams?
I wanna b with you
No matter what you do so come on
Give what I need
Hit hit I get straight with it
'cause when I see you girl
You know you make me go wicked
Back to the point and you know me be movin'
I wanna be with you 'cause
My heart is still groovin'

Girlie girlie tell me

So deep in love baby can't you see
I wanna hear
Some lovely words from you
Come baby come
Say I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
You wanna be with me girl well just come here
The love I got will be right here
I wanna make you weak in every way
'cause the love I give you walk this way
