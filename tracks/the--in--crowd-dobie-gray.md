I'm in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)
I go where the in crowd goes (Do-do-do)
I'm in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)
And I know what the in crowd knows (Da-da-da-da)

Any time of the year, don't you hear? (Havin' a ball)
Dressin' fine, makin' time
We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from the people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the in crowd is out of sight

I'm in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)
I know every latest dance (Do-do-do)
When you're in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)
It's easy to find romance (Get down)

At a spot where the beat's really hot (Where we are bound)
If it's square, we ain't there
We make every minute count, yeah
Our share is always the biggest amount
Other guys imitate us
But the original's still the greatest

Yeah, yeah

Got our own way of walkin'
We got our own way of talkin', yeah

(Gonna have fun)
Anytime of the year, don't you hear? (Gonna have fun)
Spendin' cash, talkin' trash
Girl, I'll show you a real good time
Come on with me and leave your troubles behind
I don't care where you've been
You ain't been nowhere till you've been in

With the in crowd, yeah
Oh, with the in crowd (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We got our own way of walkin', yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We got our own way of talkin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
In the in crowd
