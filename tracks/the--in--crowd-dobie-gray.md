I'm in with the in crowd
I go where the in crowd goes
I'm in with the in crowd
And I know what the in crowd knows

Any time of the year, don't you hear
Dressing fine, making time

We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from the people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the in crowd is out of sight

I'm in with the in crowd
I know the latest dance
When you're in the in crowd
It's so easy to find romance
Any time of the year, don't you hear
If it square, we ain't there
We make every minute count
Our share is always the biggest amount
Other guys imitate us
But the original is still the greatest

I'm in with the in crowd
I go where the in crowd goes
I'm in with the in crowd
And I know what the in crowd knows

Any time of the year, don't you hear
Dressing fine, making time

We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from the people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the in crowd is out of sight

I'm in the in crowd
I'm in the in crowd now
Not on the outside
Looking in

I'm in the in crowd
I'm in the in crowd, yeah yeah yeah
I'm in the in crowd

It feels nice, it feels nice
It feels nice, it feels nice
It feels nice, it feels nice
It feels nice, it feels nice
It feels
