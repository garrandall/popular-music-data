True stories, what
Miracles, what
True blessings, what
True stories, what
Miracles, what
True blessings, what

I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rolling on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I look on the floor
Felt on the backseat

See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking about what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now

The doctor said, "I don't think he's gonna make it."
Family said, "Make the funeral arrangements.
Unplug the machine. He's gone now."
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me,
"If you promise to stop drinking."
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years I've been straight

You saved me
You saved me
You saved me
You saved me
Thank you Jesus

Gave me a second chance
Oh no
You saved me
Thank you Jesus
You saved me
You saved me
You saved me

Now I've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God
That someone would call me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and got so mad at him
And when somebody said, "God's good,"
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said, "We're hiring,"
And that's when I knew

He saved me
You saved me
You saved me
He saved me
You saved me
Thank you Jesus

Gave me a second chance
You saved me
Oh no
You saved me
Oh no
You saved me
Thank you Jesus
You saved me

Now I was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
And family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside I was all alone

And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot four times
And before I knew it I was on my knees

Blood pushing out my body
My heart's beating faster
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't think I'm gonna last
Then I began to flash back on the things I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said to me,
"I'll give you peace if you believe."
I accepted Christ that day
Hallelujah now I'm free

You saved me
You saved me
You saved me
You saved me

Gave me a second chance
You saved me
And I wanna thank
You saved me
Thank you thank you
You saved me
You saved me

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from
I got tested and the results came back
And the doctor said, "I'm sorry but you got cancer."
Jesus
I could not believe it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) said, "Just keep on thanking Jesus:
(mama) he'll give you what you need."
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said, "You can go home
'Cause all your cancer's gone."

You saved me
Said you saved me
You saved me
You saved me
No no
You saved me
You saved me

Gave me a second chance
And I'm so glad
You saved me
I'm so glad
I'm so glad
You saved me
You saved me
Just when I was going left
You saved me

When I was going left
You just turned me right
Goes all the way down
And you lift me up all night

And though you saw my faults
You forgave me all my sins
And I would call on you
Then you just let me live

I had nothing to lose
You saw I tried, I choose
And now I'm
'Cause you are the truth

You saved me
You just saved me
You saved me
You saved me
You saved me
You saved me

Gave me a second chance
Oh no
You saved me
Hallelujah
You saved me
You saved me

You gave me
It was by grace that You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope
With nowhere to go
And you gave me the second chance

I was down and out too
Yes I was
I was doing drugs too
Yes I was
I was running the streets too
Never felt love 'til you saved me

I was gang-banging 'til you saved me
Wilding out 'til you saved me
On my dying bed 'til you stepped in

You saved me
