I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got
'Cause if I do, I would surely, surely loose a lot
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby

I'm not superstitious about you, but I can't take no chance
You got me spinning, baby, baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby

It's no secret, that woman is my loving cup
Well, she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her, you know it means so much

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby
I better knock, knock, knock

Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock
