Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ohoohha ha ha!)
Like you do do do do babe

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
