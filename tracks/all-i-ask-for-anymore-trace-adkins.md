It was a home run when the game was tied 
A pick up truck when I could drive 
One pink line when katie said I'm late 
It was a passing grade, a pretty girl 
All the money in the world 
What mattered then kept changing every day 

But when I bow my head tonight 
There'll be no me myself and I 
Just watch my wife and kids please lord 
That's all I ask for any more 

Now a days it's crazy how 
A passing storm, a siren sound 
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone 
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days 
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home 

And when I bow my head tonight 
There'll be no me myself and I 
Just watch my wife and kids please lord 
That's all I ask for any more 

Let 'em outlive me by a hundred years 
Let their laughter dry up all their tears 
Let 'em love and be loved back like I have been 

When I bow my head tonight 
There'll be no me myself and I 
Just watch my wife and kids please lord 
That's all I ask for any more 

That's all that matters anymore
