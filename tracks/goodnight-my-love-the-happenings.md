Goodnight my love
Bless your heart and sleep tight my love
Goodnight
Never thought that I'd
Ever want to be leaving you
You're the dearest girl I've known
And there's nothing that I own
That I wouldn't want to give to you
But late last night after we kissed goodnight
And I started home
I met a girl so sweet and caring
And so very alone
And then I gazed into her eyes
And knew how much she wanted me
And her lips were just as soft as could be
Goodnight my love
Bless your heart and sleep tight my love
Goodnight
No tears that I could cry
Would justify my hurting you
And my words would sound so cheap
If I said that I meant to keep
All the promises I made to you
I tried to tell her that I loved you
But she just didn't care
And in the dead of night she pulled the ribbon
Out of her hair
And there was nothing in the world
That could have made me let her go
Girl I'm sorry but I just love her so
Goodnight my love
Goodnight my love
Sleep tight my love
Goodnight my love
It's so hard to say goodbye to you
The words they don't sound right
So I'll say the only words I used to say
When I held you so tight
Goodnight my love
Goodnight my love
Sleep tight my love
Goodnight my love
