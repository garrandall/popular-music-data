You talk about gardens and talk about Prague
You talk about artistsâ imitations of life and love
You talk about the âgrander thingsâ and we talk about you
But I ask how you feel and you can;t even think it through

You talk about your brothers and future happenings
You ask me what I think and I just smile because theyâre only little things
You talk about of the color sqhems in the hotel rooms of dark and light
But I ask you could you live with me and you just kiss me goodnight

So, I wonât advertise that I love you 
And I wonât tell you how your smile light up the room 
You can just say that youâre impressed with my rhythm 
Or something like that
And I wonât ask anything again anytime soon

You talk about bondage while I stare at the moon
And you talk about poetâs sonnets and summarize their doom
You talk of scheme of things where everything goes
But I ask you I am for you and you smile and say, âWho knows?â

So, I wonât advertise that I love you
And I wonât tell you how your smile light up the room 
You can just say that youâre impressed with my rhythm 
Or something like that
And I wonât ask anything again anytime soon

So I wonât pour my heart out and break when you donât notice
And I won;t tell you how your loving sets me free
You can just stick to the technicalities
And Iâll just know that I write for me

I write for me
I write for me...
