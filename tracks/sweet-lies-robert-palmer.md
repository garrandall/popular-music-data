We tell sweet lies, fooling one another
(We gain a fake upper hand)
We get outsmarted when we rediscover
We underplay

You took me in â I never minded
You broke the rules â I saw through you then

What a surprise when we turn into lovers!
(The tables turn on us)
All those sweet lies tear away the covers
And now we know not to underestimate
What hearts can do
You keep an eye on me
I'll keep an eye on you

You took me in â I never minded
You broke the rules â I saw through you then

What a surprise when we turn into lovers!
(We never guessed it could be)
All those sweet lies tear away the covers
The tables turn
