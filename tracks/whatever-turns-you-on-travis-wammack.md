Hey comeon gather around children
Let's all have a good time
If you got a little dance you want to do
Do it get it off your mind
Don't just sit around and go on thinkin you don't belong
Go on do your thing child
Whatever turns you on

Whatever turns you on Do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
Whatever turns you on do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it

This house was made to have a good time
You can come here people
Get your troubles offf your mind
Doing just what you feel
Is the name of the game
Here you can be yourself
Without being ashamed

Whatever turns you on Do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
Whatever turns you on do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it

Skinny minny, just because you're skinny
Don't be ashamed of your hot pants
A lot of fellas are out there waitin on you child for the next dance
Big fat momma I know its crowded but you can still move around
If we have to clear this whole dance floor
We're going to let you do your breakdown

Whatever turns you on Do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
Whatever turns you on do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
Yeah baby

Hey you over there breakin
All ??
Let me see you back it up and do that cajun walk
Look there in the corner
This kid he doing a brand new thing
Now whatever turns you on baby
Do it
Now don't be ashamed

Whatever turns you on Do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
Whatever turns you on do it
Whatever you want to do Get to it
