Some people
They know how to play the game of love
Some people
Know just who to pray to up above

I know where I'm going
I`m taking it straight to the top
I know where I'm going
I don`t see a reason to stop

You took my hand
Put me back where I started
Showed me the way
Showed me the way
You took my hand
Put me back where I started

Some people
Seem to get the best of life really easy
Some people
Seemed to be put on this earth to please me

I know that I'm lucky
What you give me
I`ll send right back
I know I'm so lucky
This won`t be a tough one to crack

You took my hand
Put me back where I started
Showed me the way
Showed me the way
You took my hand
Put me back where I started

Some of us were living in perplexion
While others seemed to go sailing through
Some of us were getting no direction
Some of us could only think of you

Some people
Can give every piece of their heart to another
Some people
Are just as happy when they`re left on their own

I know what I have now
The grass isn't greener over there
I know what I have now
And it`s something that I want to share

You took my hand
Put me back where I started
Showed me the way
Showed me the way
You took my hand
Put me back where I started
