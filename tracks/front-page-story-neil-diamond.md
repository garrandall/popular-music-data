She wakes up
She's leaving
She sets out so assured
That she can find
The life that she believes in

She's glad now
It's over
She never should of gotten so involved
At least that's what she told him

And it' ain't a Front Page Story
Won't even make the papers
Somebody  breaks a heart in two
And it happens much too often
Won't ever make the headlines
Somebody's broken heart ain't new
Except when it happens to you

He wonders
What happened
He thinks of all the things
He might have done
Why shouldn't she believe him

He wakes up without her
And never really knows
Just what went wrong
But it's all wrong without her

And it ain't a Front Page Story
Won't even make the papers
Somebody breaks a heart in two
And it happens much too often
Won't ever make the headlines
Another broken heart ain't new
Except when it happens to you

It ain't a Front Page Story
Won't even make the papers
Somebody  breaks a heart in two
And it happens much too often
Won't ever make the headlines
Somebody's broken heart ain't new
Except when it happens to you
No no no

Won't make the headlines
Somebody breaks a heart in two

No no no
Oh no no

Somebody's broken heart ain't news
Except when it happens to you

No no no
Won't make the headlines
Somebody breaks a heart in two

No no no
Oh no no
Somebody's broken heart ain't news
