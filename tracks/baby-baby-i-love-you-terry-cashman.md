I'm a little insane
And I know that you see it
You take my pain and
You help me to free it
Oh, you show me how

So many fears
With no place to hide them
Hold me and soon
My tears will subside
Oh, I know it now

And when someone can
Make you feel that way
There's nothing left
For a man to say

Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you

Oceans between us
But we're not apart
You got a special
Place in my heart
It was meant to be

You made me wonder
You made me cry
You mostly made me myself
All the while, you said to me

And when someone can
Make you feel that way
There's nothing left
For a man to say

Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you

It's so simple, it's so true
Honey, I'm in love with you

And when someone
Can make you feel
When there's nothing left
To say, I will say

Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you

I love you, yes, I do
Oh, you know it's true
