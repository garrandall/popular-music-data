Oooh, what a good thing I've got
Oh, it's such a good thing I've got
I don't think I can stand it

Thunder and lightning, oh yeah!
I tell you it's frightening, oooh!
It's thunder and lightning
And you're in control

I thought my life was complete
But look what you're doin' to me
Oh, you're makin' me crazy

Thunder and lightning, oh yeah!
I tell you it's frightening, ooohooo!
It's thunder and lightning
And you're in control

I don't know how to handle it
It's more than I would dare
I wouldn't try to run from it
It reaches everywhere

I'm feelin' dizzy and weak
You make me forget how to speak
I can feel it happening

It's thunder and lightning, oh yeah!
I tell you it's frightening, ooohooo!
Thunder and lightning
And you're in control

Oh, thunder and lightning, ooohooo!
I tell you it's frightening, oh yeah!
I tell it's thunder and lightning, ooohooo!
I tell you it's frightening, oh yeah!

I tell you thunder and lightning, oh yeah!
Don't you know that it's frightning, oh yeah!
I know it's thunder and lightning
