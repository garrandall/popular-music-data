You look so fine, you move so hot
Each time you touch me, it's just the right spot
Can't stop this feeling, won't try to pretend
I'm a sucker for passion, don't want it to end

I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, you turn me inside out
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time we meet, you've got to

Love me
(Over and over)
Move me
(Over and over)
Thrill me
(Over and over)
I need more
Oh, touch me
(Over and over)
Tell me
(Over and over)
Hold me
(Over and over)
I need more of you

Make me feel good, make it real nice
Don't ever stop, I want you all night
You make me crazy, but what do I care?
I'm a sucker for passion, I want you right here

I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, my body starts to shake
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time you're near, you've got to

Love me
(Over and over)
Move me
(Over and over)
Thrill me
(Over and over)
I need more
Oh, touch me
(Over and over)
Tell me
(Over and over)
Hold me
(Over and over)
I need more of you

(Over and over)
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
I need more of you
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
I need more of you

The L.A. boys are truly wild
Miami posse's hot
The Texas boys are chili-most
The southern tip's the spot
Chicago's home's for all the real
The fellas whoop while I'm in their Rover
But New York, you are the most fierce
You make me over and over, yeah

I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, you turn me inside out
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time we meet, you've got to

Love me
(Over and over)
Move me
(Over and over)
Thrill me
(Over and over)
I need more
Oh, touch me
(Over and over)
Tell me
(Over and over)
Hold me
(Over and over)
I need more of you

(Over and over)
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
I need more of you
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
I need more of you

Love me
(Over and over)
Move me
(Over and over)
Oh, you thrill me, yeah
(Over and over)
I need more
Oh, touch me
(Over and over)
Tell me
(Over and over)
Hold me, baby
(Over and over)
I need more of you

(Over and over)
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
I need more of you
(Over and over)
(Over and over)
