Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear 
And he shows them pearly white 
Just a jack-knife has Mac-heath, dear 
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear 
Scarlet billows start to spread 
Fancy gloves though wears Mac-heath, dear 
So there's not a trace, not a trace of red 
On the sidewalk on a Sunday morning 
Lies a body oozing life 
Someone's sneaking 'round that corner
Tell me could it be, could it be Mack the Knife

On a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
A cement bag's dropping down 
The cement's just for the weight, dear 
Bet you that cat called Mack-heath, oh Mack-heath, he's back in town 



Oh Mack-heath's back in town
He's back, he's back, he's back, he's back
He's back, he's back, he's back, he's back, he's back, he's back in town
Mack-heath's back in town
