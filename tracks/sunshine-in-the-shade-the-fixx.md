Sunshine warming the small of my back
Whatever virtues I lack
You can't see until I move
Until I move in the shade
Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade

But then inside
Sometimes I feel so cold
Catching these self thrown blows
But enough of the future I see
A shadow belonging to me
Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade

Every man climbs a mountain
With the hope to make a stand
Every man makes a mountain of his life
A masterplan

Only hope
Light in the dark
Only hope
Light in the dark
Gives me hope

Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade
Sunshine in the shade
The shade of life
Gives me hope of
Some time and place
