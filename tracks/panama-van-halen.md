Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline
Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her

Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on ramp comin' through my bedroom
Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her

Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama

Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off of it
Ah, you reach down, between my legs and ease the seat back
She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind the rear view mirror now
Got the feeling, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now

Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama
Panama
