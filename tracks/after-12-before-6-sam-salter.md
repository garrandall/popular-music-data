I heard the phone ring, it's you
Telling me all I do is neglect you
The first thing that I wanna say
You know I've been working hard and all day, baby

I don't trip on what your friends say
'Cause you know they all want me anyway
You know that I'll be true to you
My love can't start until, oh love

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

And now it's 12 o'clock is here
I wanna please you and I'm being sincere
The rest of the night is yours and mine
We're gonna chill, relax and unwind, baby

I go to work tired each and every day
'Cause I spent the night before pleasing my babe
You know that I am true to you
But love can't start until, yeah, yeah

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

You will never be alone, no
'Cause I know, yeah, yeah
Just how to keep my baby satisfied

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long

After 12, after 12, after 12, babe
After 12, after 12, after 12, babe
After 12, after 12, after 12, babe
All night, all night long, yeah yeah yeah
