Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms: baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too.
Put your lips close to mine
Dear
Won't you kiss me once
Baby
Just a kiss good-night
Maybe you and I will fall in love.
People say that love's a game you just can't win.
If there's a way
I'll find it some day
And then this fool will rush in.
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me
Tell me that you love me too.
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear baby
Put your head on my shoulder
