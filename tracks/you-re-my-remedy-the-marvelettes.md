Don't give me no headache powders
They don't do no good for me
There is nothing I can take
When my head starts to ache
Cause you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
You can call my name
And soothe all my pain
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

When things look dark and dreary
And I'm as blue as I can be
The only thing to cheer me
Is to have you near me
Cause you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
When the going gets tough
And I've stood enough
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

Don't call a doctor
A nurse is worse
Cause a pill won't heal my pain
When I'm feeling blue
You know what to do
To make me feel alright again

Sometimes I get to trembling and shaking
Like a leaf shaking on a tree
It's just as I suspect
I'll be a nervous wreck
But you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh, how you soothe me
I need you around
To calm me down
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

You're my remedy
You're my remedy
You're my remedy
All I really need

You're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
You can call my name
And soothe all my pain
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

One more time
You're my remedy
When the going gets tough
And I've stood enough
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy
