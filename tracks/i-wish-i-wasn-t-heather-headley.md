I'm home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know it's not quite that way
It's getting pretty late
And you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish, that you were home
Holding me tight in your arms
I wish, I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

When you touch me my heart melts
And everything you did wrong I forget
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment
And it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish, that you were home
Holding me tight in your arms (Oh baby)
I wish, I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

Said you care about me
But from what I see
I ain't feeling all that
So I disagree
Gave you all my love
And understanding

Yet you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone
Don't want nothin' from you
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no, no, no more

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change

I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

Hear you knockin' at the door again
I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me
So beautiful in your hand
Please stop begging me to take you back
I've always been a sucker for romance
And before you know it I concede
You're all over me
Oh no here I go again
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
