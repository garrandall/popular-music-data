I will hear you say
Goodbye, my love
And you'll be on your way

Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown, oh
I'll be all alone
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

When your restless eyes
Meet someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise

Then the blue shadows
Will fall all over town, oh
Love will let me down
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Oh, my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown, oh
I'll be all alone

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you go forever

I'll be holding on
For dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow

Then the blue shadows
Will fall all over town, oh
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around

Don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
