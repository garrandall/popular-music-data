And now the pain begins
The teardrops start
And now the rain begins
Within my heart

But that's the price I pay
The price a fool must pay
For I let true love slip away

And now the blues walk in
And sleepless nights
No gypsy violins
No starry flights

Just broken dreams for me
Of fading memories
And now to love that once was mine
Goodbye

Just broken dreams for me
Of fading memories
And now to love that once was mine
Goodbye
