In my neighborhood
Where folks don't live so good now
The rooms are small
Most the building's made of wood

I hear the neighbors
Talking about you and me
Yes, I've heard most every word
Cause the talking's loud and
The walls are much too thin

She don't really love him
Oh, that's what I heard them say
She sure wasn't thinking of him today

I saw her in the front yard now
Say, that girl in room 149
Talking to a boy, well
I've never seen him before
And standing there together
Don't you know they looked so fine

I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
But the talk just never ends
The heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud and
The walls are much too thin

Lord, ain't it sad
Said the woman cross the hall
That when a nice boy falls in love
Hey, it's just too bad
That he just had to fall
For a girl who doesn't
Care for him at all

Well, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I can't stand to hear anymore
But the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins

Oh, they talk so loud and
The walls are much too thin

Whoa, I wish they wouldn't talk so loud
And expose my heartache to all the crowd
