I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more

I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
That I've never, I've never ever
Ever, ever done before

I'll never know
What made it so exciting
When all at once
My heart took flight

And I, and I only
I only know, know
Know, know, know
When she begins to dance
With nobody else but me

I could have danced
Danced, danced all night
Uh huh, huh, huh, huh

And I, I said I only
I only know, know, know
When she begins to dance
With nobody, nobody but me

I could have danced
Danced, danced
Help me, somebody
I could have danced
Danced, danced

Let the music keep playing
I could have danced
Danced, danced all night

I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night...
