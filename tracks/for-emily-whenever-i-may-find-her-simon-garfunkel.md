What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain


I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on


And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand


And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you
