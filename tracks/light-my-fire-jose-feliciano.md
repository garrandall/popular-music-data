You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you, hey
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Mm, the time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Darling, we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Well, you know that it would be untrue
And you know that I would be a liar
If I was to go and tell you
Mama, we couldn't get much higher

Yeah, come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire, yeah
Try to set the night on fire, hey

Hey, come on, baby, light, light my fire, yeah
Come on, babe, light my fire
Don't you know it's all right?
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Oh, light my fire, light my fire, light my fire, yeah, girl
Girl, you better light my fire, yeah
You better light, you better light, you better light my fire
And we're gonna get much higher
Oh, come on, girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I need you, babe
Come on, light, light, light, light my fire
Light my fire
A-light my fire
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Light, light, light, light, light my, light my fire
