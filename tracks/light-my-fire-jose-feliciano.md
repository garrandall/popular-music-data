You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Ooh, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Darling, we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you, hey
Darling, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
...


Oh... listen I'm here to light your fire, baby
Cause you been given me inspiration, darlin'...
And I'm here to fill you with desire


Well then fill me with desire
Light my fire


You light my fire... I'll light your fire
Light your fire, light your fire anytime you want
I'll get you higher... light your fire...
Would you let me, let me, let me, let me love you...


I'll let you...
Come here and light my fire, baby...
Oh... you make me feel so good... so good baby...


Aye! Que rico esta hueso mirar, ooh baby, yeah
Voy a prender ese fuego ese fuego caliente que cosa mas rico
Es asi mama, que buena estas, aye...


Eso es muy cierto muchacho
Que rico esta
