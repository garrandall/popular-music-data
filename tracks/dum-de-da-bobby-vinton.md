You ask me why
Why I love her
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dum de da dee do

I'll tell you why
Why I love her
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dum de da dee do

She understands me
The way you never did
She loves me, she loves me
The way you never did

She takes the time
To notice I'm around
She builds me up
She never lets me down

You want to know
If I'll come back to you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dum de da dee do

After knowing her
No other love will do
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dum de da dee do

She understands me
The way you never did
She loves me, she loves me
The way you never did

She takes the time
To notice I'm around
She builds me up
She never lets me down

After knowing her
No other love will do
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dum de da dee do
