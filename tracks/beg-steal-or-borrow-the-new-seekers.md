You know I'll beg steal or borrow
I bring you love
I look at you and I see what I've been looking for
Now it's very clear to me we should be together
You make me feel I could reach for the impossible
And knowing how much you care, I'll be there forever

You know I'll beg, steal or borrow to give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways I'll bring you love
You know I beg steal or borrow
(Yes, I will)
To make your garden grow
And most of all you know, I bring you love love love
I always knew that the world would be a finer place
So what if I have to wait, better late than never
You you're like me, and you believe love makes it all worthwhile
And although we've just begun, we'll go on forever

You know I'll beg, steal or borrow to give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways I'll bring you love love, yeah
Love, love , love
