I've got a lover way over there on the mountainside
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, she's calling my name


So sweet so plain I can hear her saying
(Come to me, baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)


They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine


'Cause I hear her saying
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna get to you
(Come to me baby)
No matter what I have to do
(Come to me baby)


They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I hear her saying


(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
Baby, when I get there, I ain't going nowhere
(Come to me baby)
Ohh, 'cause a river ain't deep enough
And a mountain ain't steep enough
To keep me from your side


Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come to me baby)
