The satellites that search the night
That twinkle like a star
They send their love from up above
Down to my VTR
The world is at my fingers
Under control


Oh
Video, oh oh!
Play it one more time, oh
Video, oh oh!
Got the world on my TV


I see that rock and roll
And all those old-time movies
They beam across the sky
Together in electric dreams
I just sit here on my end
I'll have it all


Oh
Video, oh oh!
Play it one more time, oh
Video, oh oh!
Got the world on video


I see the shadows in the twilight
As they dance all night long
Video madness comes upon me
Like a trance in the dark
So I just stay right in the world, it's okay


Oh
Video, oh oh!
Play it one more time, oh
Video, oh oh!
Got the world on video


Oh look at me now
I'm burning up the steel in wires
Oh look at me now
I'm burning up the steel in wires
Oh look at me now


Video
Under control
