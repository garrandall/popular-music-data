She came on like the night, and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend
Started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me


How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?

Where did she go
When I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever
And you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on
On the chance that you'll come back to me
Oh, my love


How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling


I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes
And break it down to size
It isn't really fair


How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
