When it hurts too bad
You got to let go
Can't let him know that
He's really gotten to ya

And it hurts so bad
When you're all alone
Those old memories
Keep goin' through ya

And you wanna act nonchalant
But you can't 
'Cause he keeps on haunting you

And when it hurts so bad
Gotta try and pretend
He's just a casual friend
Who never meant a thing to ya

Well you can fool your friends
And you can laugh a lot
It's all a cover up
Of what he really means to ya

And you try and act nonchalant
But you can't 
'Cause he keeps on haunting you
Yes, and it hurts so bad

Oh, how can it hurt this bad
When it was never planned
But you stole my heart
And here I am
I'm possessed by you
I'm obsessed with you
What I tryin' to say
Is I love you

Now how can I act nonchalant
When all I want is 
To spend the night with you

Oh, when it hurts this bad
You got to let go
Can't let him know that
He's really gotten to ya

And it hurts so bad
When you're all alone
Those old memories
Keep goin' through ya

And it hurts so bad
Oh, I know it hurts so bad
Whoa, it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I know it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
