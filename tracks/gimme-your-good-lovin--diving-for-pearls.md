I'm in love and I'm in deep
When my hands start to shiver
My knees get weak, I can't eat and I can't sleep
Just a kiss from you, baby, is all I need

Anyway, you want it
That's the way you'll get it
Anyway, you want it to be
Anyway, you want it

That's the way you'll get it
Anyway, you want it
Just gimme, gimme your good loving
Gimme, gimme your good love

All I want, you're all I need
Now I'll do anything, just to make you see
Now I know, and it's for sure
Baby, I got the fever, you've got the cure

Anyway, you want it
That's the way you'll get it
Anyway, you want it to be
Anyway, you want it

That's the way you'll get it
Anyway, you want it
Just gimme, gimme your good loving
Gimme, gimme your good love

Gimme, gimme your good loving
Gimme your good loving
Gimme, gimme your good love
Gimme your good love

Gimme, gimme your good loving
Gimme your good loving
Gimme, gimme your good love
Gimme your good love

Gimme, gimme your good loving
Gimme your good loving
Gimme, gimme your good love
Gimme your good love
