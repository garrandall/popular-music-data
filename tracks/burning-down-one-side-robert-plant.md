Slipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance,
How could I fall without a shove
Tip-toed like thunder on my feelings
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are weak - my head is reeling
Consumed by the fire in your eyes
Stepped in and shattered my defences,
Just playing hookey with my heart
Slipped through the window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart, yes my poor heart

Try as I might - try as I may
Yes I'll try anything to make you stay
Cause I need your love - yes I need your love --
I'm looking high - I'm looking low,
Can't find where did my baby go
Gotta find out why she ran away
I don't know where did my baby stay
Try as I might - try as I may
Yes I'll try anything to make you stay

Fire down the Boulevard d'Amour
Shoot through the neon in the night
Hot foot through alleys - check the doorways
Try that old parking lot on Ninth
There's three-course kissing in the same place
But that don't help me out no more
I've been away so long and dreaming
Little girl ain't I seen you before
