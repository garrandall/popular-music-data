She walked through the corn leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like the fox on the run
Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run

Everybody knows the reason for the fall
When woman tempted man down in paradise's hall
This woman tempted me all yes, then took me for a ride
But like the weary fox I need a place to hide

She walked through the corn leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like the fox on the run
Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run

Come take a glass of wine and fortify your soul
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I'll illustrate, a girl who put me on the floor
The game is nearly up, the hounds are at my door

I saw her walk through the corn leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that her poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run

You know she walked throught the corn leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that her poor boy could give her
Left me to die
Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run
