Here's something that you never had
Slid in on an oily rag
The price is right up on the tag
I'll put in a brand new bag

This thing will let you be yourself
And won't offend nobody else
Nothing like you ever saw
And it's not against the law

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time

People thinking they've been took
Just finding out they overlooked
They never found the missing link
Forgot they had a mind to think

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time

Check out your mind
Check out your mind
Check out your mind

Trust in me and I in you
No matter what you see me do
I'm doing me for all I'm worth
None do me better on this earth

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time

Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time

Check out your mind
Check out your mind
Check out your mind
...
