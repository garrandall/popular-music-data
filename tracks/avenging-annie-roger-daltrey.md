They ran through hills and forest
As two under a spell
He was a city boy Floyd the outlaw
And she thought she new him well

Long after that great summer
When she first came into her fame
And the Avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to her name
The Avenger she became


Well they call her Avenging Annie
The avenger of womanhood
She spends her whole life telling lies
Leads him on a mess and over good

She'll take all these spoiled young hippies
Running around playing games
They're surrounding your bed, she'll blow your head
She'll put you through a change
What you've done to others
She'll do unto you


Then she met her sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing she'd ever seen
She was to be his wife for the rest of her life
But she was so blind she could never had seen
No!
So she joined up with her outlaw
And headed for California


He treated her worse than she'd ever imagined
He didn't say he didn't want her around
He kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong
He run her right into the ground
After five long years
He picked her up and slapped her down


Then she told her friends about him
They all were on her side
But she could see through the haze he looked so pale
She put her head right down and she cried
For her poor lover
She cried like a mother for her poor lover


And now she lives on the mountain top
And she's almost thirty-five
And she's found her peace and found her release
Happy just to be alive

And she might go back to her Floyd
If she thinks it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft right after she left
And you know she still loves him too


Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you

Well they call her Avenging Annie
The avenger of womanhood
She spends her whole life telling lies
Leads them on a mess and over good
