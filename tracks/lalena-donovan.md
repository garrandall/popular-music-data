When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya
Lalena

Arty-tart, la-de-da
Can your part get much sadder?
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya
Lalena

Run your hand through your hair
Paint your face with despair
That's your lot in life, Lalena
Can't blame ya
Lalena

When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life, Lalena
I can't blame ya
Lalena

Arty-tart, oh so la-de-da
Can your part ever get, ever get much sadder?
That's your lot in life, Lalena
I can't blame ya
No, no, no, Lalena
Oh, Lalena
