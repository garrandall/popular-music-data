Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Ha ha, yeah

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel

You know, pop goes the weasel
For years, I've wondered
What that meant
And nobody seemed to know

So, I looked it up
And the official explanation
Goes something like this

Pop goes the weasel refers to
The habit of London hatters long ago
Popping or pawning their weasels
Or accessories on Saturday night
To buy liquor, isn't that interesting

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

But you know
I've got a theory of my own
About pop goes the weasel
It's much simpler

Why did the weasel go pop, go pop
Pop, pop goes the weasel
Why did the weasel go pop
'Cause they upped the price
Of tuppeny rice to four pence

How did the pop get into the weasel
Weasel, pop goes the weasel
How did the pop get in there
Well, the weasel caught his
Beakle in the treacle

Now, if you've got a weasel
And you don't want him to pop
The next time you go shopping
Don't you take him in the shop
Two, three, four

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now that is the way
That the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's sitting on the table
Now I take a stick
And I knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Together now

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now, I mix it up
And I make it nice
Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel

Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel
Poppity, poppity, pop
Goes the weasel now

Would you excuse me for a moment
I'm just gonna pop my weasel
