I am insensitive, I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I don't know why you stay with me.

I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
And I wish that I could be more like you.

I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
Well, I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.
Love me good.

Girl, you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted,
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.

You love me good.
