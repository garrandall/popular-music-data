I ain't never been with a woman long enough for my boots to get old
We've been together so long now they both need re-soled
If I ever settle down you'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me to head on down the line


Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong


I'm the kind of man who likes to get away
Like to start dreaming 'bout tomorrow today
Never said that I love you even though it's so
Where's that duffel bag of mine, it's time to go


Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gonna be leavin' at the break of dawn
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
Goin' sneak out that door, couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a teardrop in your eye


Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong


I never had a damn thing but what I had, I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder and I guess I always will


Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
