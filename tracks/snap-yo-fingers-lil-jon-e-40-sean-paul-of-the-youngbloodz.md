Niggas in my face
Damn near every day
Aska million questions like Joc where you stay
Tell 'em College Park
Where they chop cars
In 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Just bought a zone
J's on my feet
I'm on that Patrone so get like me
'69 cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood
Posted at the store
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough
If ya girl choose
Let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass nice brain
Everbody love me
I'm so fly
Nigga throw the dueces everytime I ride by
I know you wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just
Do what you do


Meet me in the Trap
It's goin down
Meet me in the mall
It's goin down
Meet me in the club
It's goin down
Anywhere you meet me guaranteed to go down


Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

Snap ya fingers and then rock with it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, gon drop with it
Do a step with it, put ya hips with it
All my ladies let me see ya put a twist with it
You can't do like me, I'm by myself
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else
What's happenin', what's up
Got da purk fired up
What's happenin', what's up
Got Patrone in my cup
I pop, I drank
I'm on Patrone and purk, I can't thank
I'm blowed, to tha do'
Don't know how tha hell I'm gettin home


Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Anywhere you meet me guaranteed to go down


Do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck
Pocket fulla Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall
Hoes just pause
Pop a few tags gimme dat on da wall
Time to flip the work
Make the block bump
Boys N da Hood
Call me Black by my trunk
Dope Boy magic
7 days a week
Number one record
Long as Nitty on the beat


Straight from da bay, posted in tha 'A'
Bout to hit tha club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' some?, dyin' off Patrone
VIP style, strapped with my chrome
Look around tha club, what do I see'
Everybody rockin' from side to side to tha beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to tha groove
All by they self, that's tha new move
Nigga where I'm from, we like to go?
I'm soakin' up tha game, I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said tha Pool Palace
Staright from Bankhead, I said you good at it
Do what cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, tha more it's lookin' smooth
It's nuthin to a boss, I can do tha shit too


Ooh I think they like me
Betta yet I know
LIghts, camera, action
When I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew we certified stars
Valet in the front bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black in the coupe
Girls likin Girls
Time to recruit
If you gotta problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up anytime any place


Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it - meet me in the mall
It's goin down
Meet me in the club (aye)
It's goin down
Anywhere you meet me (aye)
Guaranteed to go down


Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!


Chillin' in tha bip, yeah we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up tha kush, put it in tha air
I'm throwin' up tha E's to let em' know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out tha ol school, cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from tha 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from tha deck
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on tha best, we don't fuck with dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to tha track, back to tha snap
1, 2 step, then you gotta lean back
Dis is how we do it in tha 'A town'
(and if you ain't know) this how it go down


Time to set it off
Let these niggas know
Have they ever seen a Chevy with them butterfly doors
I ride real slow no need to speak
Gotta make sure they see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean cause I never touch do'
Everytime I see 'em look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know? It's me surprise
Put it in the air rep where you stay
Take a step back blow the Kush in they face
Stuntin is a habit
Let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga I ain't 'fraid to share it


Meet me in the Trap
It's goin down
Meet me in the mall
It's goin down
Meet me in the club
It's goin down
Anywhere you meet me guaranteed to go down


Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

Hey hey!
