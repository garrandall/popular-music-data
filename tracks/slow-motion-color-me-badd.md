To get my timing right

Come over here & get a little bit closer to me (yeah)
The time has come for me to love you real slow (slow)
Motion lover is what they call me (good God)

I like to love you in slow motion (oh got it goin on) (slow)
Let me love you slow (slow)
I like to love you slow so morning will come before I do
Let me love you slow (how ya wanna do it baby)
