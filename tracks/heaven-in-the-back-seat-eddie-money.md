Young girl, looking to take a ride
Gonna get to love you if it takes all night
I wanna get, huh next to you

She's got what I want, I got what she needs
Me and my baby, and the mirror makes three

It's heaven in the backseat
Got the heaven in the backseat
(Backseat, baby)

You can't turn it down, you won't turn me round
(You won't do it)
I know you like it, I love what I see
I got your number, your number is me

Oh, baby, come and start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I'll drive you crazy with my backseat love

Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
You'll be in heaven in my backseat, baby

(Come on, start me up)
Come on, start me up
(Come on, fire me up)
You got to fire me up, oh, oh

Television off, radio on
Shook my magic on and have a little fun
I smile like a private eye
I'm looking for the woman with the perfect plan

Heaven in the backseat
(Backseat, baby)

(You can't turn me down)
You can't turn me down
(You won't turn me round)
You won't turn me round

(You won't do it)
I know you like it, I love what I see
I got your number, your number is me

Oh, baby, come on, start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I'll drive you crazy with my backseat love

Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
You`ll be in heaven in my backseat, baby

(Come on, start me up)
Come on and start me up
(Come on, fire me up)
Got to fire me up, oh, oh

Don't stop me, the body rocking
You gotta love it
(Love it, love it)
Oh yeah
(Oh yeah)

Oh, yeah, you hit the spot
Your love is hot
Blood pressure going up
Exploding

(You can't turn me down)
You can't turn me down
(You won't turn me round)
You won't turn me round

(You can't do it)
I know you like it, I love what I see
I got your number, your number is me

Oh, baby, come on and start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I'll drive you crazy with my backseat love

Come on and fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
You'll be in heaven with my backseat love

Come on, start me up
Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
Come on, start me up
Oh, oh, come on

You'll be in heaven, heaven in the backseat
Come on, come on, start me up
Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
