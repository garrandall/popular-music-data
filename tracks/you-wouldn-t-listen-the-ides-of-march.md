I told you he was no fool
(You wouldn't listen to me)
He'll break your heart
(You wouldn't listen to me)
He'll tear it apart
(You wouldn't listen to me)
So you better get smart
(You wouldn't listen to me)

(Chorus)
You wouldn't listen to me
You wouldn't hear what I got to see
You wouldn't listen to me
Now you have gotta pay
You've gotta pay

You've been untrue
(You wouldn't listen to me)
I said he's watching you
(You wouldn't listen to me)
So watch what you do
(You wouldn't listen to me)
Or you'll wreck your life too

(Repeat Chorus)

I gave you plenty of warning
You wouldn't listen to what I say
Now you are in mourning
I see that you're in a mighty bad way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I told you he was no fool
(You wouldn't listen to me)
He'll break your heart
(You wouldn't listen to me)
He'll tear it apart
(You wouldn't listen to me)
So you better get smart
(You wouldn't listen to me)

(Repeat Chorus)

You wouldn't to me
Now you have gotta pay
You've gotta pay
(Repeat)
