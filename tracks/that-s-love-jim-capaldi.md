One day you're up
Next day you're down
She's got your head
Spinning around

That's love
It's happening all the time

You walk out the door
Head for the train
Then in a while
You're back again

That's love, you'll never change the world
Not in a million years

And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times

One gentle heart easily burned
After a lifetime
You still haven't learned
That's love, it's happening all the time

And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times

Young couple there
Going insane
Fussing and fighting
Then they make up again

That's love, it's happening all the time
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
No, no, no, no

You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
