Hear the night music playing?
Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever

Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there too

Now's the time our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Time to show all your feeling
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you

Now we turn into music
Now we will never lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in
All this love for the taking

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in
All this love for the taking

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?
