The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me.
The sun could never thaw away
The the bliss that lays around me.


Let it rain, let it rain,
Let your love rain down on me.
Let it rain, let it rain,
Let it rain, rain, rain.

Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun.
Until I found the way to love,
It's harder said than done.



Now I know the secret;
There is nothing that I lack.
If I give my love to you,
You'll surely give it back.
