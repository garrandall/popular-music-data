Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache, from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

(Pain!)
When everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything (You make me a, you make a believer) everything you touch
Turns to gold (believer) gold

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all (after all)
This city never sleeps tonight

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side we used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

I'm on top of the world (Hey!)
I'm on top of the world (Hey!)
Been waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile (Hey!)
Been holding it in for a while (Hey!)
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You've gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You've gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
('Cause I'm a bad liar)

I've bet my life
(You make me a, you make me a believer)
I've bet my life for you
Feel the thunder
And the lightning
()
And the thunder
(I'm never changing who I am)
I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world
(Yeah you're a natural)
I'm on top of the world
