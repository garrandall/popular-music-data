I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me


Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me


Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love
What would life be?


So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love
What would life be?


So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
