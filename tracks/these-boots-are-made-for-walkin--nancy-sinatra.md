You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You've been messing where you shouldn't have been messing
And now someone else is getting all your best


These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
Yeah


You keep lying when you ought to be truthing
You keep losing when you ought to not bet
You keep saming when you ought to be changing
Now, what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet


These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you


You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burnt, hah
Well, I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn


These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you


Are you ready, boots?
Start walking
