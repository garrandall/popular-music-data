You keep saying you've got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
That you've been messing where you shouldn't have been messing
And now someone else is getting all your best

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

And you keep lying when you ought to be be truthing
And you keep losing when you ought to not bet
Yeah and you keep same-ing when you ought to be changing
Now what's right is right, but ain't been right yet

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

And you keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you could never get burned
Yeah well I just found me a brand new box of matches
And what do you know, you ain't got time to learn

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking
