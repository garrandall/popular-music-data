You no longer have
The look of love in your eye
There are no sweet kisses
When you say goodbye
You used to call me
At least once every day
Now I speak to you once a week
I'm sorry to say


I can feel your love slipping away
Losing the feeling more
And more each day
And this makes me sad (sad)
And it hurts (hurts)
It hurts, hurts so bad
I have been faithful and true
Did what a lover is suppose to do
But I guess that was not enough for you


Baby, we were so happy
Always together (together)
I was so sure a love like ours
Would last forever (forever)
Never did have a fight or fuss
Now someone has come between us


I can feel your love slipping away
Losing the feeling more
And more each day
I can feel your love...
