(Daron)
What is this, numbers in your pocket?
I remember when you used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now
Who gave you a reason to act so shady?

Baby you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand baby..


Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (it's over now)

(Slim)
You think that I don't know what's goin' on
'cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
'cause you can't even fade me -
I know you're messin around baby

Baby you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand baby..

 - repeat twice
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (it's over now)

(Daron)
Baby it's a shame - shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me, and I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk, talk about our problems
Instead of running away

(Slim)
Oh baby it's a shame, we couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about, (the feelings we had from the start)
The feelings we had, my heart will always be with you
Girl it's a shame..


Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (it's over now)
(repeat til end)
