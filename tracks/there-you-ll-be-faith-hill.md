When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me...


In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be


Well, you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me


In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be


'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me (You were right there for me)
You were right there for me
For always


In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be


There you'll be...
