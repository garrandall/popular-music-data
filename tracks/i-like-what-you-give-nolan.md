Anything you want baby, you can have it
You can cut my head off like John The Baptist
We can sleep together on a burning mattress
I don't give a fuck man, whatever the plan is
We can come together like a new messiah
We'll kick the heathens out, Goddamn pariahs
We're dancing in the street, setting cars on fâire
Because we don't have to answer to these cowards and liars

There's a price to pay but you can't defâine it
So lose yourself in the mindless violence
Hold your head high while you watch in silence
And say it for yourself, this is what you wanted

Say it for yourself, this is what you wanted
It's all over now baby, no surprises
There's nothing left in that life you haunted
So say it to yourself, say it to yourself
So say it to yourself, this is what you wanted

Drinking black whiskey in the fâiery furnace
I'm talking about faith, not a thing can burn us
Saving our souls but it's not on purpose
Because God only knows that it's barely worth it

There's a price to pay but you can't defâine it
So lose yourself in the mindless violence
Hold your head high while you watch in silence
And say it for yourself, this is what you wanted

Say it for yourself, this is what you wanted
It's all over now baby, no surprises
There's nothing left in that life you haunted
So say it to yourself, this is what you wanted

Say it for yourself, this is what you wanted
It's all over now baby, no surprises
There's nothing left in that life you haunted
So say it to yourself, say it to yourself
So say it to yourself, this is what you wanted

There's no fantasy
No new horizon
We're running circles
We're killing time here
So beg forgiveness for the sins of your past
And keep living life like it's going to last

Say it for yourself, this is what you wanted
It's all over now baby, no surprises
There's nothing left in that life you haunted
So say it to yourself, this is what you wanted

Say it for yourself, this is what you wanted
It's all over now baby, no surprises
There's nothing left in that life you haunted
So say it to yourself, say it to yourself
Say it to yourself
