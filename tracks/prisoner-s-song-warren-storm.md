If I
Had wings
Like an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die

Take my wife
My child
And your own mother
We would just
Sit and sleep
Each day
It's alone and so lonely
In this prison
But for wrongs
I have done
I must pay

You know I'm lost
Like a ship
On the ocean
That has lost
All it's crew
In a gale
I got drunk
And I shot
My best buddy
Now I must
Spend my life in jail

Though if I
Had the wings of an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die
