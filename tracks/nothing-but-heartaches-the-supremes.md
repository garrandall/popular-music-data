Nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
He brings nothing but heartaches
I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

All my life 
I needed someone to need me
So I do my very best to please him
But the more and more I care
The more of him other girls share
When I need a hand to hold
That's the time he leaves me all alone
Just keeps me, keeps me crying myself to sleep

He brings nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away
Oh, no keep a loving him more each day
Oh, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too
But the more my love has grown
The less love he had shown

He makes promises he doesn't keep
Sometimes I don't see him all week
Just keeps me, keeps me crying myself to sleep

He brings nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away
Oh, no keep a loving him more each day
Oh, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss
'Cause his kiss I'll shouldn't miss

Nothing but heartaches
Ooh, nothing but heartaches
I can't break away, oh no
Keep a loving him more each day
