Sitting up here watching all the lights blink down below
The earth is turning, why does it go so slow?
Thinking about the girl I left behind
Houston can you hear me, or have I lost my mind?
Why me? Why me?

I was waiting on the pad, all systems were go
The man up in the tower was enjoying the show
Then I got this feeling that I never had before
Hey let me out of here, what am I here for?
Why me?

There must be a thousand other guys
Must be some other way to look good in your eyes
Why am I up here? What do they see in me?
Must be one thousand other places to be
Why me? Why Me?

The last man to be here was never heard from again
He won't be back this way till 2010
Now I'm riding on a fountain of fire
With my back to the earth, I go higher and higher
Why me? Why me?

There must be a thousand other guys
Must be some other way to look good in your eyes
Why am I up here? What do they see in me?
Must be one thousand other places to be
Why me? Why me?
Take anyone but me. Why me?
Take anyone but me. Why me?
