There's a lot of ways of saying
What I wanna say to you
There are songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll just come right out and tell, oh, you I'd love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down
There's so many ways your sweet love's made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing little things that really turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen In your faded cotton gown
Oh, darling how I'd love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place
You'll still be beatiful and I'll still be around
And if I can't I know that I'd still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
Oh, darlin' how I love to lay you down.
