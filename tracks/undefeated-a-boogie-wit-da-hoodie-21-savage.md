M-M-M-Murda
Yeah, yeah


I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
I'm like, "Can I get some company?"
I'm like, "Damn I'm really undefeated", yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
Like can I get some company
Like damn I'm really undefeated, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like damn I'm really undefeated
Damn I'm really, damn I'm really, yeah, yeah


Am I really undefeated?
It's like I got the secret stuff but I don't ever need it, yeah
You flexing 'cause you wanna be me
I'm flexing on these niggas for a better reason, yeah, yeah
Fuck it, I guess they would never understand that
Rollie iced out, timeless for the hashtag
I get mad bread, fuck a damn fed
If he tell that's a man down, leave that man dead
I'm just saying, I ain't playing around, I ain't playing fair
I don't care, fuck a one-on-one, ain't no hands here
Hah, now they call me evil
Laughing at these niggas with a Desert Eagle, yeah


I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
I'm like, "Can I get some company?"
I'm like, "Damn I'm really undefeated", yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
Like can I get some company
Like damn I'm really undefeated, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like damn I'm really undefeated
Damn I'm really, damn I'm really, yeah, yeah


I think it's catching up to me
Riding in a Hellcat, ain't no catching up to me
This is not a 458, this a GTB
The Maybach came with a new TV, headshots, fuck feet
Bitch I got more bodies than a general in Vietnam
Fuck yo nigga, he a bum, strippers picking up the crumbs
Hundreds in my pocket, you would think that I had beef with ones
Fuck her like she Nia Long (21)
Yeah my clip long, fucking up my hipbone (21)
Steve Stephen ass nigga now your bitch gone (On God)
I just whipped a quarter brick and now my wrist gone
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie 'til the clip gone
Alley Sosa get you whacked off a flip phone
Zone 6 niggas love sending hits home
Bodies catching up to me but I'm too rich for 'em (21, 21)


I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
I'm like, "Can I get some company?"
I'm like, "Damn I'm really undefeated", yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it's catching up to me
Nobody's catching up to me
Like can I get some company
Like damn I'm really undefeated, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like damn I'm really undefeated
Damn I'm really, damn I'm really, yeah, yeah
