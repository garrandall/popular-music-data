Cover me, cover me
Spread your precious love all over me
Oh, can't you see the need in me?
Oh, cover me, cover me

Hide me, hide me
Where no other can find me
Oh, I'm feeling cold, I need you so
Oh, cover me, cover me

Girl, my love for you gets stronger everyday
Oh, temptation might be waiting down the way
When I'm lost and I get led astray
Find me, find me
Can't stop the little tear that blinds me
Oh darling, I don't want to lose you
Oh, find me

Stay with me, stay with me
Baby, make it all the way with me
Oh, everyday and every way
Stay with me, you stay with me

Cover me, cover me
Spread your precious love all over me
Oh, can't you see the need in me?
Oh, cover me, cover me

Cover me, cover me
Spread your precious love all over me
Oh, can't you see?
