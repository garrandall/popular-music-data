Girl: Don't call me with that bullshit, alright?
Guy: You lying, you lying to me, B
Girl: Yeah, exactly
Guy: Whose dick you sucking? C'mon B, I just heard some shit about you, some foul shit. The fuck is the deal?
Girl: Suck my fucking dick, you bitch-ass nigga! I don't
Guy: No, you explain it to me, bitch. You know what I'm talking about
Girl: I don't know nobody up here! I don't fuck with nobody up here and I ain't been fucking with nobody up here! I don't know nobody in fucking Yonkers!
Guy: Lying-ass bitch. You ain't shit. Do I got to holler his name too?
Girl: Who the fuck is he!?
Guy: Bitch, you fuckin' him!

What type of games is bein' played, how's it goin' down?
(All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now
(All I want)
Is you with me or what? Think I'm trying to get me a nut
(All I want is you)
Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what
(All I want is you)

I'm politickin' with this chicken, wonderin' if I'ma creep her
Little hoodrat bitch from 25th named Tenika
Comin' through, like I do, you know, gettin' my bark on
Knew she was a thug 'cause when I met her she had a scarf on
5411, size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend, remember me (what?) from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them
Doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up
Aight? Hit you on the jack later on, see whassup
Talkin' to shorty made me wanna do somethin' nice
Lookin' at that ass made me wanna do somethin' tonight
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight
She bite, better give a nigga the green light, we mightâ€¦

I'm gettin' at shorty like, "What you need? What you want?"
Want for nothin', 'cause I got you, but you front?
I see you with your baby father, but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I'da kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me (true)
Heard he smacked you
'Cause you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (what?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kids daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 1-5-0, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that; you with that?

Ayo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves, 'cause she smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, get's the dues
Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down like what
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be "yeah"
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be best of friends, haha
Mad love, boo, to the end, tada
