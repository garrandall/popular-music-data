Alright

Gonna catch a flight to Nevada
Leave her friends at home in L.A.
Seven come eleven or blackjack
Gamblin' in night and day, yeah

'Cause she's a roller, now, a high roller baby
Mmm, she's a roller, yeah, a high roller baby
Alright, woo!

She likes to play for double or nothin'
She's tellin' all the boys she's hot
And everybody knows she's ready
To give it everything that she got

Oh she's a roller, now, a high roller baby, my my
Oh she's a roller, yeah, a high roller baby
Look out, oh

Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye

People try to tell her she's crazy
She doesn't hear a word they say
Tellin' all the boys to get ready
'Cause she's givin' it all away

Oh she's a roller, yeah (Roller), a high roller baby, yeah
She's a roller, yeah (Roller), a high roller baby, she is

She's a roller (Roller), a high roller baby, yeah
She's a roller (Roller), a high roller baby, oh

Bye-bye (Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Ow!
