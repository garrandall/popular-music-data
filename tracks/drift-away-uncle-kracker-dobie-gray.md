You wonder how I done it
I'm about to tell you how
It took a lot of long lonely nights
Riding round
I got some good friends
Piled up in my truck
When you woud knock me down
They were there to pick up
You thought that I was weak
You tried to play me foolish
You tried to drag me down
But I just couldn't do it
I mashed the gas pedal
And flipped the brights on
Hit highway 41 and let the bygones be bygones
Try to get lost
Cause I got nowhere to be
Gotta clear my mind and let the music set me free

Oh, oh I learned it from the radio
Dashboard glow, banging on the console
Singin at the top of my lungs
Wakin this whole town up
Riding round all night, in circles
Chasing headlights down that old dirt road
If you wanna know how I let you go
I learned it from the radio
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I learned it from the radio

You wanna know who's with me
It's all my rowdy friends
I'm talkin Al Dean, Hank Jr., Will.i.am
We roll the windows down
And bump the system loud
And keep it going til we blowin all the speakers out
Don't care how late it is
Could give less than a damn
Might pull off in a cul de sac
And pop a can
Sittin on the tailgate
Lookin at the night sky
In sync with the universe, bye, bye, bye
The longer I drive, the better I feel
My arm out the window
And one hand on the wheel

Oh, oh I learned it from the radio
Dashboard glow, banging on the console
Singin at the top of my lungs
Wakin this whole town up
Riding round all night, in circles
Chasing headlights down that old dirt road
If you wanna know how I let you go
I learned it from the radio
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I learned it from the radio

I fill it up and put that Silverado in the wind
And when my song comes on
I turn the volume up to 10
And I just drift away
To Uncle Kracker, Dobie Gray
Man, whatever, let it play
Switchin channels, switchin lanes
To some old jurassic classic
Sang by what's her name
I went from sad to mellow
Mellow to happy to laughin
And now it's like you and me never happened
Like you and me never happened

Oh, oh I learned it from the radio
Dashboard glow, banging on the console
Singin at the top of my lungs
Wakin this whole town up
Riding round all night, in circles
Chasing headlights down that old dirt road
If you wanna know how I let you go
I learned it from the radio
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I learned it from the radio
