Boy you got me nauseous
I just eat and eat
Hair so messy
In fact its pulled in a weave 
Phone keeps oh ringin' but it's not you
So i don't pick it up
Friends told me but it dont help
Cause boy you got me stuck


Why did you mess it up
Cause i wont be learnin'
My girls 
try to tell me
But i had to learn the hard way
Now i'm so confused
What am i to do
I'm caught up in this madness
Something please take me away


I'm losing sleep, and i cant eat
Can't even think
I'm losin' my mind
I hate your guts, love you so much
I'm crackin' up
I'm losin' my mind


Never would of thought that
We would be here
Promises to me
Said that you were different
And i bought it
Should of kept a reciept





This aint me
Cant eat cant sleep
Cause so many are losing their mind
Cause in my robe
Our love is no joke
This aint no joke
I'm losin' my mind





See my boss said your crazy
My girls had to tell me
You don't deserve me
Got me going crazy
What am i to do
I'm lost without you boy
