Don't look now
Things just got worse
I'm drunk again
I swear this crescent
Is just a curse

I got here
By killing off all my friends
I think I figured it out
My life begins when the fun ends

I've got my wings
I'm free to go as I please
Yeah, I got my wings
Now nothing really pleases me

'Til everything falls apart
Then I get to try to put it back together
Yeah, it falls apart
And you can count on that
You can count on bad, bad weather again

Was it good?
I don't remember much about it
When things start to feel right
You can count on me to start to doubt it

And the devil's not in the details
No, the devil is in my pants
And it's shoot first, apologize later
Another quick end to a short shod romance

Well, I got what I wanted
Now I don't want anything
Yeah, I got what I wanted
Now my life is just boring

'Til everything falls apart
Then I get to try to put it back together
Yeah, it falls apart
And you can count on that
You can count on bad, bad weather this year

I met God this afternoon
Riding on an uptown train
I said "Don't you have better things to do?"
He said, "If I do my job, what would you complain about?
So I let it go to Hell
Now I'll have something to do"
He said, "I let it go to Hell
Does that sound familiar to you?"

Well, everything falls apart
Then I get to try to put it back together
Yeah, it falls apart
And you can count on that
You can count on bad, bad weather

Everything that falls apart baby
Sooner or later gonna come back together
Well, everything that come together baby
Sooner or later gonna fall apart

And you can call it anything you want
They're gonna take it all away from you
You're gonna wake up, wake up, wake up
Scarecrow and find yourself lost again
