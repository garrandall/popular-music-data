(CHORUS)
Big time (big, big time)
I'm gonna make it to the
Big time (big, big time)
I'm gonna make it
To the big time
All for you, baby
Just for you, baby

I'm leaving the gang on the corner
And leaving my baby behind
But only for a short time
Only for a short time

And I won't stop
Til I make it to the top
You'll walk beside me
And become society

(CHORUS) 2X

I won't go home til I make it
And I'll be knocking at your door
But in the scene, we'll be there
All the small time we'll just bear

And I won't stop
Til I make it to the top
My promise to you
Will live on forever

(CHORUS) 2X

I'm gonna make it
To the big time...
