When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right infront of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the broken hearted people living in this world with me
There will be an answer
Let it be
And though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Let it shine on until tomorrow
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
