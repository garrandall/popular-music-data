Walking through the park
It wasn't quite dark
There was a man
Sitting on a bench

Out of the crowd
As his head lowly bowed
He just moaned and
He made no sense

He'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um

I just couldn't help myself
Yes, I was born
With a curious mind

I asked this man
Just what did he mean
When he moaned
If he'd be so kind

And he'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um

Now that I've grown up
And the woman I love
She has gone

Now that I'm a man
I think I understand
Sometimes everyone
Must sing this song

Listen to me sing
Um, um, um, um, um

Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um

Everybody now
Um, um, um, um, um

Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um
