Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina
You know we smokinâ on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?
(Cool)


36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina (Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina)
Ridinâ with a hoe named Keisha, smokinâ on Keisha (You know we smokinâ on Keisha)
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you hoe?" (Hey can I meet you hoe?)
She fly high, high in the sky, hoe I canât see you (Well I canât see you)
Got a condo on my wrist - girl, Iâm cashinâ out (Iâm cashinâ out)
Got a condo around my neck - girl, Iâm cashinâ out (Iâm cashinâ out)
36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you?"


I got Versace all on my back, these hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back, cause they know Iâm movinâ that pack
These Louies all in my face, foâ-fifth stay up on my waist
Plus it ainât on me for nothinâ, so please donât make me catch a case
Cause bitch Iâm âbout it, me walkinâ âround with no check on me
Psssh - yeah I doubt it!
Your girl ainât finna leave with me? Psssh - yeah I doubt it!
And Iâm like, what the hell they talkinâ âbout?
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know Iâm cashinâ out (cool)


36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina (Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina)

Got a condo around my neck - girl, Iâm cashinâ out (Iâm cashinâ out)
36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina

Okay I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they cominâ by flocks in
Birds cominâ by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money, Iâm poppinâ
No actinâ, but itâs a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ainât losing
Donât act like yoâ hoe ainât choosinâ
Iâm blowed up, yeah Iâm the bomb, ridinâ round blowinâ on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms, top floâ suite chillinâ at The Palms
We want the whole loaf leave yâall the crumbs, âtil then Iâm runninâ my check up
And itâs fuck a Bugatti; Iâm callinâ my jet up (cool)


36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina (Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina)

Got a condo around my neck - girl, Iâm cashinâ out (Iâm cashinâ out)
36 Oâs so Iâm ridinâ âround with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you?"


Yeah - itâs big pimpinâ over here - touch
Time to cop the Maybach already had the âvert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumpinâ out the kitchen
And Iâm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice, just like you playinâ hockey
And in the booth, I beat the beat up
Call me Rocky, yeah Iâm cocky (cool)
