I've got to be honest
I think you know
We're covered in lies and that's okay
But there's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say


Never again, no
No never again


'Cause you're a god
And I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god
And I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go


Though I've been unable
To put you down
I'm still learnin' things I ought to know by now
It's under the table, so...
I need somethin' more to show, somehow


So never again, no
No never again


'Cause you're a god
And I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god
And I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go


I've got to be honest
I think you know
We're covered in lies and that's okay
But there's somewhere beyond this,I know
But I hope I can find the words to say...


Never again, no
No never again


'Cause you're a god
And I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god
And I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go


(You're a god)
Oh, and I am not
(I just thought that you would know)
Oh, I thought that would you know
(You're a god)
Oh, and I am not
I just thought I'd let you go
