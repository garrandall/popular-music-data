Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Hearts?
I'll never know why I don't understand
He's always saying that there's no one else
While he's doin' what hurts the most
When you tell a lie, you're always
found out
And it's wrong
Use up your patience but she's back again
Crying and laughing, does she love the pain?
And when you tell a lie, you're always
found out
It's wrong
