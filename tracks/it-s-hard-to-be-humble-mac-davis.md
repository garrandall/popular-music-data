Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can

I used to have me a girlfriend
But I guess that she couldn't compete
With all of them love-starved women
Who keep clamouring round at my feet
I could probably find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares, I'll never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company

Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can

I guess you could say I'm a loner
A cowboy out lone, tough, and proud
I could have lot of friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin tight blue jeans

Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can
Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can
