As high as the moon
So high were my spirits
When you sang out my name

And coming from you
It was enough just to hear it
Oh, it rang like the bells did today

But even the sturdiest ground
Can shift and can tremble and let us fall down

Kindly unspoken
You show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words
It's lucky I'm clever
If I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard

In the days of my folly
I followed your lead
Did what Simon Said to do

But I won't let melancholy
Play me for a fool
Oh, no I'm on my way somewhere new

And as far as your lack of something to say
Well, to tell me goodbye there was no better way



So don't keep me up till the dawn
With words that'll keep leading me on
I know much better than to wait for an answer from you
