Well well, I once believed all fellas were nice
But girls, listen to me, take my advice
Girls, you'd better get yourselves onto my track
'Cause findin' a good man, girls, is like findin' a


(Needle in a haystack)
What did I say, girls?
(Needle in a haystack)
(She-doop, she-doop, la la, he-doop, she-doop, la la)


Girls, those fellas are sly, slick and shy
So don't you ever let 'em get you starry-eyed
Well, you may think their love is true
But they'll walk right over you


Now girls, you should know these things right off the back
'Cause findin' a good man, girls, is like findin' a


(Needle in a haystack)
What did I say, girls?
(Needle in a haystack)
(She-doop, she-doop, la la, he-doop, she-doop, la la)


Now girls, I say I'm tellin' you the natural facts
'Cause findin' a good man, girls, is like findin' a


(Needle in a haystack)
What did I say, girls?
(Needle in a haystack)


I'm tellin' you, girls, you'd better look before you leap
Still water sometimes runs very deep
You'll be sorry when you just jump
And do justice passed by love


Girls, you should know these things right off the back
'Cause findin' a good man, girls, is like findin' a


(Needle in a haystack)
What did I say, girls?
(Needle in a haystack)

I say you'd better take heed
(Needle in a haystack)
Listen to me
(Needle in a haystack)
(She-doop)


You'd better play hard to get
Or you're gonna regret
The day you were born, girl
When he leaves you alone, girl


Good guys are like findin' a
(Needle in a haystack)
Girls, they're like findin' a
(Needle in a haystack)
