A-well now, everybody's heard about the bird

About the bird, the bird, bird bird bird
(This line is backing sung throughout the song)
("Tweet tweet tweet" sung over backing)
Swingin' this dance now to hit the scene

It's got the latest groove & it's really clean
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
Come on, jump here & get on your knees

And get to flappin' your wings, in the west or the east
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird

Well, they're dancin' this bird in the east & the west
Make this dance & you'll look the best
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
