When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Baby


Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...alright


Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love

Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
Do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you


Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your lo-o-ove

Oh, I don't care how long it might take
Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Oh yea


Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

Girl, I've got some chocolate kisses for your loving; baby
Oh yea
Do you want some candy?
Do you want some honey suckle?
Do you want some chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you?

Girl, if you felt everything you heard me say
Turn your feelings in your heart back to me right away
And I'll get it


Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love to you

Do I do (do I do)
What you do (what you do)
When I do my love...Nate!
I know the record is about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you donâ€™t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha
...
...
Now everybody's talking about the jive is in...
Well I know I've got something for your body...
...
Cause I
Earl! Earl!
Earl's playing by himself, man!
Earl's playing by himself, man!
Earl's playing by himself, man!
Dennis playing by himself, man!
Five, four, three, two, one
