You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you?
Have you asked why
You seem to fall in love

Out again?
Do you ever really love or just pretend?
Why fool yourself?
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

Though you try
You can't hide all the things you really feel
This time decide
That you will open up
Let it in

There's no shame in sharing love
You keep within, so jump on in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late
Too late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

So jump on in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, love, love
