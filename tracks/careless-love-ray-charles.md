Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Now now don't you see what your careless love has done

Well you worried my mother till she died
And you caused my father to lose his mind
Now damn you I'm goin' to shoot you, Lord, I'm gonna shoot you both right down
I'm gonna spare no one of you child till you spin next dyin'

Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh Lord, don't you see what, what your careless love has done
Oh yeah

Careless love now don't know see how you follow me down
Careless love, don't you see how you follow me down
Well, you robbed me out of my silver, Lord, and out of my gold
Ever since you been a-ridin' by side

Oh love, oh love, oh careless
Oh love, yes oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, I said love, oh careless love now
Don't you see what your careless love has done, yeah
