Yeah, when I feel that music
Rockin' on my soul
Devil's got his hold on me,
I love that rock and roll.

Hey, hey, Music Eyes,
Play a tune for me
I'm lookin' for surprises,
Somethin' new to be
Send me your sweetest notes,
Send them through the night.
Like a good-time story,
It's just turning out all right.

Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.

Stay with me my friend,
You're all I really need
The song of a bird was heard,
Fallin' from a tree.
Though soft and warm, my eyes seem cold,
I feel a calling need.
I've aged enough to die now,
In a world more for you than me.

Mmm, yeah, love that rock and roll.
Mmm, yeah, love it, need some more.
Mmm, yeah, love that rock and roll.
Mmm, yeah, love it, need some more.

Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.

Hey, hey, Music Eyes,
