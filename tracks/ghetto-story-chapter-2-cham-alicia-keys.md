(Intro: Alicia Keys (Baby Cham))
Here's my, ghetto story (Story)
Been in hell through the fire, now, gonna take it higher (This a survival story, true ghetto story)
Here's my, ghetto story (Story)
So many reasons to sing now, plus now we got the keys to the kingdom (This is my story, real ghetto story, hey)

(Verse 1: Baby Cham)
I remember those days when Hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem tek me snow cone
An mek him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome
I remember when we run, Fatta get him knee blown
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the avenue tun inna warzone
An ,Mickey madda fly him out, cau she get a loan
But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known
Yesterday Mickey call me pan mi phone
Mi say Mickey.....

(Chorus: Baby Cham)
We get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah

(Alicia Keys (Baby Cham))
We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah)

(Verse 2: Alicia Keys) (Baby Cham)
I remember those days when, we was dead broke
And, I could barely find a, dollar for a token
Hop in the train just to get where I'm goin
Po Po's after me I'm runnin like I'm smokin
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin funny
I remember playin over needles in the street
Everywhere I go and there was some part of mr
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa)
Remember cryin sayin that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gotta be somebody
Say, mommy don't worry it's just you and me
But, one day we will get out of this misery (Hey!)

(Chorus: Baby Cham)
We get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah

(Alicia Keys (Baby Cham))
We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah)

(Bridge: Alicia Keys)
Here's my, ghetto story (Story)
Been in hell through the fire, now, gonna take it higher
Here's my, ghetto story (Story)
So many reasons to sing now, plus now we got the keys to the kingdom

(Verse 3: Baby Cham)
Jamaica get screw, tru greed an glutton
Politics manipulate and press yutes button
But we rich now ,so dem caan tell man notin
Cuz a we a mek Mama a nyaam Fish an Mutton..Ehhhh
Ova dehso mek mi tell unnu some'in...
Tru mi dey a foreign now a guy kill me cousin
An mi here sey TD deh dey but him sey he wasn't
Anytime mi fly down him a get bout dozen....Cause......

(Chorus: Baby Cham)
We get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah

(Alicia Keys (Baby Cham))
We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah)
