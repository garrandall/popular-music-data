There was a time 
When I thought I knew 
Everything about 
This great big world 
Until I met you 
Into my life 
Like a brand new sun 
Now I find my home 
Inside your eyes 
Wherever you are 
It's hard to say it 
Cause I hide things so good 
But you make me say it 
Like only you could 
I love you 
More than any man could ever say 
I need you 
Baby let me count the ways 
And I'll be here 
I believe in everything you do 
So how did I get by without you 
For the longest time 
Playing games of solitaire 
Taking my wine 
But now I'm with you baby 
And I can dream out loud 
You're as pretty as a picture 
And you make me so proud 
It's hard to say it 
Cause I hide things so good 
But you make me say it 
Like only you could 
I love you 
More than any words could ever say 
I need you 
Baby let me count the ways 
And I'll be here 
There's nothing in this world I couldn't do 
So how did I get by without you 
You love me 
Now I know that I'm the lucky guy 
You've got me 
And there's nowhere I can hide 
So I'll be here 
I believe that all my dreams came true 
So how did I get by without you 
In the morning light 
To see you wake up next to me 
It's a beautiful sight 
Now everything's alright 
Yeah 
I love you 
More than any words could ever say 
I need you 
Baby let me count the ways 
And I'll be here 
I believe in everything you do 
So how did I get by without you 
You love me 
Now I know that I'm the lucky guy 
You've got me 
And there's nowhere I can hide 
So I'll stay here 
I believe in everything you do 
So how did I get by without you 
How did I get by 
How did I get by without you in my world 
How did I get by without you as my girl 
You're beautiful 
Beautiful 
So how did I get by without you 
Without you 
Without you
