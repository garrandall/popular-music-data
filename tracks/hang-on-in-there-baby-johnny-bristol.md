Hang on in there, baby
Give me love tonight
Don't be afraid, baby, oh

You know we can't help but make it, oh my love
You know we can't help but make it
Now that we've caressed a kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait till we reach that sweet moment of surrender
Oh we'll hear the thunder roar, feel the lightning strike
At a point we'll both decide to meet at the same time tonight

Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible

Don't be afraid baby, oho
Sweet virgin of the world
You know we can't help but make it
'Cos there's true love between us girl
Hm! so let us touch that cloud
That everyone dreams of
Oh! we're almost there darling truly making love

Hang on in there baby, please don't let me down
Please don't destroy this new joy

What's that now baby, what's that you say
Something's eating at you
And it's hard to get away (hard to get away)
Oh don't fight it baby just open up the door
'Cos that's the key to the freedom
That we've both been working for
Let it go baby, let it go darling, oh
Right there, right there
Baby don't you move it don't you dare
Go baby let it go honey oh right there baby
Don't you move it anywhere

Give it a stand up now fashion
Give it a jump up
Give it a jam give it a pull
Give me a love, give me a little love

Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
Hang on in there now
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there, darling
Hang on in there baby
Hang on in there baby
Please don't let me down, hold it down
Please don't destroy this new joy
New joy we've found
New joy we've found
