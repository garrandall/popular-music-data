Let me get up in this bitch like "What's good, ho?"
Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good
Hold up let me get it right
I been contemplating life
I been grindin' on a fight
I been writin' on a flight
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood
Better act good and get smacked good
I'm just tryna live life
I'm just tryna get right
Anybody got advice
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody gotta vice
I leave 'em diminished
And I do not know if you know that I am so
Ahead of my time that my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished
The greatest alive and I been it now go on your business can I get a witness
Been smoking and drinking a little bit
This level's to the litness

Pull up with that new-new in the driveway
So fast I double park that bitch sideways
When it comes to life I do it my way
Smoked out 180 on the highway
Yeah I'm sitting shotgun
Gotta let my shorty drive
I'm so alive, leave that pussy crucified
It's just you and I
You know it's do or die
It's just you and I
Girl you know it's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
Do or die (Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
It's do or die (Everybody know that it's the reason)
This that right here do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)

Hold up wait a minute bring it right back
Mix that real with that turn up call it BoomTrap
I ain't heard no shit like this in so long
I don't know how this right here could go wrong
This is my theme song, me and my team song
I got millions in the bank because my dream strong
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on
I get my green on, yes I get my green on
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O
Like Woah, goddamn, yeah that boy he been on the low
About to blow, about to show
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em
I don't know 'em, no I don't know 'em
I don't know, I don't
I vibe with 'em, I ride with 'em
If they down with me you know I die with 'em

Pull up with that new-new in the driveway
So fast I double park that bitch sideways
When it comes to life I do it my way
Smoked out 180 on the highway
Yeah I'm sitting shotgun
Gotta let my shorty drive
I'm so alive, leave that pussy crucified
It's just you and I
You know it's do or die
It's just you and I
Girl you know it's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
Do or die (Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
It's do or die (Everybody know that it's the reason)
This that right here do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do or die (Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
