I hope the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you want to go
And if youâre faced with the choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkinâ âtil you find the window
If itâs cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything


My wish for you
Is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while youâre out there gettinâ where youâre gettinâ to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish

I hope you never look back but you never forget
All the ones who love you
And the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find Godâs grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything, yeah more than anything



This is my wish
I hope you know somebody loves you
May all your dreams stay big
