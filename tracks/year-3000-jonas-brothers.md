One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor


He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah


He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine


He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor


We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo


He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine


I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)


He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah


I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, oh


He said, I've been to the year 3000 (Yeah, yeah)
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, doing fine


He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine


He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine
