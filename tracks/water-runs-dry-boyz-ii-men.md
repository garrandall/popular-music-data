We don't even talk anymore
We don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say I love you no more
Cause sayin' how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people work things out
And some just don't know how to change


Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away


Let's don't wait till the water runs dry (No no baby)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by (We might watch our whole lives)
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

No, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, oh

Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistakes of our lives
Don't do it baby

No, oh
No, oh

Don't do it baby
No, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, oh

Don't do it baby
