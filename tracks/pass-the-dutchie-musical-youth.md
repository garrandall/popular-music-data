This generation
Rules the nation
With version

Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
 I say

Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance
It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance
(Jah know!)

It was a cool and lonely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel it cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)

Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance
It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance
(Jah know!)



So I stopped to find out what was going on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)

Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance
It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance
(Jah know!)

Cause me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass
Give me little music make me wind up me waist
Me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass
Give me little music make me wind up me waist, I say

Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance
It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance
(Jah know!)

You play it on the radio
A so me say, we a go hear it on the stereo
A so me know you a go play it on the disco
A so me say we a go hear it on the stereo

Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance
It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance
(Jah know!)

I say east, say west, say north and south
This is gonna really make us jump and shout
