We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying, saying, saying?


We can't go on together with suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds


So, if an old friend I know should finally say "Hello"
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears?
I'm crying, crying, crying


We can't go on together with suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds


Oh, let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Don't let a good thing die
'Cause honey, you know I've never lied to you
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying?
I'm caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you...
