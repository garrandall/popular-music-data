(Hitmaka)
(2 Chainz)

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it (Yeah)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (Used to it)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home I got used to it
Prayin' you make it home like you used to

I realize we could rule the world
I realize we could rule the world

Fell in love with a real one, that's a dedication (Wow)
Had 'em patiently waitin' for a revelation
Even when I ain't around, ain't no separation
Your skin's smooth, your eyes brown and you're far from basic
Then we go to different places with no suitcase (Wow)
But when we come back we got two cases (Two cases, yeah)
Right now I use love for a medication (Love)
Back in the day I'd shoot cupid with no hesitation
I got more than 40 acres for my reparation
Pussy on my navigation, that's my destination
Please don't ever tell on me, baby (Never tell)
That mean don't call 12 on me, baby (Don't call 12)
As long as the meal prepared for me baby (Prepared)
The meals I prepare, I share with you, baby (I'ma share)
Of course they gon' like this shit, look at me
Everybody ain't happy that look happy

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it (Yeah)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (Used to it)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home I got used to it
Prayin' you make it home like you used to

I realize we could rule the world
I realize we could rule the world

Why don't we ride 4 deep?
Roll so far we on E
She on E, she on me
Let's try that way, okay

Shawty came in walkin' like a model
Shape like a bottle
She know if she mess with me it's gon' be trouble
I'ma bust her bubble
I'ma always love her, mess up all the covers
Yeah

Watch me break it down like a foldin' chair
See me in them Chain Reactions, I got 40 pair
Sorry I ain't answer the phone, I was slappin' that
Late at night, A.M., said I was pullin' hair

Y'all know me, so low-key
All this ice on, I got cold feet
My shawty bad, she a trophy
She like to lay on me and call me cozy
Yeah

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it

I realize we could rule the world
I realize we could rule the world

(Skrrt)
Yeah
I'ma trap it out one way or another
Yeah
One thing about love
They say it's blind
No matter where you from, though
You gon' bump into it one day
True
