What's your name is it Jane
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?
It's just I tired of wasting my hours
Talking to trees and watching flowers grow
Watching birds chasing bees
Little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?


Don't misunderstand me
I'm just an old man with no place to go
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story a beautiful story
That you might not know Please don't go

Pardon me mister tree
I hope I didn't offend you before
You are my friend but I wanted much more
But now I'm back once again
Like always before
Watching birds chasing bees
Little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?
