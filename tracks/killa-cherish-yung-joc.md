'Yung Joc' 'Yeah' 'I don't think they're ready for this one'


Cherish, they make me wanna lose control
Yeah, shawty, owwwww!
In a wifebeater two-seater cruise control
Pull up and your girl might lose control
Dime play a circle with that duffle bag boy
Guaranteed they can't get enough of that boy


I saw him from a distance
Then I watched him make his way to the floor (floor, floor, floor)
He walked up to me slowly, whispers
And he says 'I know who you are' (are, are, are)
I wanna get to know you


I can tell he was a player
But he knows just how to make you lose control
Somehow I knew


Shawty is a killer
But I really want him
And I got to have him tonight
Straight heart breaker
But it really don't matter
'cause I really want him tonight


The way he licks his lips
I'm in an infatuated state of mind, mind (oh-yeah)
He's so hard to resist
I gotta tell you, baby boy is so fine (fine)
Just gotta have you (oh-yeah)






Oh it feels so wrong that it must, it must be right
And I'm so high, don't wanna come down
Just let me fly


Hey, hey Let me talk to them
My whips push buttons
No car keys man
Pop the top like a sardine can
We stay flooded like New Orleans man
Lebron can't stop I be ballin' man

you I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors
Got a big dick and big kahunas
I'm a pretty slick like Rick the Ruler
Keep one eye open and my hand on that bitch

I rock the Claudio my shades Giselle
I break hearts
The heart break 'em tell
I treat your chick like a pair of ones
Where sluts have one good time and fun
