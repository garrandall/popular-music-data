Impossible
Montana
Ooh impossible
You know what they said when I told 'em my boy coming home?
It's impossible (Haha)
Arm and Hammer
Tell the sun to leave the sky
Wavy Crockett
It's just impossible (It's impossible)
Coke Wave
Them Wavy Boys back, hah?
It's impossible
What they gon' do now?
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry (Hollywood)
It's just impossible (Yeah)
Get 'em, Max


I need a thousand dollar bag of that
Look, I took the game and put it right back where I had it at
Back up in the streets, fuck with me, I wasn't having that
I got that animal ambition
Back in the kitchen, back up in my habitat
Money start to gravitate
These niggas ain't pop up until I got a date, typical leeches
I'm on them beaches with peaches, see we just play in the sheets
Streets, let my brother layin' in peace
Makes you wonder how I could of turned out
Dark shades, permed out, eighteen and shermed out
Now I swerve out
Special shout to them bitches that held me back
I relied on the word of mouth, Hollywood
Baby pussy probably good, I don't really know
Got a couple lil' niggas, did a couple videos
Said she never really had shit, daddy was always higher
Listen, Sugar Mama, you're preaching to the choir
Seen his body on the flyers, since a kid I had the pride
Seven figures is cool, me and wifey 'bout to retire
Got the big house, don't put them niggas in the big house
Nothin' in my way, I got a clear route, Hollywood


Impossible (Hollywood)
Ooh impossible (Hollywood)
Hollywood (California)
Impossible (Holly-Hollywood)
Ooh impossible (Hol-Hol-Hollywood)


Hollywood, Momma look
All the prices and the sacrifices, now we got it good, Hollywood
Money root of evil, in Hollywood
Couple M's make you the Devil, I guess being broke gets you to heaven
Yeah I'm fleek from the socks, to the rooftops when I'm steppin' out
Broke have you point a MAC-11 to the reverend's mouth
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Bullets blast, niggas humble, first his 'vance was a bundle
Sun Tzu with the Art of War, Coke Wave part four
Porsche box, southpaw
Been ballin', outdoor
Militant, like the nation of Islam
Live Nation, ten milli', don't be silly, hottest in my city
Foundation under the committee
Hundred M's and the thirties and the forties, gunnin' for that billi'
From the block, hot sauce
Handlin' the rock
From the bottom to the top chart
Montana, Rockstar
Bulletproof suburban, like I'm Juliani
Duck a Rockefeller law, but 
, masturbating to the Forbes
Thirty six M's, thirty six strategies of war
Montana


Impossible (Hollywood)
Ooh impossible (Hollywood)
Hollywood (Hollywood)
Impossible (Hollywood)
Ooh impossible (Hol-Hol-Hollywood)
Impossible (Hollywood)


Hollywood, Hollywood (Hollywood)
Hollywood (Hollywood)
California (Welcome to California)
Hollywood, Hollywood
Welcome to California
