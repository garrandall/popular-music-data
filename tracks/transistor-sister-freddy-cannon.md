She's my transistor sister
Ah, with a radio on her arm
No one can resist her
'Cause she's loaded with a musical charm

It's Presley, Darin and U.S. Bonds
And it's Fats and Connie and Orbison
She's my transistor sister
Playin' her radio

Yeah, now early in the mornin' 'til late at night
She's in tune with the local DJs
Sings all the words to the latest hits
Right along with the records they play

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh, oh

She's my transistor sister
Boy, you've got to love her alot
The guys just can't resist her
Oh, with a 15,000 watt

If you got it right you get no static
The time and weather is automatic
My transistor sister
Playin' her radio

Yeah, now early in the mornin' 'til late at night
She's in tune with the local DJs
Sings all the words to the latest hits
Right along with the records they play

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
