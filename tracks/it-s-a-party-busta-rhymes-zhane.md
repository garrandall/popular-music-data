Hah hah hah hah, move it to the left

Oh hah yeah ohyes, kind of blessed yes

Oh yeah I'm so fly... yeah, yeah you so fly too girl

Word up word up... uhh, hah

UHH! Let me get down, do my thing
I always bring, shit that always make your ass swing
Holding down the fort while we keep shit tight
Hit you with that bang shit that keep you live all night
Makin moves strong while we keep rockin on
Now the object is survival son so get your hustle on
Bust two shots while I blow up the spot
I make it hot, till the jam is packed, to the parking lot, now
Me and my mans feel like we astronauts
Cause we so high from off that weed we got from new knots
Certified stimulation got me open wide
Before we slide to side we grab the stash out the ride
We on fire tonight, and the place is lookin steamy
Babygirl let me seek that gift that make your cake creamy uhh
Feel the heat circulatin through your body
Everytime the Flipmode click step inside the part, word is bond


Hah, right, word is bond


Uhh, hah, hah uh hah!

Hah hah hahhhh

Word is bond, yes I am

Ha ha ha

I got my mind made up, c'mon you can get it girl
Come with me if you really wit it girl
Back to my dungeon shack, where the party is it
Where I can tickle your nipples and your feminine fat
I checks for you baby whatchu gon do
There's a party at my crib designed just for me and you
Let me let my crew know we bout to break out
Flip, Star, Web, Dukwon Allah, and the Boy Scout
My man Black Missin, son whylin with the shorty flippin
Stackin papers, sippin bubbles good nigga livin
But anyway we bout to break out in my Lands
Pursuin our thoughts and executin all plans
The dope shit is that we both underestand
that it's a one night stand and you ain't even thinkin bout your man
Oh, OH! We bout to turn on the heat again
Don't you say a word until we finish partyin


Hah, word up, tonight is the niiight

Word up, a peace of mind

Hah, woo, a little wild

Hah, it's a party y'all, it's a party y'all, it's a party y'all

Yo, well anyway I'm back around my way
Keepin it live you know how we do each and every day
Rollin through thick with my girls Zhane
With the exclusive debut Hey Mr. DJ
Listen to me baybay
We put somethin together that's gon drive you crazy
Get from our your seat and stop actin lazy
Or get up out my party if you actin shady, baby baby, it's a aprty


Word up, let's get it on tonight
