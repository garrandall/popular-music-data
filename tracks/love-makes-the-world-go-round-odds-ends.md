A glimpse in time
From a photograph faded
Boyhood dreams discovered
Look it I made it
Along the way
Becoming crooked and hated
For my music
Was maybe part of what it took to create it
Old girl... Cold world
May have made me jaded
Drugs made me crazy...
But I stayed creative
When there was no heat
Pumpin from my radiators
That was my golden era
Sumthin like my 88 is
To all my shady neighbors
Gangsters and the mental patients
I was surrounded by
Thanks for the inspiration
Anxious intense and pacin
I wrote a dozen records
Risked everything I had
Like it wasn't reckless
For years I thought that I was happy
Doing drugs in excess
Sippin whiskey till the dawn
And drinking buds for breakfast
A new day is here
I'm through with the drugs
But I had a premonition it
Tell me do what you love

I ain't gotta tell you how to chase your dreams
If you got that fire burning just believe
And do what you love...
Do what you love and make the world go round, make the world go round
Just do what you love
Do what you love and make the world go round
Without the music it's gon all go down

I seen money come and go both
Success and some fame
I let failure
Put stress on my brain yeah
I been gassed up and slept on
And slept on the train
It's been years
I been etching my name
In this game... Where I kept on
The same steps when enemies came
Off the deep end and leave friends
On memory lane
Through the passage of the past
I was mastering my craft
As a street kid
I dreamed big and then it became
I spent my whole life
Chasin my art
Trying to beat the same odds
I had faced from the start
And even though my world was crumbling and breaking my heart
I put broken pieces together
Just to take em apart
What a path that I took
It's been an ill journey
And through it all
I got a passion that's still burning
It's hard to change
When they knew what you was
But anything is possible
When you do what you love

I ain't gotta tell you how to chase your dreams
If you got that fire burning just believe
And do what you love...
Do what you love and make the world go round, make the world go round
Just do what you love
Do what you love and make the world go round
Without the music it's gon all go down

What can I say
I got a new lease and Life is good
I got a future looking bright
Just like it should
Cause I been sober
Over a year today
And it only gets better
From here they say
I dropped the guilt I was
Carrying and taking uphill
And got a new piece of mind
They don't make in a pill
Plus I got rid of hatred
And the waking up Ill
Can it last I don't know
But I have faith that it will
And this morning
I awoke with the sunrise
And found the strength
And the hope in my sons eyes
Then all those knots
In my stomach they get untied
I used to have none
These are some skies
And this is some life
From here that we on now
I'm right back where I belong
In the booth with the mic and my truth
Tell you what it was
Time moves fast
And I'm just trying to do what I love

I ain't gotta tell you how to chase your dreams
If you got that fire burning just believe
And do what you love...
Do what you love and make the world go round, make the world go round
Just do what you love
Do what you love and make the world go round
Without the music it's gon all go down
