(Gravy!)
Bitch I got that frostbite
From that ice up on my pendant
I flew, to the hospital
And piped the flight attendant!
I needed that A+
So I fucked my superintendent!
And I don't pay no bills
Got honeys in all professions!
And it's, alright!
I hit it all night!
Serenade yo sister with the afternoon delight!
I'm the young Barbara Streisand
You should be my hype man
Cause I seen that picture of me on yo fucking night stand!

Gravy! Train!
Gravy with yo dame
You can't find yo bitch
Cause she on that Gravy Train

Gravy with yo dame, uh

I just want a thick bitch
That I can take on picnics
Even if that means that I gotta stay a mistress
Aye, I guess I must look delicious
Got yo bitch acting like the big bad wolf and I'm the piglet
(Gravy!)
Cause she keep on tryna blow me!
I got too much ice so I whip the zamboni
I be at the club with yo wife, and my homies
And she throwing all the ones from yo fucking alimony
(Gravy!)

Gravy! Train!
Gravy! Train!
Gravy! Train!
Gravy with yo dame
Bitch it's
Gravy! Train!
Gravy! Train!
Gravy! Train!
Gravy with yo dame, uh
