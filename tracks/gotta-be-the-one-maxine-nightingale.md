I can't love you
Baby anymore
I can't love you
Baby anymore
Gotta be the one to tell you
Gotta be the one to break this spell
That I've hooked you on
Oh, but I was wrong
Gotta be the one to see you cry
Gotta be the one to dry your eyes
And say goodbye and all those other lies

I can't love you
Baby anymore
I can't love you
Baby anymore
I was wrong
I thought it all along
Thought we'd get over it
But the pieces didn't seem to fit
And now here I am
Right down upon the floor
Just because

I can't love you
Baby anymore
I can't love you
Baby anymore
Gotta be the one to tell you
Gotta be the one to break this spell
That I've hooked you on
Oh, but I was wrong
Gotta be the one to see you cry
Gotta be the one to dry your eyes
And say goodbye and all those other lies

I can't love you
Baby anymore
I can't love you
Baby anymore
I can't love you
Baby anymore
And though it hurts me so
It's just that one of us must go
And now it's down to me
I've got to set you free
Just because
I can't love you
Baby anymore
Got to be the one...
