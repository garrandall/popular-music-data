I dont give a damn about the castle on the hill 
all the gold that we could eat, or the horse you had for sale 
No, I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive 

I dont give a damn if I'm running from the law 
when my money's not enough and they come and take it all 
No, I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive 

Have you heard the Mona Lisa? 
Have you heard who you are? 
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning 

Wanna be ok when I'm sitting here alone
Not just thinking of the ways that I could have done it wrong 
No, I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive 

Have you heard the Mona Lisa? 
Have you heard who you are? 
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning 
Now, you're a new morning now 

Have you heard my Mona Lisa? 
Have you heard who you are? 
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning 
Now, you're a new morning now
