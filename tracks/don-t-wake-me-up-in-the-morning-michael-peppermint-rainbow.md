Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
Not if you're planning to say goodbye
Don't touch my face in the morning, Michael
I might begin to cry


To see you walk out the door would be more than I can take
I wanna hide, please let me hide
As long as I sleep at least I can keep on dreaming that
You're by my side, right by my side


Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
Unless you want me  to die
Please stay with me in the morning, Michael
And hold me in the light


Your lips are so close to mine but the time is running out
And I'm afraid, I'm so afraid
I want you to be with me when the sun begins to warm
My window shade, oh God I pray


Don't wake me up, Michael


Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
Unless you love me enough to stay
I want you here in the morning, Michael
Please don't go away


(Don't wake me up) Don't wake me up
(Don't wake me up) Don't wake me up
(Don't wake me up) Don't wake me up

Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
I might begin to cry
Don't touch my face in the morning, Michael
I might begin to cry
Don't wake me up in the...
