The word is faithful, look it up 
It don't mean sneakin' around 
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough 
How 'bout forever, just look it up 
It means through thick and thin and 
Pitchin' in even when the times get tough 

The word is easy, look it up 
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash 
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck 
Let's try liar, just look it up 
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull 
You tell me when you come home drunk 
It's just like you to be so clueless 
Cause you never thought I'd do this 

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone 
The word is over 
Look it up 

You said you're sober, look it up 
It's right next to hell is freezin' over, flyin' pigs, 
And all that stuff 
And how bout baby, look it up 
It's what you call me and it's how you act 
Every time I call your bluff 
It's just like you to keep denyin' 
Save your whinin' and your cryin' 

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone 
The word is over 
Look it up 

The word's forgiveness, look it up 
It's what Jesus has in store for you 
But I don't no matter what 
Quit your beggin' and your prayin' 
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'? 

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone 
The word is over 
Look it up 

Asshole 

Just look it up, look it up
