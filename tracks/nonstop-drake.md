Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Look, I just flipped a switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doing this
Bodies start to drop, ayy, hit the floor
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot
Give me my respect, give me my respect
I just took it left like I'm ambidex
Bitch, I move through London with the eurostep
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause, I'm going, outta there, I'm gone
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack, servin' up a pack
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah I'm light skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgiving wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chiken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
(This a Rollie not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop)
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is-

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the Owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that's standard for me
Like I went blind dog you gotta hand it to me (gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went (They don't love you no more)
You don't wanna play with him (nah, nah, nah)
They'll be mourning you like 8AM (R.I.P)
Pinky ring till I get a wedding ring (woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy damn
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit, damn)
Either hand is the upper hand (oh, yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (oh, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion for real
They been trying me but I'm resilient for real
I can't go in public like civilian for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit man I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and man it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on I gotta represent

My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
(This a Rollie not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop)
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
From smokin' the chicken
The bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
(This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot)
