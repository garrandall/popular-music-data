That's how much
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
That's how much
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how much
I love you
(Yeah, I love you)

Pick a number from one to ten
Double it and add a million



Count the miles from here to Mars
Triple it and add a trillion



Although I'm not a mathematical genius
At least I know the score
Who cares how far to Venus
When you live right next door

Oh, count the pebbles on every beach
Triple it and add a trillion



Who cares how far to Venus
When you live right next door



Who cares how far to Venus
When you live right next door
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Right next door)

Count the pebbles on every beach
Triple it and add a trillion
