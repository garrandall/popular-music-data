Sperduto comm'a cane mmiez'в via
Chiagne stu core mio addulurato
Smuуvete pure tu, Madonna mia
Pecchй na 'nfama sulo mm'ha lassato
Vurrнa murн sу troppo surfurtunata

Mme pare d'a vedй cu 'o manto 'e sposa
Cua vesta janca e 'a faccia culor rosa
Se 'mmeretava, quann'essa и spusata
Na botta ф core chella scellerata

Oh, mama, why am I so all alone
Why is there no one I can call my own
Why do the days and nights all seem the same
Why don't you answer when I call your name
Oh, will I ever want to live again

You were my sun, my first, my guiding light
You were the one who taught me wrong from right
So much of you is with me though you're gone
Angela mia, how can I go on

Senza mamma 'e 'nnammurate
