The ever winding stream
The ever blowing breeze
The ever shining stars
Over the ever growing trees
Those drifting clouds above us (clouds above us)
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)

The ever whispering wind (the ever whispering wind)
The ever rolling sea (the ever rolling sea)
The shifting desert sand
Under the sun eternally
That endless sky high above (sky high above)
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)

My life was so wrong
Till you came along
And then with one kiss
You changed all the sadness
To joy and pleasure

So let the hands of time (so let the hands of time)
Keep ticking as they do (keep ticking as they do)
They'll only find that I'm
That I'm still side by side with you
As long as there's a heaven above (heaven above)
Never will outlive (never will outlive)
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)
