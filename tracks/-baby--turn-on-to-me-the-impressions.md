Baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me
Baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me

Which way do I go
How can I let her go
If she leaves me I follow
That's how much I love her so

Turn on to me, turn on
I'm such a fool
Just about to lose my cool
Now when I?
My mind is all gone, nothin' in it
So baby, turn on...
Woooh

Baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me
Baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me

I need her so bad
And I'm so helpless
If she just open her mind, mind
There's no telllin' just what she might find

Turn on to me, turn on

I'm such a fool
I'm just about to lose my cool
Now when I?
My mind is all gone, nothin' in it

So baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me
Baby, turn on...
Baby, turn on to me
...
