Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate, mmh
Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate, mmh
Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate, mmh
Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate


Shit, me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake
I bought me a Benz, it came with a shank
I fuck on your friends, I fuck on your bae
Every time I pretend, it came with a bait (Uh-huh)
I was in a Royce, I was seeing space
'Bouta fuck a bitch brain, my DM's late
Bitch, you ain't my sensei
You could use my nut to cleanse your face


Bitch, drink my nut like E&J
I was fucked up bro, had to reinstate (Uh-huh)
Look and see I'm straight
We sexin', we ain't got a birthday cake (Uh-huh)
Gotta keep an AK
These niggas play games like arcade (Uh-huh)
Pull up in a Porsche
See you're unloyal, had to part ways (Uh-huh)


I drip on my dawg's stage
I brought this shit down at the Barclays (Uh-huh)
I fucked her at Ross place
I ran it up, fillin' my dawg's safe (Uh-huh)

Cashed out on some dog, yay
You niggas was taught to follow the way (Uh-huh)
I blocked a thot today
Stop blowing up my number and stalkin' my page (Uh-huh)

I got a thot, uh, I got a thot, hey
If I leave the spot, I go to the yacht, hey

New Gucci stocks, cover her twat, hey
Givenchy socks, dress up the spot, hey

Jeepers creepers, the gators got measles, shit
I fucked up the bank, bought a rose gold shank, yeah

No realer than this
Dunk with the assist, we hit us a lick (Lick)
Slime in that bitch
I went and got rich, my necklace glist' (Yeah)

Two hundred a fist
One hundred my bitch, I'm real as it get (Uh huh)
Talkin' that shit, I hope your kids still humped all your kids

They hit up my mans
They caught him down bad, I want some revenge
I ran up them M's
Need cash in my bank or pull up in a Brinks


Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake
Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake

We done made a few M's and I'm straight
Got me a mil', it fit my plate

Shit, the teeth on plastic plate
Just 'cause I listen don't mean I debate, uh
I don't got no time to be late
I done missed a few mils, got some buried in the lake

Hey, constantly dodging the grave
The world is a cage, the Planet of Apes (Planet)
Gotta keep the family straight
We know what it takes, the slimiest snakes, uh
I done ran up a whole mil'
I'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh
Got racks all inside the safe
If I run out of space, stay booked out of state


Top off the Benz, the one with no space
It's drivin' itself, hit the gas and the brakes
I had her bent inside of the Wraith
The size, the tint, the curtain, the weight
I had to sprint all way to the end
I lost some old friends, couldn't keep up the pace
Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face

The jet that I'm on, its muzzle got Wraith
I'm dodging the rain and I'm dodging the hate
I don't need a pass 'cause I'm not in school
You playin', you gon' be another cold case

My diamonds gon' dance, they come and enhance
My dick in her hand, I bet it get ate
I spent sixty bands on one of my cases
The paperwork in, my co-D is safe

YSL, we the guys
We murder him and his tribe
I show you around like a spy
This city is mine 'til I die, ah

Patek the rock, ah
Soon up, we shoot at your spot, ah
Perfectly aim for the top, ah
Fuckin' your ho 'til she tired, yeah

Yeah, just look at these rocks, uh
Lil' mama got top, it's wet as a mop, whoa
I creep in the spot
It's knot knots on me on the way out

Got too many vibes
She feelin' my brother, we swiggity-swap (Thugger)
Keep sendin' him Dots
I'm gon' free my cousin, I won't let him rot

You sent me a dyke
I fucked her so good, I got her back right
It's locked, and she got Suge jaws
But I never want the key to the heart, nah
She say my music art
And love it when I'm rappin' with a guitar
We really came from the A
My shit flowin', havin' plenty of bars


Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake
Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake

We done made a few M's and I'm straight
Got me a mil', it fit my plate

Shit, the teeth on plastic plate
Just 'cause I listen don't mean I debate, uh
I don't got no time to be late
I done missed a few mils, got some buried in the lake

Hey, constantly dodging the grave
The world is a cage, the Planet of Apes (Planet)
Gotta keep the family straight
We know what it takes, the slimiest snakes, uh
I done ran up a whole mil'
I'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh
Got racks all inside the safe
If I run out of space, stay booked out of state


Aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate, mmh (Aimin' at a gate)
Aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate (Aimin' at a gate, mmh)
(Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate, mmh
Aimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate)
