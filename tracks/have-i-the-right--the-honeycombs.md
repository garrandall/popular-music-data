Have I the right to hold you? You know I've always told you
That we must never ever part oh oh oh oh
Have I the right to kiss you? You know I'll always miss you
I've loved you from the very start
Come right back I just can't bear it
I've got this love and I long to share it
Come right back I'll show my love is strong
Have I the right to touch you? If I could you'd see how much you
Send those shivers running down my spine. Oh Oh
Have I the right to thrill you? You know I'll wait until you
Give me the right to make you mine.
Well, Come right back I just can't bear it
I've got this love and I long to share it
Come right back I'll show my love is strong. Oh yeah.
