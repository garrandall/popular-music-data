Yes, sir..
Yes, sir..
Yes, sir..
Yes, sir..


I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rolling down 95 (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm looking for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)
Then dammit, I'll beat it up (Yes, sir)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)


Don't know why but the ladies call me Baby Blue
The sticker, they take me and rape me
And make me their victim
I leave 'em, the freaks
But if they married, I stick 'em
And if they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunning through the city trying find a lady who's beautiful
But she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue don't let you do what you wanna do
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami
Busting you like a tummy
I'm ahead of my class
Getting head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag
See Benjamin's head on the cash


I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rolling down 95 (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm looking for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)
Then dammit, I'll beat it up (Yes, sir)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)


Yeah
Top down
Blue star tag
Ol' master bear skin rugs in the jag
Spectac wit the back chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a everlast punching bag
Hotter than a Bisquik biscuit out the oven
Yo babymama go on missions to get this loving
We kissing and hugging
She never picked the phone up
You be looking for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get back to back orgasms
Yes, sir the game is off the map
You give it to them one time and they come back like addicts


I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rolling down (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm looking for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)
Then dammit, I'll beat it up (Yes, sir)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)


Well let me step up in this thang
Right, lookin, smelling good
Looking good, smack it baby
Pure pleasureful (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top
Pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda, a bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside
Met up wit my homeboys
Fake guys, fake girl, leave me alone boy
Plus the Cadi looking good enought to eat
You can tell by the way the girls acting across the street
But on the other hand, Alfapha just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the park
Baby lets go
The block was thick no questions asked
So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here girl


I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rolling down (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm looking for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)
Then dammit, I'll beat it up (Yes, sir)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
My body
Yo body (body's burning up)
