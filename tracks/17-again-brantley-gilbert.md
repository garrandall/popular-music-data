There ain't nothing like 'em first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights, homecomin' dances
Givin' my old letterman's jacket away
To old what's her name

But now it's you and me talking on the phone 'til 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we've still got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again

I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
Girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she ain't got nothin' on you tonight

Cause you're like a summer love that don't come and go
Never have to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like a first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we've still got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again

Lookin back I wish I could put you inside every memory
(Every memory)
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
And climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we've still got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Yeah just like we're 17 again

17 Again
Oh
