Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me,
Town to get me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy


Well, I talk about it,
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it

Talk about, 
Talk about,
Talk about moving,

Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on


oh, oh, yeah

Won't you take me to,
Funkytown? 


Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me,
Town to get me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy.


Well, I talk about it,
Talk about it
Talk about it
Talk about it

Talk about, Talk about,
Talk about moving,

Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on


oh, oh, yeah

Won't you take me to,
Funkytown

Come on everybody,
shake it up and down,
lets get up, party on,
in the Funkytown,
put your hands up high,
now take it down low,
come on party people it's time to go!


oh, oh, yeah

Won't you take me to,
Funkytown?
