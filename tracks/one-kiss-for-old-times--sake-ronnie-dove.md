CHORUS
One kiss for old times' sake
Just like it used to be
One kiss for old times' sake
Could bring you back to me

If you'd give me a chance
To love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours
Could change your mind

And you would know how much I want, I need you, I lo-o-o-o-ove you?
Oh, my darlin', please grant me this

CHORUS

If there's a spark of love
Still left from our romance
You owe it to your heart
To give me one more chance

Oh, can't you see how much I want, I need you, I lo-o-o-o-ove you?
Oh, my darlin', please grant me this

CHORUS
(One kiss for old times' sake)
