I remember back a long time ago
In the days of my childhood
In the evenin' when the sun's sinkin' low
Walkin' in the wildwood

Skippin' and trippin' through the flowers
We'd go hand-in-hand
Lookin' back on all the happy hours
Anybody could understand

You and me, babe
Just got to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together now, yeah
Oh yeah

You and I didn't have a lot of friends
Didn't have too much to say
So they never did let us join in
All the games that they used to play

Seem like it was only yesterday
Down at Lincoln Junior High
I remember what the kids used to say
As we'd go strollin' by

You and me, now
Sure 'nuff, tryin' to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together, now

Time goes rollin' by
And they say that you and I
Will go our sep'rate ways
But birds of a feather
Will always be together
Sure 'nuff, now

Your folks didn't want me hangin' 'round
Said that I was bad to you
So we'd meet on the other side of town
Down a long, dark avenue

But they can't keep the two of us apart
Long as you really love me
I got the feelin' way down in my heart
And that's the way that it should be

You and me, babe
Sure 'nuff got to be, now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather

Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
We got to be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
