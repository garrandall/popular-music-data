Somewhere out in the back of your mind (Somewhere)
Comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light
She had trusted many...
But been unfamiliar with...
Almost everyone but you

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you

She had trusted many...
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles...
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried... and she tried to taunt him
And he hated to be separated...
From that picture... No...

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Oh, well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
Well I have known this much longer than I've known you

Long nets of white cloud my memory...
Long nets of white cloud my memory...
Oh... there is magic... all around you...
Everytime you walk in the room

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
Well I have known this much longer than I've known you...
