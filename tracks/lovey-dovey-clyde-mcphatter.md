Well, you're the cutest thing
That I did ever see
I really love you, baby
Won't you come with me

Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh, no

Every time you kiss me
You just thrill me so
Never, never, never
Never let me go

Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey all the time, uh uh
Oh, baby, I can't get you
Out of my mind, oh, no

I cry with feeling
When you're near me
I'm high as a ceiling
Oh, baby, hear me

'Cause I'm thinking I love
Place none above you

Come here, pretty baby

I can't wait because
My love is coming down
I feel the mood for you
For you, pretty babe
I'd break mama's rule

Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey all the time, oh, yeah
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind

I never knew the thrill or ecstacy
So tell me that it's gonna be
Just you and me

Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey all the time, uh huh
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
No, no, no...
