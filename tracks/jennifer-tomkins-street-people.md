Jennifer Tomkins was born on a Sunday
Her daddy got drunk and left home on a Monday
Her mother she died young, when Jenny was seven
And Jennifer Tomkins went to work at eleven

Oh, I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere
Oh Lord, come on down
Got to spread some love around

I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere
Oh Lord, come on down
Got to spread some love around

Jenny, she grew up to be quite a lady
And then she met Tony, whose background was shady
She gave him her love, but just like her mother
He left her one day and ran off with another

Oh, I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere
Oh Lord, come on down
Got to spread some love around

Oh Lord, come on down
Got to spread some love around
Look, look, everywhere
Ain't no one that seems to care

I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere
Oh Lord, come on down
Got to spread some love around

Oh Lord, come on down
Ain't no love that can be found
I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere

Oh Lord, come on down
Ain't no love that can be found
I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere

Oh Lord, come on down
Ain't no love that can be found
I swear, just ain't fair
Trouble, trouble everywhere
