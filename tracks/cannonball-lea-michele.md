Break down
Break down

Break down
I was scared to death, I was losing my mind
Break down
I couldnât close my eyes, I was pacing all night
But now I think I found a light at the end of the tunnel
I had my doubts, couldnât find the truth I was going under

But I wonât hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I've got this new beginning and I will fly
Iâll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
Iâll fly, Iâll fly, Iâll fly like a cannonball

Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and pain and I live for the rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again

But I wonât hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I've got this new beginning and I will fly,
Iâll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
Iâll fly, Iâll fly, Iâll fly like a cannonball

Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I gotta get out into the world again

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
Iâll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
Iâll fly, Iâll fly, Iâll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
Iâll fly, Iâll fly, Iâll fly like a cannonball
