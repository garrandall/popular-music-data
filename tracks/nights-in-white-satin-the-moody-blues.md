Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty
I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

'Cos I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going
Through they
Can't understand
Some try to tell me
Thoughts
They cannot defend
Just what you
Want to be
You will be
In the end

And I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you

Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty
I've always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

'Cos I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you
'Cos I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you

Breath deep
The gathering gloom
Watch lights fade
From every room
Bedsitter people
Look back and lament
Another day's useless
Energy spent

Impassioned lovers
Wrestle as one
Lonely man
Cries for love
And has none
New mother picks up
And suckles her son
Senior citizens
Wish they were young

Cold hearted orb
That rules the night
Removes the colours
From our sight
Red is gray and
Yellow white
But we decide
Which is right
And which
Is an illusion
