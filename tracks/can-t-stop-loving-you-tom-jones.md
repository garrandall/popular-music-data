I cant turn you loose now
If I do I'm gonna loose my life
I can't turn you loose now

If I do I'm gonna loose my life
I can't turn you loose to nobody
I love you baby, yes I do
Give shakin' mama, I told ya
I'm in love with only you
Baby do it baby why don't ya
I'll give ya everything you want

Gotta, gotta

Keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose
I can't turn you loose
Gotta gotta keep on holdin' on

I can't turn you loose now
I'm in love with the prettiest thing
I never, never turn you loose now
Because of all the sweet love she brings

I can't turn you loose to nobody
I love you baby, yes I do
Give shaking mama,
I told ya I'm in love with only you
Gotta, do it baby why don't ya
I'll give ya everything you want

Gotta gotta
Keep on holdin' on

Never gonna turn you loose
I can't turn you loose
Gotta keep a grip on you
Gotta gotta keep on holdin' on

(I know you think I'm gonna stop now
But we ain't gonna stop it now
One more time)

Gotta gotta

Keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose
I can't turn you loose
Gotta gotta keep on holdin' on

Gotta gotta
Keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose
I can't turn you loose

Gotta gotta keep on holdin' on

Everybody want it
Everybody can have it
Gotta, gotta gotta, gotta
Oo, soo hold on,
I'm comin
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Get a grip

Can't turn you loose
Hold on, I'm comin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Get a grip
Can't turn you loose
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Gotta get a grip on you baby
Gotta, gotta gotta

Gotta, gotta gotta
We're groovin', groovin'

Gotta gotta
Keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose
I can't turn you loose
Gotta gotta
Keep on holdin' on

Gotta get a grip
Can't turn you loose
