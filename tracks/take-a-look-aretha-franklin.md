Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself
But don’t you look too close
‘Cause you just might see
The person that you hate the most
Lord, what’s happening to this human race?
I can’t even see one friendly face
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies
Just take a look at your children born innocent
Every boy and every girl
Denying themselves a real chance
To build a better world
Dear Lord, dear Lord
What’s happening to your precious dream?
It’s washing away on a bloody bloody stream
Take a look at your children before it’s too late
And tell them nobody wins when the prize is hate
