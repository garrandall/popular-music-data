Mystery surrounds me and I wonder where I'm going
There's a cloud above me and it seems to hide the way
I'm going straight ahead 'cause it's the only way I know
I wanna leave the past and live just for today

Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed

Sittin' in the gutter with my head wrapped in my hands
I've been drinkin' all night and I just can't stand the pain
It took an awful lot of trouble just to make me understand
Now it's clear to me but will it ever be the same

Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed

Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed

Head upon the highway just as fast as I could go
I rode through the night and halfway through the day
I had no direction, I didn't even want to know where I was going
The only thing I knew was that I had to get away

Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed

Tell me, baby, tell me, baby, tell me, baby, do you need my love
Now that I'm here, yeah, do you need, do you need my love
