Every night when I'm all alone
All I do is call you on the phone
It rings, ting a ling
And this is what we do

Oh, well, we're kissing on the phone
Oh, oh kissing on the phone
Oh, oh when we're all alone
All were doing is
Kissing on the phone

Every kiss is a kiss of fire
I'm so afraid that
We're burning the wire
Oh, gee, baby, what you do to me

When we're kissing on the phone
Oh, oh kissing on the phone
Oh, oh when we're all alone
All were doing is
Kissing on the phone

(Hear it, ting a ling)

Oh, well, we're kissing on the phone
Oh, oh kissing on the phone
Oh, oh when we're all alone
All were doing, we're
Kissing on the phone

(Oh gee, baby)

When we are kissing on the phone
Oh, oh kissing on the phone
Oh, oh when we're all alone
All we're doing is
Kissing on the phone

(Kissing on the phone)
When were all alone
(Kissing on the phone)
When were all alone
