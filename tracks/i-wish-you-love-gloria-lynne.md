Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring to give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
