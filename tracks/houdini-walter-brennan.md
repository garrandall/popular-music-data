Now I used to be like a lot of folks
Just to seeing how much money I could make
But lately, I'm spending most of my time
Fishing for that old wide mouth bass in the lake

I call him Houdini, the way he disappears
Just when you think he's taking your line
He's been outsmarting folks
Around here for years
But one day, he's gonna be mine

He brought a lotta fishermen
Down here to our town
Eager to try out a new lure
They's thinking they's
The best anywhere's around
And going away not so sure

So, with your reputation, old big mouth
Fishing for you's considered
Worthwhile for folk
So, I ain't in no hurry to pull you out
Sitting here neath this old oak

So, swim Houdini
Whilst I close my eyes
Cause you and me's friends
Now you ain't no fool
And neither am I and one day
I might pull you in

Now, I figured out how you survive
Watch the others get tempted
And caught, you see
You're not greedy so you're still alive
Old fish, that's a lesson you've
Taught to me

Well, Houdini, the sun's getting low
I know you like to jump in the lake
So, I'll just mosey along
Tomorrow, I might even use a little bait

So, swim Houdini
Whilst I close my eyes
Cause you and me's friends
Now you ain't no fool
And neither am I and one day
I might pull you in

No, you ain't no fool
And neither am I and one day
I might pull you in
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
