You to me
Are sweet as roses in the morning
And you to me
Are soft as summer rain at dawn, in love we share
That something rare

The sidewalks in the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begins to crumble
But love will never die
Because we'll see the mountains tumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be In love eternally That's the way
That's the way it's meant to be

All around, I see the purple shades of evening
And on the ground
The shadows fall and once again you're in my arms
So tenderly
The sidewalks in the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begins to crumble
But love will never die
Because we'll see the mountains tumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be In love eternally
That's the way
That's the way it's meant to be

The sidewalks in the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begins to crumble
But love will never die
Because we'll see the mountains tumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be In love eternally
That's the way
That's the way it's meant to be
That's the way
That's the way
That's the way it's meant to be
That's the way
That's the way it's meant to be
