Oh honey you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare


And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya, crying for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do



Now, what we gonna do right here
Is we gonna smooth it out
C'mon

Oh oh honey got me hooked on you

MC
And she won't stop
