I hear the music coming out of your radio
Are you there with another girl instead of me?
I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another girl instead of me?

I'm standing on your doorstep and I don't know what to do
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away?
My friends all say that you were never true
Hiding in the shadows

I see two silhouettes on the back of your window shade
Are you there with another girl when I am gone?
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another girl, I can't go on

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So, if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith, but
I hear the music coming out of your radio

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you, worry so about you
Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith, but
I hear the music coming out of your radio

Hmmm, yeah, I hear the music
Coming out of your radio
The sweet, sweet music
And you're there with another girl
I hear the music
I don't wanna know
