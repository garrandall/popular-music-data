You see this girl, this girl's in love with you
Yes I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell
We know each other very well
How can I show you, you know I'm glad
I got to know you
'Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine

Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking,
Don't you let my heart keep breaking
'Cause I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die

Tell me now, is it so, don't you let me be the last to know
I said my hands, my hands are shaking,
Oh please don't let my heart keep waiting
'Cause I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die
