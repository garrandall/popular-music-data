Yo, sing this shit, are y'all fuckin' dumb?
Eternal Atake
Gotta shoot two at her
Gotta shoot two at her
Blue cheddar

That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better (Let's go)
Are you serious?
I swear my money is serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it
She sucked my dick till she get delirious
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it
Okay Port, but I'm not talking New (Let's go)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, uh (Damn)

I'm on some whole other shit
I got a whole 'nother rich
I'm on a new level
I was fuckin' on your bitch
She was ridin' on my dick
She ain't need two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches
I swear they all gonna snitch when my niggas gon' shoot at 'em
Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that about that but it's only if you let 'em
She saved my name in her phone
Only thing she saved me under is prolly the "U" letter
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is prolly ,um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone
Man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got 50s on me, I call that shit loose cheddar
Jeremy Scott's all on my feet
I had a cougar with me so I call that girl Coretta
I am the richest nigga in my city
I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather
I know that girl, she got swag
But when it come to putting it together, she could do better
I sent that girl a DM
She ain't answer me, so you know that I gotta shoot two at her, yeah

Gotta shoot two at her, yeah
and you are Little Uzi?
I, gotta shoot two at her
(Vert, let's go)
I, stay with the blue cheddar, whoa

That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better (Let's go)
Are you serious?
I swear my money is serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it
She sucked my dick till she get delirious
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it
Okay Port, but I'm not talking New
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, whoa (Move that pussy)

They try to cut me down
When they say I'm too low (you turn me up)
I said turn me up, I cannot hear my flow, whoa
I ain't never been no fool
Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules
I'ma take the dub, I'ma win
I ain't ever been no type that lose
Born like this, I ain't did no study
Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry
If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me
Talk 'bout the bag, the moula, the guap
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm running
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop
I'm running through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Whoa, stop that
Told a fuck nigga just drop that
If he shoot first, we gon' pop back
Margiela on me, lil' nigga, that's not that
What you got on?
Prada sweatsuit made of nylon
See my righteous girl, yeah, she says, "Right on"
When I hit that girl right with the light on
When I hit that girl, oh

Gotta shoot two at her
I gotta shoot two at her, whoa
I stay with the blue cheddar (Let's go)

That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better
Are you serious?
I swear my money is serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it
She sucked my dick till she get delirious
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it
Okay Port, but I'm not talking New
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, whoa

Lil Uzi Vert
Doot-doola-doot-doo
Doot-doo!
Thank you, Lil Uzi Vert leaves
Supposed to be standing still right now, ready, set, go
