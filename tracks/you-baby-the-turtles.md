From the time I fall asleep
'Til the mornin' comes I dream about
You, baby
And I feel alright
'Cause I know tonight I'll be with
You, baby
And who makes me feel like smilin'
When the weary day is through?

(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)

They say candy is sweet
But it just can't compete with
You, baby
You've got everything I need
And nobody can please like
You do, baby
And who believes all my wildest dreams
And my craziest schemes will come true?

(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)

A little ray of sunshine
A little bit of soul
Add just a touch of magic
You got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll

(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
