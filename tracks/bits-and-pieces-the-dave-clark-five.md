(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
Since you left me and you said goodbye
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
All I do is sit and cry
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
You went away and left me misery
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
And that's the way it'll always be

(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
You said you loved me and you'd always be mine
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
And we'd be together till the end of time
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
Now you say it was just a game
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
Well all you're doin' is leavin' me pain

Time goes by, it goes so slow, oh yeah
Till you start to see it to
Only just a few days ago
You said you loved me and it made me blue

(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
Now you're gone and I'm all alone
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
You're still way up there on your throne
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
Nothin' seems to ever go right
(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)
'Cause night is day and day is night
