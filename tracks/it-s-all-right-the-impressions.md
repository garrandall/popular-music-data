Say it's all right (It's all right)
Say it's all right (It's all right)
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right


We're gonna move it slow
When lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more
And it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Now listen to the beat
Kinda pat your feet
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, whoa, it's all right


When you wake up early in the morning
Feelin' sad like so many of us do
Hum a little soul, make life your goal
And surely something's got to come to you


And say it's all right
Say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right


Now everybody clap your hands
Give yourself a chance
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, whoa, it's all right


Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Then my woes got to go
And my love, she will know
From morning, noon and night


And she's got to say it's all right
Say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right


Everybody clap your hands
Now give yourselves a chance
You got soul now, baby
