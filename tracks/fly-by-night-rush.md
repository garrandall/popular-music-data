Airport scurry flurry faces
Parade of passers by
People going many places
With a smile or just a sigh
Waiting waiting pass the time
Another cigarette
Get in line - gate thirty-nine
The time is not here yet (end)


Why try? I know why
This feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
Clear head, new life ahead
It's time I was king now not just one more pawn


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend


Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend, whoa!


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend


Start a new chapter, find what I'm after
It's changing every day
The change of a season's enough of a reason
To want to get away
Quiet and pensive, my thoughts apprehensive
The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland playing a lone hand
My life begins today


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
