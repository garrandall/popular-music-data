Ooh there's something about
Just something about the way she move
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her.

Said ooh it's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you
Hey I can't figure it out
There's something about her

'Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kind of girl I need

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent

Ooh there's something about
The kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her

Something oh so sexy about
The kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it she got it no doubt,
There's something about her

'Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and a crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And the bills are paid on time
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent

Her favorite thing to say: "Don't worry. I got it."
And everything she got best believe she bought it
She gon' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it
Girl, you're everything I need,
Said you're everything I need

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent

Miss Independent
That's why I love her
