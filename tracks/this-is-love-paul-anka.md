We had been friends for a year and a day
Always around for each other
When I got lost you remembered the way
We were like sister and brother
But last night was wine
Together till dawn
And something entirely different was born

This is it
This is love, unlike ever before
I can't work, I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Acting like a mad hatter
But nothing's the matter, it's love

We helped each other through sad love affairs
Turning the tears into laughter
Ev'ryone said that our friendship was rare
Not even we saw all the love that was there

But last night was wine
Together \till dawn
And something incredibly wond'rous was born

This is it
This is love, unlike ever before
I can't work, I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Acting like a mad hatter
But nothing's the matter, it's love

I'm running in circles I'm walking on clouds
Gonna open the window and shout it out loud

This is it
This is love, unlike ever before
I can't work, I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Acting like a mad hatter
But nothing's the matter, it's love
