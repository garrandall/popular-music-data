I watch with open eyes
Till it's time
To take it all the way, hey

Everyday
The game is ours to play
Oh, tell me why
There are no alibis

'Cause winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end

Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
Hey

Hey
You listen when I say
There's a dream
Oh, that's comin' true today, yeah

Never turn away
When the challenge is alive
The choice is yours to make
In every chance you take

'Cause the winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end

Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top

First the mind
Then the soul
And when the heart
Gets pumped up for the goal

There's no defeat
You'd sooner die
It's man to man
As we stand eye to eye

Oh, winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end

Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top

Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end

Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top

Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end
