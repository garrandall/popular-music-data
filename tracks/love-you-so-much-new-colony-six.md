Hear this praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of You the praises start
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much

Lord, I love You, my soul sings
In Your presence carried on Your wings
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much

How my soul longs for you
Longs to worship You forever
In Your power and majesty
Lift my hands, lift my heart
Lift my voice towards the heavens
For You are my sun and shield

Hear this praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of You the praises start
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much

Lord, I love You, my soul sings
In Your presence, carried on Your wings
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much

How my soul longs for you
Longs to worship You forever
In Your power and majesty
Lift my hands, lift my heart
Lift my voice towards the heavens
For You are my sun and shield

How my soul longs for you
It longs to worship You forever
In Your power and majesty
Lift my hands, lift my heart
Lift my voice towards the heavens
For You are my sun and shield

Hear this praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of You the praises start
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much
I Love You so much, Jesus
I Love You so much
