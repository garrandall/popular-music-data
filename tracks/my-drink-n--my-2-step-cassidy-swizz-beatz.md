On... on... on...
HEYYYYYY~!


I got my drink and my two step, my drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step, my drink and my two step
It's on! It's on, it's on (and I'm home)
(Get the Patron and tell 'em that it's on)
I got my drink and my two step, my drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step, my drink and my two step
It's on! It's on, it's on (and I'm home)
(Get the Patron and TELL 'EM THAT IT'S ON)


I got my drink and my dutchie, I just beat a murder
People think that I'm lucky, my link lookin husky
Big stones, it's on, it's on, the kid home
Get the Patron, and tell 'em that it's on
Put the smoke in the air and get stoned
The whip sittin on two-sixes, the lip's chromed
My money used to be immature now my shit grown
Big wheels, big homes, I'm doin it big homes
(Now it's on! It's on, it's on) the kid home
Get the Patron, and tell 'em that it's on
I do my two step, and let the link swing
Hold the drink with the left hand to show the pink' ring




Aiyyo they wanna be like me, recreate my flow
Imitate my flow, then relate my flow
But while they try an' take my flow I make my dough
Aiyyo I can make it rain cause I be makin it snow
But yo, I've been takin it slow, I wasn't around
But the car crash couldn't lay the hustler down, nah
I'm still here f'real I'm still here
It wasn't lookin pretty but Swizzy I'm still here
They said I coulda been braindead in a wheelchair
But I'm standin in the booth and the skills are still here
Yeah, the hustler home, the hustler home
Let's celebrate a toast with a cup of Patron

Yeah yeah put your dutch in the air
Smoke haze, let the smoke raise up in the air
You mighta seen me in the 'ghini at a couple affairs
The engine in the trunk, the doors go up in the air
Yeah, and I be gone for a couple of years
I done sweat, I done bled, shed a couple of tears
I ain't stressin, it's a blessin that the hustler here
Let's celebrate a toast, put your cup in the air
YEAH~!
