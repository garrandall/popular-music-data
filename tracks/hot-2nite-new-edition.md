Ohhh (yeah)
All right
Hey
NE keep it hot for y'all

Now let me set it off in the right way
You got a bangin booty and a tight waist
I've been a fan since I met you in the labay
And hopefully you'll end up over my place
I can't believe I never saw you coming over
Until you put your pretty hand up on my shoulder
I wanna touch, I wanna kiss, I wanna hold ya
(yeah) I really wanna get you hot tonight (come on)

So tell me what I gotta do to
Get the hookup in the future
Baby you choose the night
Whatever you like and I'm a pick you up on time
And it's cool if you don't want to
But you'd be a fool if you don't want to
Cuz I guarantee, that if you with me, you're gonna be feeling how you supposed to be


Girl give me your number (give it to me)
Forget it, here go my number (here you go)
Forget it, you don't need my number (no you don't)
Cuz we gonna get hot tonight

(That's right)
And if you say
You don't like it my way
We can do it your way
Anyway is OK
And if you say (you say)
You don't like it my way (it don't matter)
We can do it your way (we can do it)
Anyway is OK (anyway that you like it babe)

So tell me what I gotta do to
Get the hookup in the future
If you choose the night
Whatever you like and I'm a pick you up on time
And it's cool if you don't want to
But you'd be a fool if you don't want to
Cuz I guarantee, that if you with me, we're gonna have a good time tonight
(So get your hands up)


Girl give me your number (yeah)
Forget it, here go my number (here you go)
Forget it, you don't need my number (i said forget it, you don't)
Cuz we gonna get hot tonight (right now)
(Come on girl) Girl give me your number (said give it me babe)

Can we break it down
Baby can we break this down
Can we break it down (yeah)
Cuz we gonna get hot tonight

Forget it, here go my number (but you're the only shorty, I'm in love tonight)
