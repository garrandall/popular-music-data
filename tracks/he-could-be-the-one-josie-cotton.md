Yesterday I met a guy
The kind I dream about at night
He said "Come on, let's take a ride"
And I said "Okay, yeah"
Every movie major's really hip
He's hip, uh-huh
He could be the one to come and steal my heart away

He could be the one, I like his style
He could be the one, his love I've tried
He could be the one to make it all worthwhile, yeah
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one

I got to say, he's super fine
I can't get him off my mind
I know he's not a waste of time
He's got it all, yeah
Every movie major's really hip
He's hip, uh-huh
Got my name and number and I'm waiting on his call, hey, oh

He could be the one, I like his style
He could be the one, his love I've tried
He could be the one to make it all worthwhile, yeah
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one

In this modern day and age
There's just another blasting stage
Everybody's out to score
But love to me is so much more! Let's go!

Hey oh!
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one to make it all worthwhile, yeah!
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
I like his style
He could be the one
He could be the one
His love I've tried
He could be the one
He could be the one
I like his style
He could be the one
He could be the one
His love I've tried
