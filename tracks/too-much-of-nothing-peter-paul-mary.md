Too much of nothin' can make a man feel ill at ease
One man's temper might rise, while the other man's temper might freeze.
In the days of long confessions, we can not mock a soul
When there's too much of nothin', no one has control. 

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion,
Send them all my salary, on the waters of oblivion. 

Too much of nothin' can make a man abuse a king
He can walk the streets and boast like most but he don't know a thing.
It's all been done before, it's all been written in the book.
But when it's too much of nothin', nobody should look. 

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion,
Send them all my salary, on the waters of oblivion.

Too much of nothin' can turn a man into a liar
It can cause some man to sleep on nails, another man to eat fire.
Everybody's doin' somethin', I heard it in a dream
But when it's too much of nothin', it just makes a fella mean. 

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Marion,
Send them all my salary, on the waters of oblivion.
