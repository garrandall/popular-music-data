If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight

Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all these things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you

If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight

Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all these things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you
