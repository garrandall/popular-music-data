Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby
It's all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I want to give up
I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright
Hey, everything's alright, so right

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain, yeah

When I see you smile, yeah, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything now
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
Smile at me
