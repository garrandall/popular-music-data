If you could see me now
The one who said he rather roll away
The one who said he rather be alone
If you could only see me now

If I could hold you now
Just for one moment if could really make you mine
Just for a while turn the hands of time
If you could only hold you now

I've been too long in the rain, too long in the wind
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom from of chains
Lying in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

I've been too long in the rain, too long in the wind
Taking any comfort that I can
Yes I'm Looking back and longing for the freedom from of chains
And lying in your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again
