I haven't seen your face in a year 
I can't wait till I get there 
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug 
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight 
and you can pick me up about 8 
I don't know what airline girl 
but I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 

Now I can't sleep at night 
without your 8 x 10 by my side 
that day will come 
for us to be together 
I'm not worried 'bout a thing 
not even stormy weather... 

Oh it may be cold on the east coast 
but on the other side of town it never rains... 

We have so much to talk about 
a lot a catchin' up to do 
I'll bring the diamond girl 
because I'm so into you 
cause they tell me... 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 

Now since I'll be here at your place 
lets take a weeks trip for two 
We don't have to go to far 
just as long as I'm with you 
'cause they tell me... 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 

Can we just be alone 
without those other strangers 
calling your phone 
now I don't want to be 
that selfish kind of guy 
but tonight let me take you 
on a natural high 

just me and you alone 

Now it may be cold on the east coast 
but on the other side of town it never rains... 

Now it may be cold on the east coast 
but on the other side of town it never rains... 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 

Now it may be cold on the east coast 
but on the other side of town it never rains... 

Now it may be cold on the east coast 
but on the other side of town it never rains... 

It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California 
It never rains in southern California
