My life is like a DVD, I took over the streets
Soon as I dropped that PD3
DDT niggaz off the top rope, cop coke
20/10 a piece, nigga my prices vary
Plus it was a 17-5, cherry-green lime
Plenty dick, bitches they say I'm very fine
Hit them every time, never wine or dine
Never treat these bitches like the shit
Like a faucet, nigga I'm the boss, pimp
Bigga got a closet, figure I demolish any nigga tryna ride
Put 'em in the sky
Baby please, I can run through a quarter mil
Often bounce alone, my nigga Frenchie scored a deal
Watch it, how he take it back to Africa, clap at ya
Hit you with the pump, you can call me Count Blackula
7-50 Beamer, not the Acura, Bigga got that caddy
Niggaz doin' good and got you aggy
Ow

We got them bitches in the V.I.P., mad drinks and all, all
Baby said she tryna fuck, she a slut, bitch take it off, off
Yeah, nigga the bullets hit ya face and all, all
And you can war but don't got what it takes to score, ore
