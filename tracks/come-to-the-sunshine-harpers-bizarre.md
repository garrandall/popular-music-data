Come to the sunshine
Hang your ups and downs you come to the sunshine
Come to the sunshine
You know I know you know that I love you

Weather here could not be finer
It suits to sail off Carolina shore
I'll tell you more and moreover
Cotton threads to keep me cool
In the sun-swept afterglow
I know I'm a fool
But I'm hoping that you'll be
Mine in time

Sailboats sail two by two by
I think a lot of you I
Really doubt you think about me like I do you

Come to the sunshine
To the sunshine
You know I know you know that I love you

While they play the White Swan Serenade
Cornered, struck, I watch them promenade
They're comforted, got it made over

Dunn and Bradstreet, Vanity Fair
Who wears what how much and who's been where
But I really don't care
Unless we share

Come to the sunshine
Hang your ups and downs you come to the sunshine
Come to the sunshine
You know I know you know that I love you
