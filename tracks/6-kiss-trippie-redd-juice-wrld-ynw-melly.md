(I love Trippie Redd)

Ohh, oh

Pourin' up fours, mud in my cup
Won't look at the past, it's behind us
Falling in a bottomless pit, find us
Life is a purge, sound of the sirens

Do whatever I want, don't give a fuck, live my life, uh-huh uh-huh
I got your wife, she my slut, she take nut, uh-huh, uh-huh
And I don't walk shit at all, I'm on a money run
I don't got no opps, they stay inside 'cause they scared of my guns
Your bitch say she want a real one, I told her come and find one
It's funny how you pussy but you never been inside one
Aye, these dumb ass virgin ass niggas man
They run when they see the gun in my hand
Bullets like Twitter, they follow them

Nut, my kids, she swallow them
Oh, yeah, she swallow them
Boy, your chain ain't solid gold your jeweler finessed, he hollowed them
You niggas say they with' it, uh, we gon' Harry Potter him
Make that lil' bitch disappear got VVS' in my ear
Oh-oh-oh a chandelier, aye, shinin' on your bitch, we flick
These hoes wanna fuck 'cause I'm so freaky deaky and your bitch gon' eat me
You know that we killin' these fuck niggas, hell nah
Ain't no throwing a wife like hell nah
Pussy boy, we don't buy that, pussy niggas pull up on them and bite that, uh
130 K on a Cuban Link, aye
Shawty wanna fuck, suck the dick, and be my bae, aye
Chillin' on that couch, fuck yo bitch in her mouth
Catch a nigga slippin' put it in his fucking house, Slatt
I ain't with the talkin', I ain't with the talkin'
I ain't with the talkin' put the pussy nigga in the coffin (Oh)
He red, nigga say he bleeding, he red, he red
I'm killing everybody instead, yeah

It be so cold up in the summertime, in the summertime
Diamonds on my fingers, baby blue, they look like Megamind
I don't know reality, bitch, I feel like Coraline
And we from the Northside, pull up, Optimus Prime
I don't wanna miss life, yeah
Promise it feel better taking his life
Yeah, Codeine when I piss right
'Cause we live that fucking triple six life
Yeah, that 6 kiss life
Murder what it is, murder what it is, yeah, murder what it is, uh
I'ma catch a murder in this bitch, that's for certain in this bitch
Like close the burtains in this bitch, uh, yeah

Uh, it's a living hell and we live in hell
I'm from there, living hell, I'm from there, I live in hell, I'm from there, yeah, gang
La-la-la-la, Gang, La-la-la-la
