This is for radio station that hated my songs
They say "yo Russell never try, you'reï»¿ a try hard"
This is for you guys, knockin' my loose pride
Open your eyes, but you can't cause they're too wide
You just a poor asian, you'll never make cake
You a swagger jacker, you a fake Drake
For those dude who beat me up, thinkin they're tough
So all you people sayin "dude get your haircut"
In this moment #1 is my goal
The moon is my brain and the sun is my soul
So I'm a keep grindin till the day I see heaven
Till then I'm a just makin' songs and go gold, maybe platinum
In this game in this sport
It's me, Phili, Dj Suss and Baby J on the court
Against every other labels tryna clash cause they're enemies
So basically it's Mars Music versus the industry
Shout to my friends back home right beside me
If I change cause of the industry, remind me
Cause you know me, so please keep mind
Because in theses lines it's Russel then D-Pryde
Momma's really proud on the what we're all about
I love you momma dukes, I promise you a house
And know that ain't a joke, I'm rhyming till I drop
Mount Everest high and I'm still climbing to the top
This time I'll never stop, I'm playin' this right
I remember what J said that really changed my life
He said "you gotta find a job that absolutely love and when you'll find it,
you'll never work a day in your life"
And that's true J, true say
Since then I look at music in a new way
Haters hate me like the day before tuesday
Reppin Canada like Blue Jays and BublÃ©... uhh
The kid callin' me the new Drake
Haters flyin in the air like a bouquet
Right above the one but I'm never at a zero
Man I'm reppin for the asian cause we never had a hero
Put your glass up, I'm up and higher
Still drinkin' Arizona like I'm sponsored by them
This is for my family, growing like an apple tree
For my mother that had to witness my daddy leave
Like I had to be, but I'm a keep movin'
Shout out to all of my fans who loved my sweet music
And how I speak thru it, who think I'm kinda tight
Peanut butter ain'tï»¿ an ingredient to this dynamite
