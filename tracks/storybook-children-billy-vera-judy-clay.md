You've got your world
And I've got mine
And it's a shame
Two grown up worlds
That will never be the same

Why can't we be
Like storybook children
Running through the rain
Hand in hand
Across the meadow
Why can't we be
Like storybook children
In a wonderland
Where nothing's planned for tomorrow

You've got his ring
You've got his heart
You've got his baby
And Billy it's too late
To turn away
And start all over again
Oh no, don't tell me it's too late baby

Why can't we be
Like storybook children
Running through the rain
Hand in hand
Across the meadow
Oh, why, one more time
Why can't we be
Like storybook children
In a wonderland
In a wonderland
Where nothing's planned for tomorrow

Ooh, how happy we would be
If only we
Were storybook children
