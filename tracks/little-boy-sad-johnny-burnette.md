You been lying
Being untrue
Now they call me
Little Boy Blue

(CHORUS)
Someday, baby
You're gonna find
Nobody in the world's
Gonna give you loving
As sweet as mine

You been cheating
Doing me bad
Now they call me
Little Boy Sad

Someday, baby
You're gonna see
Nobody in the world's
Gonna give you loving
As sweet as me

Little Boy Blue
That's my name
Little Boy Sad
You're to blame

You been sneaking
Doing me dirt
Now they call me
Little Boy Hurt

(CHORUS)

Little Boy Blue
That's my name
Little Boy Sad
You're to blame

You been sneaking
Doing me dirt
Now they call me
Little Boy Hurt

(CHORUS)

Nobody in the world's
Gonna give you loving
As sweet as mine, oh, yeah

Nobody in the world's
Gonna give you loving
As sweet as mine
