Wheezy outta here


I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission


None of this shit came free, got it out the street, had to take a chance, yeah
Put the cake in the rubber band, stuff in my pants, I can do the band dance
Thousand dollar Fear of God Vans, drip when I'm playing, just call me Raf stan
Of course they dig what I'm saying, another advance, smoking me a strong strand
Ice all on my watch, add it to the card, had to get the cars washed
Heated marble squares on the floor
The condo got a bar, cost me an Aventador
Yeah, punch in this shit to record
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court
My spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court


I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission


Runnin' the sea on my wave
New two door coupe came with leather and suede
Fuck with this bitch 'cause she goin' both ways
Too much of this shit, I'ma throw it in bags
Not fuckin' you bitches from back in the day
My condo is raised, they dig like a grave
Gettin' in my bag and my family amazed
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Call me your dawg, hold me down to the grave


I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission
