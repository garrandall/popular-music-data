I don't know
Should I stay
Should I go
Yeah, I know
It's the remix, remix

Yeah

See I'm in this situation
Think I need a little help
Let's go


When this began, we were friends
She knew all my business (business)
All my good, all my bad
Said that she was with it (now)
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothing like that girl I used to know
Didn't believe she would creep
Thought we was forever (oh)
She broke out, I broke down
& that's just all that left of us (oh)
Now these memories, they be haunting me
You ain't feeling me
My girl's about to go 


& I really wanna work this out
Cause I'm tired of fighting (if that don't work) &
I really hope she still want me the way I want her (you'll get your feelings hurt)
I said I really wanna work this out
Damn girl I'm trying
Here's the remix (remix)


I got this ice box where my heart used to be  but (said)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (ohh)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold




Ha pimping listen 
Hold up now
Take your time
Let me get this right (huh)
You tripping on what's in front of you
Cause you're looking behind you (yeah but I mean)
You got memories (but)
Take it from me (cause)
She ain't nothing like oh girl you used to know
If shawty's doing right by you
Maybe you should let it go
At the end of the day,
It ain't worth it
Wanna know how I know (how you know)
Remember confessions
So you already know that it's gonna hurt
Shawty, learn your lesson
You don't really wanna feel the burn 

No, listen


If you really wanna work it out
Then stop denying (denying)
Quit living in the past of time
You face the truth (truth)
If it's ever gonna work out
You gotta stop lying
Stop blaming her when it's you, that's


Got the ice box where your heart used to be
Got a ice box where your heart used to be


I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold (ohh)
I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold 

 Boy you gotta ice box 




I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold cold world
Don't wanna mess this up
Better keep your eye on me, girl 


Leave the past in the past
Gotta let it go (say bra)
You gotta know when to move on (say bra)
You gotta know when to let go (yes sir)
Don't lose ya lady






This is the remix
This is the remix
Go ahead replay it
This is the remix 


Omarion
Girl, I really wanna work this out
Cause I'm tired of fighting
