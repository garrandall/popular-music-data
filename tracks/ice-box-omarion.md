Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again (Again)
I know that it's my fault you don't understand (No)
I got memories (Uh), this is crazy (Uh)
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas (My niggas)
I should try, truth is I wanna let you in, but (No)
Damn these memories (Uh), and it's crazy (Uh)
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know (Oh)


Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fighting (Tired of fighting)
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you (You, you)
I said I really wanna work this out, damn, girl, I'm trying (I'm trying, yeah)
It's no excuse, no excuse (But I got this)


I got this icebox where my heart used to be (But I got this)
Got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got it)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (But I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this)
Got this icebox where my heart used to be (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold


Why can't I get it right? Just can't let it go (Go)
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more (No)
I got memories (Uh), this is crazy (Uh)
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you, baby, but I can't help it
'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it (And I)
I apologize (For makin' you cry)
Look me in my eyes and promise you won't do me the same, yeah, yeah


Girl, I really wanna work this out, 'cause I'm tired of fighting (Fighting)
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you (Baby, I want you)
I said I really wanna work this out, damn, girl, I'm trying (Oh, no, no)
It's no excuse, no excuse


I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this)
Got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got it)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this icebox)
Got this icebox where my heart used to be (Ayy, yeah)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold


I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold, cold world
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl
I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold, cold world ('Cause I don't wanna be)
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl (Keep your eye on me)
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me, girl (Girl, oh)


Girl, I really wanna work this out, 'cause I'm tired of fighting (Yeah)
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you (Woo)
I said I really wanna work this out, damn, girl, I'm trying (Yeah)
It's no excuse, no excuse


I said I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Got this icebox where my heart used to be (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (No)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (Yeah)
Now I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Oh)
