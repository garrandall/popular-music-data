To freak ya more than an (hour)
With so much mad funk I need (A shower)
In the pooper scooper master plan
'Cause I'm the super duper trooperman
Yeah, mythical, get physical, so here we go
Give us a flavour built down til ya embryo
My style, rowdy and wild
Swig it up, hit it up, live it up, yeah


Hey you people over there
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air
It's a funky groove made to make you move
(Well alright)
So let the party people say




Boh, I think I gots the fever

Pumpin' up the pumpin up the meter
Label me a ringleader, mad party pleader
Makees with a store
A lead up ta lead up ta lead up
Spot, hey, can you dig it?
I come alive, darling, give me what you got
Becka, rumpshteckup
Pump your fists up
Yo check this out I don't but cheques or bust slipper


To the morning light
Gonna make you feel all right
Pump it up all night
Body rock, show me what you got
Let Rob bring back the boom spot

There is a dance over there, and dance over here
Everybody combine in a fabulous wear
There is swingin' an' winin', champagne an' dinin'
Preety people screamin' and jostlin'
See an' see man a girl man chillin'
Let's get funky, all right to the rythm
All through da job sites is see Job skatin'
Ladies lend your bodies, don't slow non stoppin'

Ladies, let your body flow
