We'll grow old, we'll take care of each other
I'll be your sister, your mother, your lover
We'll be friends during changes of weather
Let's be together on our own
Let's be together alone

We're believers, we've been hurt by believing
Needing people, we know looking's not seeing
I see needs that might be answered by forever
Together on our own
Let's be together alone

We'll learn living, like the words of a good song
We'll learn timing, balance and rhythm
We'll make it music
I don't want to sing it on my own
Let's be together, let's be together alone

Let's be together alone...

We'll grow old, we'll take care of each other
I'll be sister, mother and lover
We'll be friends
I'm tired of singing it alone
Let's be together alone
