Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down
I get up
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...
Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what's right
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...
