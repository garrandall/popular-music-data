Some Things Will Never Change
Some Things We'll Never Know
Walking Down the Rocky Road
Down and Out
With So Far to Go
Without You On My Mind
I'd Never Make It
Without the Stars in the Sky
Well Love Is Love
And One Is One
So I Turn Around
To Head For the Sun
And Now I'm On My Way

Chorus
Without Any Hope
Without You On My Mind
Without Any Dreams
Without the Stars in the Sky
Without Any Love
There's Nothing At All
So I'm On My Way Home
And I'm Walking
Walking Through Walls

Some Days Just Never End
Some Days Go to Slow
Walking Down the Rocky Road
Down and Out
With So Far to Go
Without You On My Mind
I'd Never Make It
Without the Stars in the Sky
Well Love Is Love
And I Lost the Fight
So I Turn Around
And Head For the Light
And Now I'm On My Way
