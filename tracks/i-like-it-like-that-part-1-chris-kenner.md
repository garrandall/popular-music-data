Oh My God/That's The Way I Like It
Oh my God
(Oh my God)
I've been saved
I saw the light today and it flung me back to the edge

Oh my God
What are you asking of me?
What have I done to you lately that could make you treat me so badly?

Oh my God
I've been sitting by the fence
Wondering which one of you I'm going to visit in the end

This is the world, brother, as you made it to be
Whatever in it of strife and pain, you put there for us to see
For us to see
And I see it

That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh
You should wash your hair first, uh huh uh huh

I'm going out tonight, gonna get it on
I'm gonna go to the bar
Gonna spend all my money, innit that funny?
That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh
You should hold me down, cross my legs

Here it comes now
You can feel it stretching down the street like two pairs of legs
They're walking your way
And you like it, you like it
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it, uh huh uh huh
Yeah, that's the way, uh huh uh huh
You would like it, uh huh uh huh
You would like it if I played that way
That's the way, uh huh uh huh
That's the way, uh huh uh huh
That's the way, uh huh uh huh
I like it
