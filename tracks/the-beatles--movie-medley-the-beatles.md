Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Step right this way

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

Wo, wo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Whoa

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
And she don't care

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Do
