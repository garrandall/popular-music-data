You wear a mask of burning gold
Your heart is wild but your touch is cold
I ask myself, are you my enemy
Or is it just a fire, the fire in you and me?

Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you

Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
(Let me be forgiven)

You wear your love much too thin
You push me away just to pull me in
I ask myself, is faith that way
If I reason it, do I reason it all away?

Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you

Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven

Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
(Let me be forgiven)
(Say, say, say, say yeah, yeah)

There are times
When I feel alone
Then I find
That you're there all along, oh yeah

Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
I'm on my way
Let me be forgiven

Let me be forgiven

Am I forgiven?
