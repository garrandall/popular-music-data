Well now little girl
You hurt me so
Oh now little girl
Don't you treat me so

Well now little girl
My hearts broke in two
Oh now little girl
Why can't you be true

Well now little girl
I'm gonna say goodbye
Oh please please girl
I can't see you cry

So now little girl
Promise you'll do
Oh oh little girl
Just say you'll be true

Well now little girl
I'm gonna say goodbye
Oh please little girl
I can't see you cry

So now little girl
Promise you'll do
Oh oh little girl
Just say you'll be true
