Yea, DMX
Straight out of ATL
Ya' Mean
We got Yung Wun, choppin that thing baby,
Once Again, Swiss Beats, Full Surface,


Bounce, Bounce
When I'm drunk in the club, I might just start sum shit,
Block party in the hood, I might just start sum shit,
Underground Downtown, I might just start sum shit,
Gimme the keys to the city, Ima lock this bitch,
They aint gon take me alive and u can bet dat,
Hit 'em where the chest at,
Hit 'em where the neck at,
Show me where the rest at,
They in the same building livin' like a mess pack,
From my eyes from where the deck at
Bet Dat, Shawty,
U and me gonna ride over to the other side,
Its time these muthafuckas die,
First make a prank call and get the kidz out the house,
I aint tryin to kill no kids, Ima turn they lights out


AAAAAAHHHH, Tear it Up, Lemme see you Tear It Up
All across the board we gon Tear It Up,
We gon bounce it till the beat cut off,
We gon rock dis muthafucka till the wheels fall off


Mississippi mutherfucker, Pop a dick in ur mouth,
Southside till I die, smokin dro in the drop,
I Make a bitch gimme money then I'm kickin her out,
I spit game to your wife, then we robbin your house,
Yall niggas love that way that we grippin the grain,
If you got it and I want it, I aint callin your name,
Just lay it down, Fuck Boy, like I'm ballin G,
You get yo' chest in yo' lap if you fuckin with me




You might catch me at the Rose Bowl game,
In a 4-door range,
With a Rose gold chain,
Wrapped around my neck,
Or I might be flashin' in a white G-wagon,
With my arm out the window, grippin' a Tech,
Dawg, get it right, I got Houston on lock,
I kit it right, I switch the lights every time I buy a drop,
Homey, U got Swiss on the beat,
I gotta come with da heat,
It's David Banner, Yung Wun, and F-L-I-P


Get it crunk in this,
Set it Off in this thing,
We sittin here leanin' by tha bar
Didn't know we drunk in this thing
