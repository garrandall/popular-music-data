Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-not's
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it


Oh, make you want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no


Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die


Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life


Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes


Make me want to holler
And throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me want to holler
And throw up both my hands


Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading


Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply because we wear our hair long
