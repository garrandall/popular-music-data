Rockets, moon shot
Spend it on, the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make me wanna holler
Way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no

Inflation, no chance
To increase, finance
Bills pile up, sky high
Send that boy off, to die

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no

Hang ups, let down
Bad breaks, set back
Natural, fact is
I can't pay my, taxes

Woah, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Crime is, increasin'
Trigger happy, policin' (good god)
Panic, is spreading
God knows where, we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand, hey hey
Make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no

This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
