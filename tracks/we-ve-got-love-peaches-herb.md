I could be tryin'
Look the rest of my life
To find that special love
Yeah

And the moment I saw you
I immediately thought
I took one look into your eyes
And I knew it

We've got love
We've got the world
We've got the joy
We've got the happiness

That number one feelin'
That beautiful togetherness
You are truly Heaven sent
With that magical ingredient

Oh, we've got love
Let's express that love somehow
Let's express it
Right here and now

With a beautiful
Beautiful vow
'Cause right here and now
Right here and now

Oh, we've got love
We got love, we've got love
We've got love, yeah

Don't ever wonder
Don't you doubt that this
Heart of mine is full of love, yeah

And as I see others search
For their fountain of happiness
I sure am glad you're mine
And I'll show it

You've got love
You've got the world
You've got the joy
You've got the happiness

That number one feeling
That beautiful togetherness
You are truly Heaven sent
With that magical ingredient

Oh, we've got love
Let's express that love somehow
Let's express it
Right here and now

With a beautiful, beautiful vow
'Cause right here and now
'Cause right here and now
We've got love, love, oh

The thrill of your touch will
Stay burning inside me forever
The love in our hearts will
Keep bringing us closer together

You are truly Heaven sent
With that magical ingredient
I said, "Truly Heaven sent
With that magical ingredient"

Oh, we've got love
We've got love
Let's express that love
Somehow, somehow

Let's express it
Right here and now
With a beautiful, beautiful vow
'Cause right here and now
'Cause right here and now

Oh, we've got love
We've got love
Let's express that love
Somehow, somehow

Let's express it
Right here and now
With a beautiful
Beautiful vow
