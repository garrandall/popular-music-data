Give me your hand
Give me your lips
Give me your heart

Give me your vow
Please tell me now
We'll never part

Surely you know
That I will keep you
Safe from harm

You're all I need
Humbly, I plead
Give me your love

(Give me your hand
Give me your lips)
Give me your heart

(Give me your vow
Please tell me now)
We'll never part

(Surely you know
That I will keep you
Safe from harm)

(You're all I need
Humbly, I plead
Give me your love)

Come vous voulez
Give me your lips
Give me your heart

Come vous voulez
Please tell me now
We'll never part

Surely you know
That I will keep you
Safe from harm

Jes done teu
Vous desiree
Give me your love

(Give me your love)
