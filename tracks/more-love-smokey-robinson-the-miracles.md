Oh oh whooh whooh

Let it be soon, don't hesitate
Make it now (right now my love) don't wait (don't wait)
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart

With more love, and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
And my love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

This is no fiction
This is no act
This is real (so real my love) it's a fact (it's a fact)
I'll always belong only to you
Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you

More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy, oh honey now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear-air it down

Mmm whoooh whooh whooh whooh whooh

Mmm mmm
As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me (need me my love) I'll be here (I'll be here)
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful and keeping you youthful

With more love, more joy
Than age or time can ever destroy, oh honey now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

Gonna give you more ohnd more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy, oh baby now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hun...
