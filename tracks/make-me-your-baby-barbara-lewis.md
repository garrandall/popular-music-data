I'm gonna kiss you in a special way
Make me your baby
I'll find a way to please you every day
Make me your baby

Make me, make me your baby (ooh-ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe you will see
Paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby), oh

You'll know a love no one has known before
Make me your baby
A love that we would share forever more
When I'm your baby

Make me, make me your baby (ooh-ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe you will see
Paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby)

Make me your baby
Oh, make me your baby

Make me, make me your baby (ooh-ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe you will see
Paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby (make me your baby)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and make me your baby (make me your baby)
Can't you see I want to be your baby
