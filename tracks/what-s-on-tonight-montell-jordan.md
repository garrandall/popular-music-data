I'm coming over
Coming, coming, listen girl

I'm whispering words over your shoulder
Oh can't you hear
Before you reply the temperature rise
Then like that you disappear
I never imagined
I'd get so excited
Over a rendezvous
I'll be there in an hour still wet from the shower
I just called to tell you

1 - It's on tonight
The feeling's right
We don't have to go nowhere
Listen girl I'm coming over

Rub your back, massage your shoulders
I just wanna lay it on you

2 - Girl can you tell me what's on tonight
I'm coming to your crib
Have dinner by candlelight
And we gonna watch some TV
We gonna play your CD's
I'm gonna be on you
And you're gonna be on me

Repeat 2

I pray that you're wearing Victoria Secrets
Oh, that blows my mind
Now what should I bring
Strawberries I'm thinking
Or some honey for your toes
I never imagined I get so excited
So aroused by you
So click on the cable
I'll put on a slow jam
Montell is coming

Repeat 1

Don't you try to go no where
I just wanna lay it on you

Repeat 2 until fade
