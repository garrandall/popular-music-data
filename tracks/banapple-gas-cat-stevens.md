Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
Everybody's sniffing it Banapple gas
O-o alas!
All the world is stuck on it Banapple gas.

Does it do you good, make you better
Set you healthy when you're bed-tied?
Well I don't know if it makes you well...
But it must be healthy
'Cause it don't smell.

Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
Everybody's living on Banapple gas
O-o alas!
All the world is grooving on Banapple gas.

Do you know what goes inside to make it
What kind of strange spice makes it right?
Well I don't know what kind of spice
But it must be healthy 'cause it's sterilized.

Banapple gas...Banapple gas
Give me more Banapple gas
O-o...o-o-o

Does it help you smile more to wake up
Make you happy just to be alive?
Well I don't know if it makes you happy...
But it must be healthy
'Cause it's certified.

Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
All the world is breathing Banapple gas
O-o alas!
No one knows what's inside it Banapple gas
Oh Banapple gas.
