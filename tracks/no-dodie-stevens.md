No
(Hey baby, won't you give me a kiss?)
I said no
(Just a little kiss you never will miss)
Just plain no
(Why do you torture me like this)
Don't you understand English?

No
(There's a lot of huggin' I gotta do)
N-O, No
(And I wanna do my huggin' with you)
Please let go
(Come a little closer, baby)
Of my hand
(Why do you treat me like you do?)

Every time I let you kiss me, kiss me
My heart goes on a roller coaster ride
And every time I let you kiss me, kiss me
I get the little butterflys inside me

No
(There's a lot of huggin' I gotta do)
Uh-uh, no
(And I wanna do my huggin' with you)
Please let go
(Come a little closer, baby)
Of my hand
(Why do you treat me like you do?)



Oh
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, de-do)
Must you go
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, de-do)
Don't you know
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
That a girl means yes, when she says

No
(Got another number I'm gonna call)
N-O, No
(In an hour I'll be having a ball)
Don't let go
(Guess I'll stay here after all)
When I say no

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, de-do)
Don't let go
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, de-do)
Don't let go
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, de-do)
Don't let go
