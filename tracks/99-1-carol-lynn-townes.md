Minus just a bit
Our love will never fit
You said, too bad
Our love won't reach it's peak
If there is the slightest break
You took the best that I had

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough

No, babe

Without one half percent
Our love is incomplete
That's how I knew
The last drop of your love
Should belong to only me
But your eyes is for real

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough

Won't do, do, do...

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
(Gotta be me and you)
All of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough

Ninety-nine and a half won't do
All of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
