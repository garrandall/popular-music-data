I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la


Do what you want
I'm telling you
Let me into your heart


Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you


Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me?
I'ma get you, girl, ah!)


This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see us far then near


Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit
I really love you, girl
Oh, oh God


Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love


I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me in
Girl you really got a hold, woo!
