Call out the instigator
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And you know it's right
And you know that it's right

We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together, now

Run through the fields and houses
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And you know it's right
And you know that it's right

We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together, now

Call out the instigator
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And you know it's right
And you know that it's right

We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together, now
