Call out the instigators
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And you know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now


Lock up the streets and houses
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here,
And you know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now


Hand out the holy spirits
We got to remake all our life
Hand out the arms and ammo
We're going to blast our way through here
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the moment will arrive, and you know its right
Because the revolution's here, and you know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now
Get it together
Feeling something in the air
Don't you feel it together
Sooner or later
Can't you feel it coming
Sooner or later
