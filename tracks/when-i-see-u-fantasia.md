Everybody like he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em
He one nights 'em
And I value my friends to hang 'cause I don't wanna fight 'em
But I'm really feelin' that this one is the right one
You always on my mind when the night comes
So I leave a key under the door mat just in case you might come
Staring at my window
Picture on my wall
Phone on my pillow so I hear it if you call
If you saw how I be when I see you
Baby I even be blushing when I leave you
Its something bout my body being next to you
So sexy boy
You sexy boy
You make me shy
And I get nervous
If you know it I think you staring at my eyes on purpose
So I'm wishing on a sign hoping for it to come true
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue


I put your picture on my mirror,
Start to blush when somebody say's your name
In my Stomach theres a pain
See you walk in my direction I go the other way
I start to stutter when I Speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What happening to me in the dark can you tell me what it means
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Its the Reason why
Your always on my mind
When you come around I'm shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never no when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you when I see you
I scribble X and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face when I here my Favorite song
Should I Send an email at home
Your the number 1 topic on the phone,
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue
I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Whats the reason why Yeah...


Something now is taking over me and I don't know how
But I gotta be on time when ever you come around
Ask me when I'm coming
I'm coming right now
I think about you whenever I go to Mr. Charles
Got a pen n a napkin
Writing our names down
Our first name
With your last name
I know we not married but I'm practicing
I'm not going to run
I'm having fun
Doing whatever your ready tell me
I'mma have your son
With you in my presents
I'mma different individual
Things drastically change
And you are my visual
See I'm prepared
Or I'm so scared, nothing compares to how much I care
So I'm wishing on a sign and hoping it comes true
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue
