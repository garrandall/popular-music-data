Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say...

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah
