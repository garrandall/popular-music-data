Got nowhere to go, all night to get there
But I'm going there with you
Tonight we're running on luck
If we're gonna use it all up
There's only one thing left to do

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

You look way too good
This feels way too right
It'd be way too wrong to stop
And it's sure worth drinking to
So baby here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

One life, one chance
One ticket to the big dance
You and me still holding on
Right down to the last song

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Yeah, 'til it's gone

You're sure worth drinking to
Baby, here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop

I'm gonna drink it all up
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone, it's gone
