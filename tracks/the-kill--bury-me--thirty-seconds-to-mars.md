What if I wanted to break,
Laugh it all off in your face,
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor,
Couldn't take all this anymore,
What would you do, do, do?

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you.

What if I wanted to fight,
Beg for the rest of my life,
What would you do?
You say you wanted more.
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you.
Look in my eyes.
You're killing me, killing me.
All I wanted was you.

I tried to be someone else,
But nothing seemed to change.
I know now, this is who I really am inside.
Finally found myself
Fighting for a chance.
I know now, this is who I really am.

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you, you, you.
Look in my eyes.
You're killing me, killing me.
All I wanted was you.

Come, break me down (bury me, bury me).
Break me down (bury me, bury me).
Break me down (bury me, bury me).

(You say you wanted more)
What if I wanted to break?
(What are you waiting for?)
Bury me, bury me
(I'm not running from you)
What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I...
Bury me, bury me.
