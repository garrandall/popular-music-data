You gotta known how to have fun when you get these checks man. 
Nah, Iâmma put this on your camera. You needâ¦ Iâm bout to tell you right now.  
Tell me what I need. Tity Boi. Tity Boi.  
You need to tell Cris go on let you go. 
Young Mula it out, we have fun over here, we just eating.  
We having fun, we just doing stuff, we donât even care about. 
(Go get my shit). Young Money, we care

If it wasnât for Wayne, it wouldnât be
A lot of dudes in the game, including me
We was smoking that gas in â03
Was gonâ sell a few bags to Lil Fee
Couple years removed from HBs
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z
I went to Eastover before Katrina
Remember going to Magic riding in my B-mer
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappinâ and singinâ
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts
And then I went on tour and recorded a song on your tour bus
And that was â08, thatâs the first time I met Drake
When I hit your cup with that drank, had a nigga stomach like wait


That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, 
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, 
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dio, yea that my dog

You relocated to MIA
You told me shawdy this where I stay
I came down to pay a visit
You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin
And you, you wasnât dippinâ
Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant
Ridinâ off in the Phantom, and Mr. G he was driving
Pumpinâ that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding
And I told you that I was rappinâ, I told you I wasnât writing
You said Luda was foolish because he wasnât excited
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci
You said, âYou can make a million rappinâ âbout some pussy, I did.â
T, Fewq, Mally Mal, shining like Armor Oil
You can ask Mac, I was YM âfore all of yâall
Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny
In this world you either selling or you buying


That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, 
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, 
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea that my dog

You tatted your face and changed the culture
You screamed soowoo and them gangstas loved it
You bought a Bugatti so you can flex
And most of the bad bitches your ex
Ride âtil the wheels fall off and they got wobbly
Duffle Bag video, we shot that bitch on Godby
You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate
They said it ainât about stylinâ, what they tryinâ to kick knowledge
Duffle Bag Boys, yea I canât forget Dolla
In going to get the money, itâs some words that I follow
I swallow my pride, smoking endo outside
Straight from Collegrove, Iâm reporting live


That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, 
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, 
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea that my dog
