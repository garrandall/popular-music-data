No, don't shoot me down (Yeah)
No, don't shoot me down (Ok)
No, don't shoot me down

You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck, we show 'em no respect

When the time's right, when the time's right, baby
A boy is a gun
(Turn me up a little bit)
Don't, don't shoot me down

Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fucking mind up, I am sick of waiting patiently
How come you the best to me, I know you the worst for me
You sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies got me on the fencies
Whole squad again, the travel bag by Balenci'
Big dog hittin' big wheelies on the 6 speed

Don't, don't shoot me down
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck, they show 'em no respect

When the time's right, when the time's right, baby
A boy is a gun

Oh you passive aggressive, oh, you fakin' you're mad?
Oh you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah I'm brushing you off
'Cause this parka is comb You're my favorite garcon

Don't leave, stay right here, yeah I want you right near
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if he 'round the garden 'round this time next year

No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down (Fucked up)
No, don't shoot me down

You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
When the time's right, when the time's right, baby
A boy is a gun

You're a gun, 'cause I like you on my side at all times, you keep me safe
Wait, wait, depending on, you know
You could be dangerous to, to me, or anyone else

Look, they be bringing us up yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' about, I see you as a 10
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me, stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself but stay the fuck away from me

A boy is a gun
Don't, don't shoot me down
A boy is a gun
