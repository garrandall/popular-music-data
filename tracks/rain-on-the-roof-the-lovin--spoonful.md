You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Drying while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waiting out the sun

You and me, we're gabbing away
Dreamy conversation, sitting in the hay
Honey, how long was I laughing in the rain with you?
Cause I didn't feel a drop til the thunder brought us to

You and me underneath a roof of tin
Pretty comfy feeling, how the rain ain't leaking in
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour
Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more

You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Drying while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waiting out the sun
