Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do?

'Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right
Right, right, right here?

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?"

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
I'm ready for combat
