WEEKEND
Wet Willie
One Friday evenin'
What a feelin', feel like singin'
Tired of workin', my mind is buzzin'
Feel like dancin' yes I do
But you gotta make the best of life while you're young
Good people, weekend
Do just what you wanna do, weekend
When those workin' days are through
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Weekend, weekend
You know it's time to get away, weekend
I wanna hear ev'rybody say
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Saturday night feelin' just right
Makin' new friends, lazy Sunday
Every Monday ends my weekend, yes it does
But you gotta make the best of life while you're young
Listen people, weekend
Party down with all your friends, weekend
It's party, hearty time again
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Weekend, weekend
Spendin' all my hard-earned pay, weekend
With crazy nights and lazy days
Weekend, weekend, weekend
But you believe me right now, weekend
Watchin' all the people play, weekend
I wanna hear ev'rybody say
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Weekend, weekend
Do what you wanna do, weekend
When those workin' days are through
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ah you gotta make the best of life while you're young
Right now, weekend
Do what you wanna do, weekend
When those workin' days are through
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Yeah weekend
