Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really really wanna catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
I must really like you
There's not a lotta guys are worth my time
Oh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind


And it feels like oh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like oh(Oh, oohohoh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)


Oh, baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Oh, it set my soul on fire
Oh baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild


It feels like oh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like oh(Oh, oohohoh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)


"I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin like, "Oww! (Oh, oh oh
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention? (Oww!)
You're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (Oww)


'Cause my lovin' feels like oh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like oh(Oh, oohohoh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)


Will you ever know it?
No no no no no, no no
Will you ever know it?


"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doin'?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this, but uhh...
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man"


And it feels like oh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
Baby, baby, I swear, it's like oh
But you don't know my name, no no no
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And it feels like oh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)


And I swear on my mother and father it feels like...
Oh, oh oohohohhoh
Oh, oh oohohohhoh
Oh, oh oh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
