We've had some fun
Yes, we've had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road
But here we are still around

We thought about someone else
But neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up
Now we know it's much too late


We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address


(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) 'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me




(oh wa-oh
We've had our doubts
We never took them seriously
(oh wa-oh
And we've had our ins and outs
But that's the way it's s'posed to be

We thought about giving up (giving up)
But we could never stay away
We thought about breaking up (oh wa oh
But now we know it's much too late


And it's no great mystery (Oh)
If we change our minds
Eventually
It's back to you and me


(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes, it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes, it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) 'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address


(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Oh) 'cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me


(Oh, yes, it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Oh, wa-oh I'm happy to be stuck with you
(Oh, wa-oh Happy to be stuck with you
(Oh, yes, it's true)
