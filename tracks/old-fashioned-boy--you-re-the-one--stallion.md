I'm an old fashioned boy cause I believe in love
And you're the only one that I've been thinking of
When I met you baby I knew from the start
That you were the one who could steal my heart

Chorus
You're the one that I've been looking for forever
The one that made my life seem so much better
You appeared to me, darling I can see
You're the one, you're the one for me to love

I'm an old fashioned boy cause I believe in love
And just like the stars shining down from above
It only took a moment for you to set my soul free
You gave me such a feeling that it had to be

You're the one that I've been looking for forever
The one that made my life seem so much better
You appeared to me, darling I can see
You're the one, you're the one for me to love
The one that I've been looking for forever
You're the one, you're the one for me to love

Chorus
