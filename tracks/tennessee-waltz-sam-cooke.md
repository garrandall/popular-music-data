I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I untroduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost 
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
