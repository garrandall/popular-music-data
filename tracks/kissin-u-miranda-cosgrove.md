Sparks fly,
It's like electricity
I might die
When I forget how to breathe
You get closer
And there's nowhere
In this world I'd rather be

Time stops like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these
Few moments
When you open
My mind to things I've never seen

'Cause when I'm kissing you my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place,
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you

When I'm kissing you it all starts making sense
And all the questions I've been asking in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear it becomes when I'm kissing you

Past loves
They never got very far
Walls up
Made sure I guarded my heart
And now I promised
I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me

But no one, no guy that I've met before
Could make me feel so right and secure
And have you noticed
I lose my focus,
And the world around me disappears?

'Cause when I'm kissing you my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place,
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you

When I'm kissing you it all starts making sense
And all the questions I've been asking in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear it becomes when I'm kissing you

I've never felt nothing like this
You're making me open up
No point even trying to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love

'Cause when I'm kissing you my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place,
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you

When I'm kissing you it all starts making sense
And all the questions I've been asking in my head
Like, "Are you the one? Should I really trust?"
Crystal clear it becomes when I'm kissing you
