Wanna hop on jet, take off your panties, huh (Hoo)

Cocoa on my Maybach like it's Freaknik (Smash, smash)
Shoot the hundred round and get your street sweeped (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Patek on my wrist, this shit ain't cheap, cheap (Woo)
Perky or the Addy, which one you gon' eat?
If we got status in the back then meet the Grim Reap' (Static, baddy)
Green light the Lambo', with your bitch creepin' (Skrrt)

And my bitch ride for me like Remy (Remy)
Poppin' shots, thug life, Makaveli (Yeah, bah bah)
Send the cash to my celly, have my nigga go get it
Then we split it like a splinter, if I'm in it, it ain't rented (Skrrt)
Got the rims so biggie that my tires look skinny
Good pussy and you pretty, but you better off the Henny, yeah
I ain't Ray J, told a bitch, "Wait a minute," damn (Hold up)
Diamonds on my dick, told the bitch, "Come and get it" (Hold up)
