You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady


Don't think I don't see them looking at ya
All of them wishing they could have ya
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin'for you to scratch'em
I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to come with the real
And I'm-a gonna make it know
Cause I want them to know


You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady


You're my little baby, my darling baby
I swear you're the talk of the town
And everybody wants to know what's going down
Babe, I know they've seen us before
Maybe at the liquor store, or maybe at the health food stand
They don't know that I'm your man


You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady


I can tell they're looking at us
I pick you up every day from your job
(You're my lady)
And every guy in the parking lot wants to rob me of my girl
And my heart and soul, and everybody wants to treat me so cold
But I know I love you and you love me
There's no other lover for you or me
You're my lady


I can tell they're looking at us
I can tell they're looking at us
I can tell they're looking at us
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady
My divine lady
You're my lady
Such a wonderful lady
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady, ohhh ohhh ohhh
You're my lady, ohhh yeah
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady, ohh
And everybody wants to know what's going down
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
I can tell they're looking at us
You're my lady
You're my lady
