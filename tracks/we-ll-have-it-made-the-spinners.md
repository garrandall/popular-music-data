Get down, now


Walkin' through the moonlight
'Til the sun gets in our eyes
Holdin' on for dear life
As we grab the sunrise


We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah


Every eye will follow
But none will understand
Most love is hollow
But ours has strength to stand


We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah


'Cause when we build all our dreams come true
And every day we'll find things to do
Could make this love as endless as time
Together we will leave tears behind


Ridin' high on the future
We know which way to climb
We've found what's due us
And we'll get it all the time


We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah


Oh
(Hey, have it made)
We'll have it made
(Hey, have it made)
Oh oh alright


'Cause when we build all our dreams come true
And every day we'll find things to do
Could make this love as endless as time
Together we will leave tears behind


Ridin' high on the future
We know which way to climb
We found what's due us
And we'll get it all the time


We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah


Get with it now
(Hey, have it made)
We'll have it made
(Hey, have it made)
Oh baby
(Hey, have it made)
Baby, have it made
(Hey, have it made)
Oh
(Hey, have it made)
We'll have it made
(Hey, have it made)
Ridin' on the future
(Hey, have it made)
(Hey, have it made)
