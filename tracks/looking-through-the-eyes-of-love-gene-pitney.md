In the eyes of the world I'm a loser just wastin' my time
I can't make a dime
In the eyes of the world being born was my first big mistake
I can't get a break
But in the eyes of my woman I stand
Like a hero, a giant, a man who's as tall as can be
Any fool can see

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.

In the eyes of the crowd I'm a do-nothin' kind of a guy
Who'll just live and die
In the eyes of the crowd I'm another poor Joe on the street
Can't get on my feet
But in the eyes of my woman they're wrong
I'm a king and a lover as strong and as brave as can be
Any fool can see

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.

She's making me believe someday
Someday I'm gonna find a way
To be the man that she can see 
When she looks at me (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love.
