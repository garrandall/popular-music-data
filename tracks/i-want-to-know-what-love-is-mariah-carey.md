I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older, hey


In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life


I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me


I'm gonna take a little time (Take a little time)
A little time to look around me (Oh)
I've got nowhere left to hide (Nowhere left to hide)
It looks like love has finally found me (Ohh)


In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life


I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is (Feel what love is)
And I know you can show me
Show me, I wanna know
I wanna know what love is
(Ohh, I wanna know)
I want you to show me
(And I'm feeling so much love)
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel)
And I know you can show me, hey, yeah
I wanna know what love is
Let's talk about love
I want you to show me
