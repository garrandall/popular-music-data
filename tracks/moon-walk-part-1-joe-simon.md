Woah yeah
You got me doin' the moon walk
You got me doin' the moon walk
It's just a matter of time
Before you blow my mind
You got me, woah, doin' the moon walk

Listen baby
I can't stop myself from lovin' you
I can't stop myself from lovin' you
Please hear my cry
And never say goodbye
I can't stop myself from lovin' you
Woah yeah

You got me doin' the moon walk, girl
You got me doin' the moon walk
It's just a matter of time
Before you blow my mind
You got me, woah, doin' the moon walk

Blow your horn brother, play
Oh yeah

You got me doin' the moon walk, girl
You got me doin' the moon walk
It's just a matter of time
Before you blow my mind
You got me, woah, doin' the moon walk

I can do it like this
Just walk along and bounce
Kinda shake a little bit
Every once in a while
Move out on the right foot
Then the left
You understand?
Now we're gonna do it one more time
I want you to join in and help me
Alright, here we go
Right foot
Left
Here come some rocks
A little of that moon dust
Put it in your bag
Walk on home with it now

Ohhh, baby
I'm doin' the moon walk
You got me, woah, doin' the moon walk

Now everybody can do the moon walk
All in the arms
You just walk along, and you kinda bounce
You know what I'm talkin' about
You get that feelin'
You gotta shake it a little bit
Alright now
Let's do it one more time
Are you ready
Alright, here we go, hmmm
Right foot
Left
Pick up some rocks
A little of that moon dust
Put it in your bag
Walk on home with it now
Woah yeah
Look like old Tim wanna do it
Come on man
Come on Mr DJ, lemme see ya
Oh yeah
Everybody do your own thing now
You got the best instructions, that's all ya need

Oh yeah
Now lemme tell ya what I'm gonna do
Ahhh, I'm gonna do it so
I'm gonna do it, baby, 'til I reach my goal
Ohh, my love, I'm doin' the moon walk
Oh yeah, hmmm
Woah yeah, hmmm
Woah baby

I tell ya what
I just want you to do it with me one more time
Just one more time
Ahhh yes
I don't have to tell you how to do it no more
You got it now
I'm just gonna be quiet a while
And sit back and let my hair blow
And listen to my brother Ray kinda
Sow that saxophone for ya
Go ahead on Ray

Come on back
You don't even know the words
Ha ha ha, woah!
