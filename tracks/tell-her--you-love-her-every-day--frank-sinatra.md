Tell her you love her each day
You'll make her happy that way
A simple "I love you" means more than money
And with a kiss or two her life is sunny

Give her a reason to live
She needs the love that you give
Always remember that is what she lives for

She hopes you love her
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her --
Today!

Chorus:
Give her a reason to live
She needs the love that you give

Always remember that is what she lives for

She hopes you love her
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her --
Today!
