As the Sun goes is sinking
Deep in the west, the day makes an end
That's when love is stealing
Around every corner, around every bend

Falling for temptation
Well, I've already made that very mistake
She puts an offer to me
Too good to refuse, it's easy to take

So what can I do about it, girl?
Guess that's the way it's meant to be
And if you should want to go
I wouldn't make you stay
You know I don't care about tomorrow
When tonight you're on my side
Hoping this time around
We make it all the way
All the way

The taste is sweet sensation
It's all that I want
It's all that we need
Now we're getting that hesitation
When you tell me you're true
It's hard to believe

Too much cool deception
Oh, it goes through my head, it's always the same
Making eyes is cheating
And the very first kiss is where it begins

So what can I do about it, girl?
Guess that's the way it's meant to be
And if you should want to go
How could I make you stay
You know I don't care about tomorrow
When tonight you're on my side
Praying this time around
We make it all the way
The way to your heart

So the Sun is sinking
Deepin the red, the blade makes an end
Love comes stealing softly
Around every corner, around every bend

We're alway cheating
And the very first kiss is where we begin
Goes 'round every corner, around every bend
Lovin' it all the way to the end
