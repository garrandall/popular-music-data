Oh yes it's people like you make life worthwhile for people like me
And that's why people like me fall in love with people like you
It's such a good feeling to wake up and know
That somebody's heart goes wherever you go
That somebody's waiting with a sweet caress
To bring you happiness

Oh yes it's people like you who bring sunny skies to people like me
And that's why people like me lose their hearts to people like you

Life used to be lonely
No roses and wine
But now that's all over
Since you said you're mine
When somebody love you all at once you see
How beautiful life can be

Oh yes it's people like you make life worthwhile for people like me
And that's why people like me fall in love with people like you

Oh yes it's people like you make life worthwhile for people like me
And that's why people like me fall in love with people like you

Oh yes it's people like you make life worthwhile for people like me
And that's why people like me fall in love with people like you
