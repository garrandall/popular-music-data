Knuck if you buck boy
Knuck if you buck
Knuck if you buck
Knuck if you buck
Kn Kn Kn Kn Kn Kn
Knuck if you buck boy


Crime Mob ho, Crime Mob ho
Hey this ya boy Lil Scrappy,
"Tha Prince Of Crunk"
yea, Lil J on tha track nigga,
Ay its time for all security to get around
It's going down...


Yeah
Well I'ma gat totin' pistol holdin'
Nigga on yo damn street
Stompin jumpin bumpin
And get crunk off in this damn thang
Throwin dem bows up at dez hoes
They screamin they bleedin from they nose
But we start to swang we makin niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thang
We too deep off yo party
Crime mob niggas gettin started
Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
So if a nigga come and run his mouth just like a hoe
Punch em dead up in his nose
And stomp his ass down to the flo'


Yeah we knuckin and buckin and ready to fight
I betcha Im'a throw dem thangs
So haters best to think twice
See me I ain't nothin nice
And crime mob it ain't no stoppin'
They be like Sadaam Husein, Hitler and Osama Bin Laden
Like they steady gum poppin
And I am actin a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this crime mob crew
Now enough is enough boy
Rough and get stuffed boy
Luck is a must boy
Knuck if you buck boy



Jumpin off from on the stage
Throwin' bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas startin' riots
Knockin down the baracade
Ellenwood we be to deep
The M.O.B is to elite
Flawless lookin shawties
You'll be jawless gettin close to me
Bullets bustin constantly
Rammin through yo city streets
Broken bones laying long scattered across the concrete
Knuckin if u buckin you'll be duckin if u get too close
In my eyes you wasn't wise
I think its time I knuck you ho


I come in da club
Shakin my dreads, throwin dem bows
And bussin dez heads
Bitch you irrelevant come to my residence
Betsa back up for I leave you ellect
I been in drama and commiting a crime
Not leavin' a trace not leavin' a line
We knuckin and buckin cuz I got a nine
I blow you away cuz you wastin my time
Stupid ass niggas I know what to do
I waste yo ass you step to my crew
I'm through wit you haters so watch what you do
You talkin bout me then I'm talkin to you
You buckin on us and we leave you in plastic
You buckin on me and that shit gone get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing off hits
I shot at yo city but you cannot tell


Knuck if you buck boy
But you betta come equipped
I got some shit off in my trunk thats gonna make yo body flip hollow tip
Bussin off the rizo soon as a hit the do'
Anybody make a false move they body on the flo'
Fuckin wit no hoes boy neva been no lame main
Aint Neva seen no pussy niggas scared to throw dem thangs main
Crime mob niggas off in this bitch
Break bread records I represent
Fuckin wit them HB niggas you bout to get yo wig split
