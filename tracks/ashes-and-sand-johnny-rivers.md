These feelings have been building up
Around us for a long time
I remember days when your true lovin' ways
Flowed thru my life just like sweet wine
And lately you've been acting strange
You feel you need a change
There's nothing I can do to make you stay
So if you must say goodbye
This is as good a time as any for me to cry

How can they say that somehow
It all works out for the good
When life can be so cruel
You feel just like a fool, you know you should
What happened to our dreams, all our well laid schemes
We just let them slip right on thru our hands
And all that's left when the fire is gone
Is just some ashes and a little bit of sand.

So naive to think it could be sunshine all the way
Look out here comes a rainy day
You know, I'll always love you deep inside
And girl, I know you never lied to me
Oh there was a time we could fly so high
They couldn't catch us if they tried
They couldn't catch us if they tried
