Written on the blackboard
Of first period class
Written on the sidewalks
Of stores we pass

There is a banner
On our school grass
Says Judy loves me
Judy loves me

Judy loves me
Judy loves me
Disc jockeys say it
On the nighttime station

Here's one going out
With our next dedication
Johnny from Judy
My heart's sensation

Judy loves me
Judy loves me
Judy loves me
Judy loves me

She's so pretty
She's so fine
That's my Judy
That's my Judy

She's so pretty
She's all mine
Never thought she'd fall for me

Not so long ago I met her
Love was all I could see
She was wanted by all the guys
But now she's kissing me
Kissing me

So now when the weekend's coming
We're off to the drags or?
Others guys come with
Their hearts all undone

Cause Judy loves me
Judy loves me
Judy loves me
Judy loves me

(Judy, Judy, Judy loves me)
Judy really loves me
(Judy, Judy, Judy loves me)
And she's so proud of me
(Judy, Judy, Judy loves me)
You know she loves me
(Judy, Judy, Judy loves me)
You know she really loves me
