I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find the better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes
Some people get me wrong
When it's something
I've said or done

Sometimes
You feel
There is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now, truly realize
They don't wanna compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, yeah

Well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find the better day
I'm walking away

Well, I'm so tired, baby
Of things you say, you're driving me away, yeah
Whispers in the powder room, girl
Don't listen to the games they play

I thought you'd realize that I'm
Not like them other guys
I saw them with my own eyes
You shoulda be more wise, girl

Well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
To find a better day

I'm walking away
I'm walking away
I'm walking away
To find a better day
I'm walking away
