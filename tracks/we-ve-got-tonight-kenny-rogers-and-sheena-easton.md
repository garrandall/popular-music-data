I know it's late,
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?, no one will care girl
Look at the stars now so far away

We've got tonight,
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe
Why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today

So there it is girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?

We've got tonight,
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe
Why don't you stay?

I know it's late, i know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me

Still here we are,
Both of us lonely
Both of us lonely

We've got tonight,
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last,
Let's find a way
Turn out the light,
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe
Why don't you stay?

We've got tonight, babe
Why don't you stay?
