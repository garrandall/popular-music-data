Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me


I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour, and


Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me


Now through our years together
We have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong
That somehow we've carried on


And oh, how happy
(You have made me)
Oh, how happy
You have made me


Listen, you brought joy to my delight
And all that was wrong, you have made it right
And I love you, I love, I love, love


Oh, how happy
You have made me
(Oh yeah)
Oh, how happy
(Yes, you did, yeah, alright)
You have made me

Oh, how happy
(You have made me)
Oh, how happy
(You have made me)

Oh, how happy
You have made me
(You have made me)
You have made me
(You have made me)

You have made me
(You made me happy)
You have made me
(Yes, you did)

You have made me
(Oh, so happy, babe)
You have made me
(Yes, you did)
You have made me
