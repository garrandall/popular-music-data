I live out yonder where the snakes and scorpions run 
Got myself a little goldmine to bank on 
But one day my heart sank when I saw madame in town 
I knew her love would be the death of mine 

L'amour passait, l'amour obsolÃ¨te 
Pourquoi perdre sa vie Ã  chercher l'or d'un coeur? 
Je ne me noierai pas dans ce dÃ©sert mystique 
Je ferme mes comptes et je repars 
Love is passÃ© and love is obsolete 
Some spend their whole lives searching for a heart of gold 
I'm tired of treading water in this desert mystique 
I'm cashing in my chips before I ride 

Do me a favor while I'm hanging here 
Take this gold and go and hide 
(don't twist too hard darlin' on your hangin' rope) 
Don't worry I'll be free in no time 

She promised me she would be there when I'd return 
She didn't say she'd have a whole army there as well 
She whispered, "j'taime baby"; as she fired that gun at me 
(it's getting late and I'm running out of time) 
I should've stayed way out yonder 
Better off with the scorpions and snakes 
Every act which has no heart will be found out in the end 
Guess I'm a little late this time 
Cause her love would be the death of mine 
Mine, all mine.
