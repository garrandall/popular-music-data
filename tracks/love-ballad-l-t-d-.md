I
Have never been so much
In love
Before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice
So right


Loving you gave me something new
That I'd never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed
No, it's not the feeling I had before
Oh-oh-oh, it's much, much more


Love
I never knew that a touch
Could mean
So much
What a difference
And when we walk hand-in-hand
I feel
So real


Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks will say
Don't they know?
They're not there when you love me
Hold me and say you care


And what we have is much more than they could see
(Well, well, well, well, there's so much more now)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Well, well-e-ell, there's so much more, baby)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Well, there's so much, so much more)
What we have is much more than they could see
(I don't care what people say, I don't care what they say)
What we have is much more than they could see
(So, well it's, so, well it's)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Well, we've got so much more than they could see see)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Ah, hey, I say, what we have is so much more)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Ah, hey, love it, having so much more than they could see)
What we have is much more than they could see
(So much more, now, baby, say now)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Ohh, love having so much more than they could see)
What we have is much more than they...
