Well, oh well, I feel so good today
We just touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home from overseas to the USA

New York, Los Angeles, oh how I yearned for you
Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be back in Chuck Berry's old Saint Lou
(Let me hear it once more!)

Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway
From the coast of California to the shores of the Delaware Bay?
Well, you can bet your life I did till I got back in the USA
(Come on, boy!)

Lookin' hard for a drive-in, searchin' for a corner cafÃ©
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill, night and day
Yes, and a jukebox jumpin' with 'Welcome back in the USA'

I'm so glad I'm livin' in the USA
I'm so glad I'm livin' in the USA
Anything you want, they got it right here in the USA

I'm so glad I'm livin' in the USA
I'm so glad I'm livin' in the USA
Anything you want, they got it right here in the USA
