I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night in the ol' town hall
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down
Don'tcha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

The skeeters start buzzing 'bout this time o' year
I'm goin' round back, she said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

Hope ya'll know what I'm talkin' about
The way they wiggle that thing, it really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope ya'll are too
Well come-on a little closer, gonna do it to you

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

That I'm tired of payin' dues
Done said goodbye to all my blues
Lawdy mama light my fuse
