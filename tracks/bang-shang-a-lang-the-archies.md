I recall just walking down the street
Trying to escape the city heat
I saw her from the corner of my eye, eye, eye
Yes she looked so good I thought I'd die
My heart went bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang

Something said I shouldn't waste no time
If I'm ever gonna make her mine
I walked right up and say how do you do, do, do
She said I bet I do as good as you
My heart went bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang

I remember when I held her tight
Felt like holding dynamite now
What's that ringing in my ear
Tell me ain't those bells I hear
Bang, bang, shang a lang
Bang, bang, shang a lang
Bang, bang, bang
Shang a lang lang
Bang, bang, bang
Shang a lang, lang

Now she's gonna spend her life with me
Then we'll be as happy as can be
Because I love her more than I can tell, tell, tell
Sunday afternoon we'll hear the bells
And they'll go bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang
And they'll go bang shang a lang, bang shang a lang
Bang shang a lang, bang, bang
