There's something moving
In the air tonight
Something moving
At the speed of light
And it's calling
Calling, calling to you
I got a feeling
Rushing through my head
We might never get
This chance again
And it's calling, calling
Call to you, yeah
If the time should call
Should they'll find
What we believe
Then you can believe
I'm coming on
Like a mega force
Mega force
Like a mega force
There's a feeling
From inside the sun
There's a message
In the rock and roll
And it's calling, calling
Calling to you, yeah
Every night
Has got to compromise
There comes a time
To stand and fight
And it's all been
All been long overdue, yeah
I can't understand
But I've only been so far
Then you can believe
I'm coming on
Like a mega force
Mega force
Like a mega force
Oh, mega force
Mega force, yeah
Like a mega force
Calling out to you, oh
Calling out to you
Calling out to me
Mega force
Mega force
Coming on
Like a mega force
Coming on
Coming on
Like a mega force
