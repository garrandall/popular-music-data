They're tearing down the street
Where I grew up
Like pouring brandy
In a Dixie cup

They're paving concrete
On a part of me
No trial for killing off
A memory

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came

No sidewalk playground now
To meet my friends
They put a roadblock
At the rainbow's end

We're driving faster now
Than Orville flew
We leave our mark on
Every single thing we do

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the way the West was won
Amos and Andy and nickel candy
Have fallen to the gun

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the way the West was won
Amos and Andy and nickel candy
Have fallen to the gun

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
