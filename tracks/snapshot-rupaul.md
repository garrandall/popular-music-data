I want you to remember me...

I want you to remember me (I, I)
I want you to remember me (I, I, I)
I want you to remember me (I, I)
I want you to remember me (I, I)
Snapshot
I, I, I

I want you to, I want you to
I, I, I want you to, I want you to
I, I, I want you to, I want you to
I want you to remember

I, I, I want you to, I want you to
I, I, I want you to, I want you to
I, I, I want you to, I want you to
I want you to remember (remember)...

Snapshot, red hot (oh)
Snapshot, red hot (oh, eh, eh)
Snapshot, red hot (oh)
Snapshot, red hot

I want you to remember me being who I wanna be
Turn it on, then you'll see everybody look at me
I want you to remember me being who I wanna be
Turn it on, then you'll see
Snapshot, red hot
I, I, I

Snapshot, red hot (oh)
