Don't do no drugs
Ain't got the time
I keep it straight
But I don't mid
Cause I got love
That the only plan
I'm just a satisfied man.

Ain't no girl
Can turn my head
Cause I got better
Waitin' on the bed
She does it all
Everything will wait
Makes me a satisfied man.


Oohh I'm so satisfied
Yea I'm so satisfied
Oohh I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man.
In the world
That's falling down
We'll be together
No one else around
Face to face
Right to the end
Though I'm a satisfied man.


Oohh I'm so satisfied
Yea I'm so satisfied
Oohh I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man.

She keeps it comin'
Keeps it comin'
Keeps me goin'
Every night or every day
She keeps it goin'
Keeps it goin'
Every night for every way

In the world
That's falling down
We'll be together
No one else around
Face to face
Right to the end
Though, I'm a satisfied man.

Oh baby, make no mistake about it
I'm a satisfied man
Baby, everything you say
Everything you do
Satisfied man
Everything you do is sooo right
Satisfied man.

Oohh I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man

Oohh yea I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man

Oohh I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man

Satisfied man
Satisfied man
Satisfied man
Satisfied man
Satisfied man
Satisfied man
Satisfied man
I'm a satisfied man.
