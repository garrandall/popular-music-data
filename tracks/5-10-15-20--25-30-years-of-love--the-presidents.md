The Presidents
(Boyd/Powell)
As found on Soul Hits Of The 70's, Vol. 3
Lasting forever now
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Aren't we happy
Look at the little kids playing
And having fun
Don't they remind you of us
When we were young
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 years ago)
Weren't we happy
And we have so much to be thankful for
We've got
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Holding hands and talking
Walking in the park
Aren't we happy
Watching the kids play
Girl, brings memories to our hearts
Aren't we happy
And here I cry out
Thank you for giving me
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Aren't we happy
Thank you for
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Aren't we happy
Lasting forever now
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Aren't we happy
5 -10 -15 - 20 (25 - 30 Years Of Love)
Aren't we happy?
