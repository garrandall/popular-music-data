I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you

I got up, I go to work
I try real hard to do my job
But before the day is done
I find out I done something wrong

I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
Days are getting longer and
My nights are getting shorter
And my way gets darker
And my work gets harder

Now when I get home
The wife is mad
The little girl
She's feeling bad

Little junior
He's got the blues
Says he needs a
Pair of baseball shoes

I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
Days are getting longer and
My nights are getting shorter
And my way gets darker
And my work gets harder

Now in everything that I do
I'm trying to make
One dream come true

And maybe someday
Lord, I'll find
Satisfaction and
Peace of mind

I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
I'm a telling you
Days are getting longer and
My nights are getting shorter
And my way gets darker
And my work gets harder
