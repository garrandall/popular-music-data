I used to pride myself on being the other man 
But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man 
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering 
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing 
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again 
Even flipped out on me at the mall again 
"it's all his fault again" that's what u telling all ya friends 
I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again 
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya 
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya 
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya 
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause 


When we laugh or we cry it's together 
Through the rain and the stormiest weather 
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever 


Won't you come on and go with me 
Come on ova to my place 
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat 
And let me ease ya mind girl 
We gon do it our way 

I heard your friend told a friend that told a friend of mine 
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time 
If this aint the truth then hopefully it's not a lie 
Cause I aint got no issue's with hitting at another time 
We never had a problem gettin it done 
Disagreed upon a lot ma but the sex wasn't one 
Now check it I know u get excited (still) when I come round and bite it (girl)
Quit frowin up and quit actin like you don't like 

I like it, I like it, I really, really like it, I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it 


When we laugh or we cry it's together 
Through the rain and the stormiest weather 
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever 


Won't you come on and go with me 
Come on ova to my place 
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat 
And let me ease ya mind girl 
We gon do it our way 

Shawty where u been 
Feels like a long time, long, long time since I seen ya 
Yes it has girl, when I know I said some fucked up things to u before 
But girl u know I didn't mean it 
(I didn't mean one single word) 
(I never meant one single word) 
If I could take back every word I would and more fo sho 
If I thought that you believe it 
Cause you make my life so convenient for me


When we laugh or we cry it's together 
Through the rain and the stormiest weather 
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever 


Won't you come on and go with me 
Come on ova to my place 
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat 
And let me ease ya mind girl 
We gon do it our way
