Now the year has come to a close
And I've had my last dance with you
Unto the empty streets we go
And this might be my last chance with you

So I might as well get it over
'Cause the things I've got to say won't wait until another day

You're a lady
I'm a man
You're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be

You're romantic
I'm a fool
You're the teacher
I've come to school
Here I sit
And hope that you'll love me

You're all magic
Unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
So I say with no restrain
Be mine, oh be mine

Hard to answer, yes, I agree
But then I've got to know
I'm not asking you to marry me
Just a little love to show

Oh I know I could make you happy
So the things I have to say
Won't wait until another day

You're a lady
I'm a man
You're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be

You're romantic
I'm a fool
You're the teacher
I've come to school
Here I sit
And hope that you'll love me

You're all magic
Unlock my chain
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
So I say with no restrain
Be mine, oh be mine
