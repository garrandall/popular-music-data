In times when you're troubled
Seems more than you can afford
And you feel, you feel you need a friend
Someone to share the load

And when your skies grow cloudy
I want you to know got a friend that's true
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do

When your dreams are scattered
Just like the wind blown sand
And you feel, you feel you need a friend
I'll be there, reach out your hand

And when the tempest is raging
I want you to know got a friend that's true
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do

I'll see you through your bad times
I'll see you through your fears
I'll see you through your hang ups
Honey I'll dry all your tears

And when the tempest is raging
I want you to know got a friend that's true
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do

I will see you through, I will see you through
I will see you through, I will see you through

When my load got heavy, did you see me through
When my load got to hard to bear, did you see me through
What would you do, what would you do
What would you do, what would you do

If you're living on the dole and there's no sugar in your bowl
All you need to do is give a little knock
Don't despair he'll be there with his loving and his care
Marx will work for us right around the clock

He's alright, he's alright
He's alright, he's alright
