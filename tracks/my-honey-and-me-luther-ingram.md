Oh, my honey and me
Hold us together
My honey and me
We're stuck together
Forever and ever

A young boy and
A fine young girl
Making love and that's
The most magnificent
Freeing kind of feeling
As beautiful as heaven above

That's the way
It's supposed to be
Loving deeper than
The deep blue sea

Me and my honey
My honey and me

I'm just a happy fellow
Feeling fine and mellow
Sunny days or showers
We're making love
For Hours and hours

Night time or day time
Tight, as close as one
Just two lucky people
Smiling through the struggle
The game of love sure is fun

It's as key as one, two, three
Loving deeper than
The deep blue sea
Me and my honey
My honey and me

Me and my honey
My honey and me
Me and my honey
My honey and me

Oh, my honey and me
Hold us together
My honey and me
We're stuck together
Forever and ever

A young boy and
A fine young girl
Making love and that's
The most magnificent
Freeing kind of feeling
As beautiful as heaven above

That's the way
It's supposed to be
Loving deeper than
The deep blue sea, uh huh

Me and my honey
My honey and me

Making love, stuck together
Feeling love, my honey and me
Now it's day time, close as one
Making love is so much fun

Sunshine or showers
Making love for hours
Ooo wee, my honey and me

My honey and me
Making love, making love...
