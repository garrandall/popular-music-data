I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone


I buy time in Switzerland, I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty I make songs that monarchs know
Ti ti ti la so fa, mi mi mi mi re do
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I need that dollar yo
Hic-hic-hiccup, blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up now I’m balling like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of "Nip Tuck"
And yes I am the best man, I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up


Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill, you know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough


I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone


But I won't be gone for too long


In Amsterdam, haha, and Milan
Just came off Aussie tour, you’ll never see this singer poor
I’m the one like 2 plus 3, m-m-m-minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum, every time I climb the stalk
Yeh, yeh, I’m on it, I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver peace sign on my bonnet
You don’t need a thermometer to tell you who’s the hottest
Ip dip do motherfucker, you are not it


Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill, you know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough


I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone


But I won't be gone for too long


Okay I’m in it, I’m in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit
Got some friends that playing football
And some friends that playing cricket
And a mistress that is fine like a fucking parking ticket
Haha, I said I’m in it, I’m in it 'til the finish
I keep them bottles coming 'til there ain't nothing in it
I’m like Mario on mushrooms, I’m like Popeye on some spinach
We gon keep it coming 'til I no speaka no English, ah!


I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone


But I won't be gone for too long
