Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can feel your halo


And don't it feel good!

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo (I'm walking on sunshine, woah)
I can see your halo halo halo (I'm walking on sunshine, woah)

And don't it feel good!

I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door


Oh now now!


I'm walking on sunshine, woah!
I'm walking on sunshine, woah!
I'm walking on sunshine, woah ohoh!
And don't it feel good!

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo


I can see your halo
HALO!
