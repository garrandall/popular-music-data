Don't want another man loving you
Cause too many cooks
Can spoil the soup

I know your love is boiling hot
Don't want another man
Putting his spoon in the pot

You know your love is
Finger licking good to me
Don't want another man
Changing my recipe

Don't want another man loving you
Cause too many cooks
Sure does spoil the soup

Don't change it
Don't let nobody change it

Cause you got just enough sugar
Just enough spice
You got the ingredients
To make your love just right

Don't let another man
Stick his fingers in the pot
Cause that might change the
Good, good loving we got

Don't want you to try nobody new
Cause too many cooks
Hey, hey, spoil the soup

This world ain't big enough
For his loving too
Cause too many cooks
Hey, now, spoil the soup

Don't change it
Don't let nobody change it
Don't change it
Don't let nobody change it
Hey, hey

Every time I see you
You've learned something new
Wonder who's teaching you
To do the things you do

Don't want nobody
Drinking from my loving cup
Don't wanna see you
Ever change it up

Don't change it
Don't let nobody change it

Honey, honey
You know the season
Just right for me
Don't want another man
Changing the recipe

Don't want another man loving you
Cause too many cooks
Hey, spoil the soup
