This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart
Poured it in the ground
Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves
And spins round and round


I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talkin' to me
And be there when
I feed the tree


This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs
They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silver tooth, she grins and wins


I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talkin' to me
And be there when
I feed the tree


This old man I used to be
Spins around, around
Around the tree
Silver baby, come to me
I'll only hurt you
In my dreams


I know all this and more
So take your hat off boy
When you're talkin' to me
And be there when
I feed the tree
