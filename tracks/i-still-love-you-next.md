Yeah, nine eight, ya'll, R.L.
Tweety, teelo, (I, ah ah ah ah, I still love you)
Destination platinum, baby
Remix...

Next up, yo I believe that's me
Lifestyle espinoza, chance flows up with the first Jahova
The Casinova, the neck brownic like Lex Luger
Me, Lex and Q, we used roll up and jancin over
Now the stretch - a roaster, got an extra sofa
You were always there, had my back
Even before I was the first latin a rapper to ever come home with a platinum plaque
I regret, gettin u back cuz I want you back
Show a thug some love, baby holler back

From demos to limos, nj 900 to timbo
Gable access to lino, you stay by my side
You kept the faith, You wouldn't break
You kept me safe and held me straight
You're so important in my life

I still love you, babe
Cuz without you there's no me
I'm still for you, girl
Even though we disagree sometimes
I'll never leave you baby
(I'll never leave you baby)
Cuz I realize I need you in my life

Girl everytime I close my eyes
And every moment that I rise
I don't ever wanna say "goodbye"
When in my brain, my body lies
I still love you

When u get mad, bus pass for laughs
Hot rods and bus padders is all we had
That can never change
From government askin
To government taxin
Credit? forget it
To credit maxin, now we laughin
Yo, my love will stay the same

My material girl in this material world
I've been givin you pearls since you were just a little girl
Shirley Temple, you look so pretty wit yo little dimples
Yo ---, Now I got u ready to flip your nipples
While you pinch your nipples, to feel a little independant
I'm glad you did it, hunny, the money's there
Go head and spend it, you represen'ed since the beginning
So if I cheat on you with other women, I promise to hit da box in 'em

I, ah ah ah ah, I still love you
