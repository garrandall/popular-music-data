Hm, closer
I wanna be closer to you

(I like to get close)
Closer
(I like to get close)
Like to be close to you, baby
(I like to get close
To the one I love)

Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

My girl, she asked me
How come I don't do the boogaloo
(Boogaloo)
I told her, baby
'Cause I can't get close
Enough to you
(Close to you)
(Closer, closer)

I told her
That's the only dance
That I like to do
It's a dance
I can hold her yet
Steal a little kiss or two

Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

My girl
She asked me out to the party
Her friends told her
That I was a drag (drag)
Just because I don't do the dance
The way they want me to
Can't they see
That I'm in a different bag

Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

Oh, hold me close
Hold me closer to you
And all you got to do
Is squeeze me, baby
And hold me closer to you

Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
