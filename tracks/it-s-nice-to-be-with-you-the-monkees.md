Hey!
Look what you have done
Showing me the sun
And now it's shining through
It's nice to be with you

Hey!
I like the things you say
And I like the way
You do the things you do
It's nice to be with you

Each time that I give my heart to someone new
They just turn it blue
But this time
Is my time
And my time
Is all the time I have
To be with you
So please
Never go away
Say you're going to stay
And make my dreams come true
It's nice to be with you

Each time that I give my heart to someone new
They just turn it blue
But this time
Is my time
And my time
Is all the time I have
To be with you
So please
Never go away
Say you're going to stay
And make my dreams come true
It's so nice to be with you
