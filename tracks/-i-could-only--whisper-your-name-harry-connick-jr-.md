Somebody was spreading rumors
'Bout better days a comin
Why was I hummin
As if I knew
One and the same
But I just whispered your name

Somebody was sayin something
'Bout there being an end to tyranny
But when they asked me
What would I do...
If that day came
I only whispered your name

Everyone got their own opinion
And protects their own dominion
No doubt for them it's true
But I tell them what I really believe
My only worry is protecting you

No one should ever be lonely
We'd all find somebody to care
Ask me if I dare
To answer who...
Could carry that flame
I'd just whisper your name
