Oh oh..

High on a hill
Where troubles were few
High on a hill
By our old rendezvous

Here am I, I can't go on
Since you're gone (you're gone)
Since you're gone (you're gone)
You're gone and I'm alone

We made a vow
We never would part
You held your hand
So close to my heart

How could I know
How could I believe
You would leave me this way

All my dreams
All my schemes
Have lost their glow
Since you're away

What can I do
Is there still a chance
To have you (to have you)
To hold you (to hold you)
To love you forevermore

High on a hill
I'm begging to you
You were my life
I need you, I do

Till you come back to me
Here I will be
High on a hill
High on a hill

Oh oh..
