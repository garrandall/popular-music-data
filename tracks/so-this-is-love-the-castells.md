So this is love... real love
And it's like Paradise.oh yes
Really a paradise...
For you and for me...

So this is love.real love.
And it's so wonderful. oh yes.
Even more wonderful.
Than I thought it could be...

Not long ago I didn't know.
What this thing called love was about.
Now that you're here, now that you're near.
Each beat of my heart cries out, so...

This is love... real love
And it's so heavenly... oh yes.
It's very plain to see
We're really in love.

MUSICAL INTERLUDE

Oh yes, so this is love...
Oh yes, so this is love...
