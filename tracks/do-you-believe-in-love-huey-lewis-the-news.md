I was walking
Down a one-way street
Just a-looking
For someone to meet
One woman
Who was looking for a man

Now I'm hoping (hoping)
That the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering)
If you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming
(I don't wanna be lonely)
(Baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh, you're making me believe it, too

Now the feeling
Is beginning to grow
And the meaning
Is something you only know
If you believe it
Take my hand
And I'll take your heart, come on

Now I wonder (wonder)
Where does true love begin
I'm going under (under)
So I'm lettin' you in
My woman
(I don't wanna be lonely)
(Baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh, you're making me believe it, too

I used to have you in a photograph
I'm so glad it's changed
But now I've got you and it's gonna last
Do you believe in love

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
(I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
Do you believe in love
Oh, you're making me believe it, too

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
I believe in love, too
