Blue guitar
Fortune of my ways
Making of my days
New chord
Counting up the ways
Happiness is lazy

If you don't know the song
If you can't put the words to the tune
Tell the rhyme from the reason
What should it matter
To the fool or the dreamer?

New hope
Travelers in a storm
Finding love is warm
New day
The world has just begun
Our eyes have seen the sun

If you don't know the way
If you can't see the wood for the trees
Taste the wine from the water
Well, what should it matter
To the fool or the dreamer?
