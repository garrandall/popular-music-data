Oh hear me now

I don't want much
I just want a little bit
No, I don't want it all, no no
I just want a little bit
Give me a eeny weeny bit
Just a teeny weeny bit of your love

Turn your light down low, oh baby
Kind of slip me a kiss
Turn your light down low right now
I just can't resist
From a teeny weeny bit
Just a eeny weeny bit of your love

Oh yeah, come on now
Oh my goodness, it's all right
Ooh wee baby, yeah
I tell you I need it
Ooh wee, girl, yeah
Oh come on, all right, baby
I tell you rt's all right
Right, right now
Give me a eeny weeny bit
Oh a teeny weeny bit of your love

Listen

I want you forever, yes I do
Not just for peace of mind
Please say you'll never
You'll never leave me
Now till the end of time
Gotta have a teeny weeny bit
Oh a eeny weeny bit of your love

Give me a teeny weeny bit
Oh a eeny weeny bit of your love

Oh I tell you I need it, oh baby
I've got to have tt
Won't you give it to me right now...
