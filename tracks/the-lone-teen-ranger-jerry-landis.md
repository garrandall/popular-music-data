Hiyo Silver, away.
(Nonsense syllables)
There goes the Lone Teen Ranger

Oh, he rides around on a big white horse,
He's as cool as he can be.
And my baby fell in love with him
When she saw him on TV.
And since that day I'm sorry to say
She hasn't had time for me,
Cause he goes "bang, bang,"
He's the Lone Teen Ranger.

(Nonsense syllables)
Hiyo Silver, away
(Nonsense syllables)
There goes the Lone Teen Ranger

To save my soul I can't get a date
And you know who's to blame.
Since the Lone Teen Ranger came around
My girlfriend's not the same.
She even kissed the TV set
Oh, it's a cryin' shame,
Cause he goes "bang, bang,"
He's the Lone Teen Ranger.

Every night at eight o'clock she turns on the TV.
The Lone Teen Ranger stole my girl,
(He left Tonto for me.)
Well he better watch out cause I'm gettin' mad,
And here's what I'm gonna do.
Gonna wear a mask and ride a horse
And carry a six gun, too.
And when my baby looks at me
She's gonna love me, too,
Cause I'll go "bang, bang"
He's the Lone Teen Ranger.

Hiyo Silver, there he goes,
He's the Lone Teen Ranger.
(Who was that masked man?)
(You don't know? That's the Lone Teen Ranger!)
