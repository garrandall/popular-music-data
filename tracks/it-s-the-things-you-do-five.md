It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothing left to prove
It's the things you do

You touched my love line so deep inside I
Never thought I'd feel so good
Oh no. No need to hide now
Open up your mind now
Let me make it understood because

Nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me fill you up

It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothing left to prove
It's the things you do

You and me baby like the ABC K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Could it be unity I need like J Hoffa
Romance your body work it out - MM proper
One of the finest things on my mind is
Now you make me feel like gold your queen Midas
Straight A plus the material I bust
It's the things that you do
Keep me up and it's a must

Nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me fill you up

It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothing left to prove
It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothing left to prove
Give me a chance and let me in
There's no need to hide what's there within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me fill you up
You got that Midas touch
I love you more than enough
For all the things that you do
It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothing left to prove
It's the things you do
