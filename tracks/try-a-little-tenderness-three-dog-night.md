Oh, she may be weary
Young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old funky dress
But, oh while she gets weary weary
Won't you try some tenâ€”tenderness

You know she's there waitin'
And anticipatin'
For the thing she'll never, never have
Oh, no no
Oh, while she gets weary
Won't you try, oh, try some tenderness
Mmm hm

And I know it, hah
Sentimental no no, ah
She had, Lord, she had her grief and cares
But when ah, ha girl
Soft words were spoken
Made it easier, easy girl, easier to bear

You know you won't regret it, no ah
Young girls they don't forget it
Lovin' the same old, same old happiness, yeah, ha yeah
Oh, while she gets weary weary
Won't you try, oh, try some tenderness
I feel good, Lord, in the mornin'

You've got to hold her, squeeze her
Never leave her
You got to, you got to
You got to try some tenderness
I feel good, yeah
I feel good, Lord, ow yeah

You got to hold her, squeeze her
Never leave her
You got to, got to, yeah, you got to
Try now try, try, try, try some tenderness
In the morning you'll feel good, whoa

You got to hold her, squeeze her
Never leave her
Sock it to me, sock it to me one more time
You've got to help me
I feel good, Lord

You got to hold her, squeeze her
Never leave her
