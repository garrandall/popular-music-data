When you find out you don't love her
When all the glitter rubs off of her
I'll be waiting just a smile away

I can see you need some cheering
Call on me, I'm volunteering
All you gotta do is pick up the phone
Tell me you're alone and baby I'll come running

I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll turn your nighttime into day
I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll wash your troubles all away

When you need someone to laugh with
Someone to share things half and half with
I can make the nighttime fly away

You don't have to say you love me
Just let me know you're thinking of me
All you gotta do is pick up the phone
Tell me you're alone and baby I'll come running

I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll turn your nighttime into day
I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll wash your troubles all away
