Shine on me sunshine, walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl
In the whole U.S.A

Good morning morning, hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed
Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you

You make the coffee, I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch and you fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny
Honey it's almost nine
Now you be careful, gotta go, I love you
Have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl
In the whole U.S.A

Skippidity do da thank you oh Lord
For making him for me
And thank you for making life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm happiest girl
In the whole U.S.A

Oh shine on me sunshine, walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl
In the whole U.S.A

Shine on me sunshine, walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl
In the whole U.S.A
