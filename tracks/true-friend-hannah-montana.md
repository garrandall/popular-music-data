We sign our cards and letters BFF
You've got a million ways to make me laugh
You're lookin' out for me; you've got my back
It's so good to have you around

You know the secrets I could never tell
And when I'm quiet you break through my shell
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell
'Cause you keep my feet on the ground

You're a true friend
You're here 'til the end
You pull me aside
When something ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
'Til it's alright again
You're a true friend

You don't get angry when I change the plans
Somehow you're never out of second chances
Won't say "I told you" when I'm wrong again
I'm so lucky that I've found

A true friend
You're here 'til the end
You pull me aside
When something ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
'Til it's alright again

True friends will go to the end of the earth
'Til they find the things you need
Friends hang on through the ups and the downs
'Cause they've got someone to believe in

A true friend
You're here 'til the end
You pull me aside
When something ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
No need to pretend
(You're a true friend)

You're a true friend
You're here 'til the end
You pull me aside
When something ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
'Til it's alright again

You're a true friend
You're a true friend
You're a true friend
