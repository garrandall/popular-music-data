My love, been such a long, long time
One day I always knew I'd hear from you again
But I'm sorry to find you're havin' such hard times
But you thought of me in your time of need, so I say

Build me a road, dear, and I will come runnin'
No matter how long or how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
I promise I'll be there whenever you need

Who thought it would ever come to this
One last letter with no one last kiss
As the seasons go by, every day you're on my mind, baby
I long one day to be with you, so I say

Build me a road, dear (Oh, yes), and I will come runnin' (I'll come runnin')
No matter how long or (How) how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
(I promise) I promise (I'll be there) I'll be there whenever you need

You promised me, I promised you
The love for one another was true
But somewhere in time we went on with our lives
Now we're, oh, so far apart, too far to make a start
Too long to make it end, I must see you again

Build me a road, dear, and I will come runnin'
No matter how long (No matter) or how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
I promise I'll be there (Hey...) whenever you need

Where ever you are
Where ever you are, mmm...yeah
Where ever you are
Where ever you are, mmm

Hoo...hm
Hoo...hoo...oh..
Oh...oh...oh.ohoh
Oh...yeah
Hoo...oh..
