I'll take good care of you
I'll take good care of you

I let you go, for what a fool I was
To hurt you so but now I know

All of the good times, big city sights
I had enough of bright party lights
They'll never make up
For long, lonely nights

'Cause I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you and I promise that

I'll take good care of you
I'll take good care of you

Ain't it a crime
I know I've wasted
So much precious time
So much precious time

You gave me real love, beautiful poems
But I gave you nothing but heartache and pain
Baby, believe me, It won't happen again

'Cause I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you and I promise that

I'll take good care of you
I'll take good care of you

Let me take away the pain, babe
I need you
And let me hide those teardrops
I need you

You know every day and every night
I need you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna stand by you

And I'll take good care of you
I'll take good care of you
I'll take good care of you
