I was bruised and battered
And I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself

See my reflection in a window
And I don't know my own face
Oh brother, please don't leave me wastin' away
On the streets of Philadelphia...

I walk this avenue
'til my legs feel like stone
I hear the voices of friends vanished and gone

At night I can hear the blood
Runnin' through my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia...
Philadelphia...

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
These clothes, they don't fit me anymore
I've walked a thousand miles and I wanna slip this skin

Night has fallen 
And I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away

So receive me brother
With your faithful kiss
Or we will leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia...
Philadelphia...
