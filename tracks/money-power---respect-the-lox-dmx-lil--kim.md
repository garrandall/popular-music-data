See I believe in money, power, and respect.
First You get the money.
Then you get the muthafuckin, power.
After you get the fuckin' power muthafuckas will respect you.


It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.
Money, power, and respect.
Help you sleep at night.
You'll see the light.
It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.
Money, power, and respect.
Money, power, and respect.
Money, power, and respect.


Ayo my whole clique bout it, bout it.
We take yours while you pout about it.
Truck, step out the whore's wanna' crowd around it.
You could see me on optimum TV.
Go in your bathroom turn the light out. Scream!
Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3.
Sheek ain't your usual friend.
About to setchu' up like Kaiser and walk straight at the end.
I'm done wit' ice and charms.
I'm tryin' my whole casket when I'm gone.
Pull up wit' class on the don'.
Once I meet em' I greet em'.
Kiss his feet for freedom.
Tell em' thank you lord.
Cuz on Earth I was gettin' bored.
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek.
So I can make this album.
And get back the cats that's weak.
Two thirty, six two.
Me bust for you that's like a cat vs. a pitbull.
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger.
And plan for the future, cuz you figure
you gon' be older
way longer than you gon' be younger.


It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.

Only time could tell how the clock ticks.
I'm really loved here but I'm still a hostage.
Two personalities check the posture.
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils.
You think of death but the life seem scary.
I'm past the graveyard seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin til' I'm out parachutin'.
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds.
Twenty five thousand a piece.
Fuck streets!
Tryin' to own the island.
Forget about wilin'.
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'.
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'.
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English.
Wake up in Trinidad, like fuckin' em rich.
Come back. Private jet
live on set.
If you could shit gold like you split the decks.


It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.
Money, power, and respect.
Help you sleep at night.
You'll see the light.
It's the key to life.

Yo nutin' but the hotness.
Whenever we drop this.
Monotonous for ya'll to keep hatin',
cuz ya'll never gon' stop us.
I keep my rocks spotless,
and my hoes topless.
Take time try to figure out who da Lox is.
Fear no one.
Kick rhymes like Shoguns.
You scared to blow one.
Get robbed wit' your own gun.
If I don't respect you I'm ah check you.
And if I don't kiss you I'm a peck you,
right before I wet' chu.
I sneeze on tracks and bless you.
I'm special.
And if you like workin' out,
then I'm gon' stretch you.
Husslin' is dead but we still get red.
Turn the spots in the bakeries to get back bread.
And ya'll said my monies spent.
But it's in the Bent'.
So when the feds come the dogs can't get a scent.
For my story, self-explanatory
that I'm the hottest thing on the street.
An' yall ain't got nutin' for me


It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.
Money, power, and respect.
Help you sleep at night.
You'll see the light.
It's the key to life.

Arf, arf.
This is a beat that I can freak to
just drop the reals.
Plus a nigga wit' the ill.
Ya'll niggas know my skills.
Ass from the grills get em' up,
split em' up, wet em' up.
And watch em' come get em' up,
Set em' up.
When you do dirt, you get dirt.
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt.
Step back like I did worse.
This ain't no fucking game.
You think I'm playin, till you layin.
To where? The junkyard decayin'.
Mom's at home prayin'
that chu comin' home.
But chu not, cuz you sittin up in the trunk
startin to rot.
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now Baby.
It's goin' down baby.
Git the full pound baby.
And let off up in a nigga,
especially if he think he bigga'
than my muthafuckin' trigga'.
Did I?
Can I get my?
Is it gone?
DMX represent for one time.
It's on.


It's the key to life.
Money, power, and respect.
Whatchu' need in life.
Money, power, and respect.
When you eatin' right.
Money, power, and respect.
Help you sleep at night.
You'll see the light.
It's the key to life.
