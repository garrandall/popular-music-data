Oh yeah, I've got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don't come home at night
But when you do, you always start a fight

But I can't be alone
I need you to come on home
I know you're messing around
But who the hell else is, is gonna hold me down?

I gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna oh oohohoh
To you, oh oh

Should I grab his cell, call this chick up
Start some shh, then hang up?
Or I should I be a lady?
Oh, maybe 'cause I wanna have his babies?
Oh yeah, yeah

'Cause I don't wanna be alone
I don't need to be on my own
But I love this man
But some things I just can't stand

I gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other half still believes

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna oh oohohoh
To you, oh oh

Should I pay you back
To see how you react?
To see if you react to my love, my love

I gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna oh oohohoh
To you, oh oh

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna oh oohohoh
To you, oh oh
