1, 2, 3


Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
A big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen


Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa


Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it


5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me

I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day


Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa


Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it


You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for, oh, oh, oh


I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
