Finn:
What I want you've got
It might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame (with New Directions: Eh Eh)
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Oh yeah!

Finn with New Directions harmonizing (Quinn with New Directions):
Well well you... (I can't go for that)
You make my dreams come true (I can't go for that, I can't go for that)
Well well well you (I can't go for that)
Oh yeah, you make (with New Directions: my dreams come) true

New Directions:
I can't go for that (Rory: Yeah, yeah)
I can't go for that

Rory and Tina:
On a night, when
Bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer

Finn and Tina:
I can laugh it in your face

Rory with New Directions:
Twist and shout my way out

Rory and Tina:
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me

Finn and Tina:
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah
Well 'cause you

Finn with New Directions harmonizing (Quinn with New Directions):
(I can't go for that)
You make (with New Directions: my dreams come) true
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)
Well well well you (I can't go for that)
Oh yeah, you make (with New Directions: my dreams) come true

New Directions:
I can't go for that
I can't go for that

Finn:
Oh, listen to this, ow!

Quinn:
Yeah!

Finn:
Oh oh oh oh

Quinn with New Directions Girls:
Chke-ch-bwa!

Finn and Quinn:
I'm down on my daydream
But that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know!
Yeah you!

Quinn with New Directions Girls (New Directions Boys):
I'll (I'll do anything)
That you want me to
(I-I-I'll) Do almost anything

Finn:
You make my dreams come true
(New Directions Boys: True)

Quinn with New Directions Girls (New Directions Boys):
I'll (I'll do anything) (Finn: Oh, yeah!)
That you want me to
(I-I-I'll) Do almost anything

Finn:
You make my dreams come true, oh!

Quinn:
I can't go for that

Finn with New Directions:
You make my dreams come true

Quinn (Finn):
I can't go for that (woah)
I can't go for that (oh)

Finn:
I've been waiting for, waiting for
(Quinn: I can't go for that)
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for

New Directions:
You make my dreams come true

Quinn (Finn):
I can't go for that (O-oh-oh-wao)
I can't go for that

Finn:
You make my dreams come true
