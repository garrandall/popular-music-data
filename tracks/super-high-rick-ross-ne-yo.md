Uh....uh....uh


From my nigga Diddy view, I think I see his vision too
Purple Rain, over Central Park, chillin' with my goons
Big Pop's & Sade's, Cirocs & Chardonnay
My Cassie's sassy, so my penthouse my balloon
We doin' it big, it's goin' down, 9/11
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a 911
I been tryna fuck for months, babygirl it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather
...We shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yea this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part
Uh, fuck the marketing, look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton


All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes... to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh)

Cuz we are.... we are.... super hiiiigh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

{Bring your sexy ass here baby}


I wanna buy my bitch every bag
and she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back
I wanna take my bitch around the globe
Hawaii, hand glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hoes
..Rare bottoms by the barrel
Pop the Giuseppe tags, like it's American Apparel
20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andele, andele, baby move fast
She drop it down and bring it back, I like that
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
so she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back




If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine


Women of a caliber
only seen in magazines and calendars
And I'm sitting with Miss October
cuz my birthday's in October
Strawberry and her RosÃ© on
I can see it in her eye, cuz she wink and she toast me
and later on we gonna mosy..
to a place where it's populated and get
durty


If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look


Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh)
Cuz we are, we are super high
ooh yeah, ooh yeah




What the fuck are they yellin' ?

Super hiiighhh
