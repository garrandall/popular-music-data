We gotta get it together (now) before it's too late
(What are we waiting for?)
We just can't sit by (no, we can't) and watch our love turn to hate
Doesn't really matter (no) whose fault it was


Love gonna pack up and walk out on us
Love gonna pack up and walk out on us


We act just like two kids and play
Get mad over something silly, take our toys away
It's too bad happiness don't grow on trees
That's why I gotta sacrifice for you, you gotta sacrifice for me
I gotta understand you, you gotta understand me
Doesn't really matter (no) whose fault it was




We got this one life to live, one love to give
Let's kiss song, this is my hug song
 together, let's love song
Face it, baby, pick up the pieces
(We gon' fall) back together again
(We gotta get it together)
Get it together or bye bye, love
