Woman Your Sweeter (Woman Your Sweeter)
Than The Honey Made By Bees (So Much Sweeter)
You To Me Girl (You To Me)
Like Soil Is To A Tree (So Much Sweeter)

You Say That You'd Be True
That You'd Never Leave Me
But Now Your Trying To Forget Me

Do Unto Me Girl
As You Have Me Do To You
Do Unto Me Girl
Now That You Know How I Love You

You Say That You (You Say That You)
Will Love Me
You Say That You (You Say That You)
Really Need Me

Every Time I Think That I Really Know You
Then You'd Come Along And Make Me Feel Blue

Do Unto Me Girl
As You Have Me Do To You
Come Back To Me Girl
Now That You Know How I Love You

Do Unto Me Girl
As You Have Me Do To You
Come Back To Me Girl
Now That You Know How I Love You

Do Unto Me Girl
As You Have Me Do To You
Come Back To Me Girl
Now That You Know How I Love You
