You have made the moment into happy hours
And in just that moment changed the rain cloud into flowers
And I can see that you're afraid
You think it's some kind of mistake that you made
Well, let me set your heart at ease
'Cause I'm down on my bended knees, sayin' to you

There's no time like the right time
And baby, the right time is now
(said that there's no time)
Like the right time, if you don't
Think that you can love me
You can bet I'm gonna show you how
You know I'm gonna show you how (hey!)

Every single second that you just let go
Multiply by a million, it just makes me want you that much more
You got me sittin' here countin' time
'Cause sooner or later you'll find
That a second's so much dearer than
A fifty-dollar bill
If you need someone to love you
Well you got someone who will, and

There's no time like the right time
And baby, the right time is now
(said that there's no time)
Like the right time, if you don't
Think that you can love me
You can bet I'm gonna show you how
You know I'm gonna show you how (hey!)

No time like the right time
Talkin' 'bout the right time
