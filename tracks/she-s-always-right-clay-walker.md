The wind was blowing through your hair
The moon was shing on your face
You looked like a picture sittin' there
And time stood still there in that place
The water was singin', out hearts were beatin' fast
Two high school lovers thinkin' it would always last

Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside

Now you're nothin' but a ghost
That still haunts my memory
And you're always waitin' there
When I go walkin' through my dreams
There's no happy ending but I know our love will last
'Cause when I close my eyes you always take me back

Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside

On a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside
