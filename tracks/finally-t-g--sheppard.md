I wish my mind wouldn't argue with my heart
It splits the day apart
Into time well spent, and time just thrown away
I wish my heart would please make up my mind
I'm wasting so much time
Gotta catch a glimpse of how it's gonna be

When finally, I look inside your eyes and see
Reflections of yourself in me
The way you always said it would be
When finally, I'm loving you like you love me
It happened oh so easily
I looked at you and it came to me
Finally

This Ferris wheel just keeps on spinning round
Playing mind games with the ground
Can we stop this time, or must we go again
I see you standing waiting just outside
Come and get me off this ride
Wanna lose myself in being here with you

When finally
I look inside your eyes and see
Reflections of yourself in me
The way you always said it would be
When finally
I'm loving you like you love me
It happened oh so easily
I looked at you and it came to me
Finally
