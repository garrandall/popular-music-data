Lately I've been trying
To fill up my days since you're gone.
The speed of love is blinding,
And I didn't know how to hold on.
My mind won't clear.
I'm out of tears.
My heart's got no room left inside.

How many dreams will end?
How long can I pretend?
How many times will love pass me by,
Until I find you again?

Will the arms of hope surround me?
Will time be a fairweather friend?
Should I call out to angels,
Or just drink myself sober again?
I can't hide, it's true.
I still burn for you.
Your memory just won't let me go.

How many dreams will end?
How long can I pretend?
How many times will love pass me by,
Until I find you again?

I'd hold you tighter,
Closer than ever before.
Yeah.
No flame would burn brighter,
If I could touch you once more,
Hold you once more!



How many dreams will end?
How long can I pretend?
How many times will love pass me by,
Till I find you again?
Till I find you again . . .
