If I could I'd try to know you
And I would never let you go, oh no!
But if I were to make you
A bit of time it would take to say, Someday

Anyone can see
What you mean to me
Anyone can tell I fell for you so easily

On the night when you left me
I cried wishing you would say you'd stay
Maybe I don't have the strength to
Tell you I need you so
I guess you'll never know

Anyone can see
What you mean to me
Anyone can tell (can tell)
I fell for you so easily

Anyone can see
What you mean to me
Anyone can tell (can tell)
My love for you
So easily
So easy

(Anyone, anyone, anyone
Anyone can see)
(Anyone, anyone, anyone
Anyone can see)
Anyone can see...
Anyone can see...
