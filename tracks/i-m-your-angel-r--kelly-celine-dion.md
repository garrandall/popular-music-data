No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah (ah)
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray
And then you will see the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
(Ah) I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time
Seek me and you shall find (ah)
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day
And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see?
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
(Is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
(Oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel (your angel)
And when all hope is gone, I'm here (hooo)
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky (hooo)
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
(I hear your voices) (I hear your voics)
I am your angel (yeah)
And when all hope is gone, I'm here (hooo) (hope is gone)
No matter how far you are, I'm near (far you are, I'm near)
It makes no difference who you are (I hear your voice)
I am your angel (your angel) (yeaheah) (ho yeah)
I'm your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky (cloud up in the sky yeah)
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
(Your shoulder to cry) (yeaheahyeah)
I hear your voices when you call me (ho yeah)
Hohoho hoho hohohoho
I'm your angel
