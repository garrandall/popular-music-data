If you wanna squeeze me a lot tonight
Call me and I'll make you feel alright
When you're out and running around
Playing games all over town

Turn around
Come on down
I'll be there, yeah, yeah

If you want a sweet, sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new you'll see
I can make your fire burn with a touch or just my kiss

Turn you on
All night long
You'll be gone, gone, gone!

Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (Yes, I am now, baby)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (I'm on fire, baby)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (Yes, I am on fire)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (I'm on fire, baby!)

If you want a sweet, sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new you'll see
I can make your fire burn with a touch or just my kiss

Turn you on
All night long
You'll be gone, gone, gone!

Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (Yes, I am now, baby)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (I'm on fire, baby)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (I'm coming, yeah, coming, baby)
Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire (I'm on fire, baby!)

Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire
