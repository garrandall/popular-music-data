You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way

Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true

You came upon a quiet day
You simply seemed to take your place
I knew that it would be that way
The minute that I saw your face

And when we've had a few more days (When we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (Wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (Be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked)

Today I said the time was right for me to follow you (Today, said that the time was right to follow you)
I knew I'd find you in a day or two (I knew that I would find you in a day or two)
And it's true

You didn't have to be so nice (Didn't have to be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked you anyway)
If you had just looked once or twice (Once or twice)
And gone upon your quiet way (Quiet way)
