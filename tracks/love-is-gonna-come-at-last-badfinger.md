There are times when it feels so hard just to carry on
There are times when the days all seem to be so long
Then this feeling inside of me sets me free from the past

And I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last

Been alone in a crowded room, watched it all go on
I've had so many sleepless nights when I dreamed alone
Then a break in the clouds above feels like love shinin' down

And I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come around
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come around

I live for tomorrow, what it may bring
I live through the sorrow
Live in my dreams, in my dreams



This feeling inside of me sets me free from the past
And someday I'll find a way to make my dreams come true

'Cause I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready, love is gonna come at last.
