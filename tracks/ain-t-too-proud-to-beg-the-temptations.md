I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me


Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go


Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side


Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go


If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can


Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go


Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door


Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave (don't leave) me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go


Baby, baby, baby, (ooh, sweet darlin')
Oh, no
Don't leave me girl, no, no
If crying keeps you near
I don't mind crying
Don't leave me girl, oh, no
Oh, baby
Don't leave me girl, no
Don't ever leave me
