Alright partner

You know what time it is

Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Ladies and gentlemen
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

Chocolate starfish

Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Now I know y'all be loving this shit right here
L.I.M.P Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
Cause if you don't care
Then we don't care
1 2 3 times two to the six
Jonesin' for your fix
Of that Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at punk
Shut the fuck up
And back the fuck up
While we fuck this track up

Throw your hands up

Now move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit (yeah)
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why)
Because we get it on (when?)
Every day and every night (oh)
And this platinum thing right here (uh huh)
Yo we're doin' it all the time (what)
So you better get some better beats
And a some better rhymes (dough)

We got the gang set
So don't complain yet
Twenty four seven never beggin' for a rain check
Old-school soldiers blastin' out the hot shit
That rock shit
Puttin' bounce in the mosh pit

Throw your hands up

Now move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Hey ladies hey fellas
And the people that don't give a fuck
All the lovers all the haters
And all the people that call themselves players
Hot mamas pimp daddies
And the people rollin' up in caddies
Hey rockers hip-hoppers
And everybody all around the world

Now move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Now move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what ya gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
