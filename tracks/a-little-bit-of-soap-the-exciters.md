A little bit of soap
Will washed away her lipstick on your face
A little bit of soap
Will never ever ever ever erase
The pain in my heart
And I and I know thru the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will nevet washed away my tears

A little bit of soap
Will washed away her powder on your cheek
A little bit of soap
Will never neverever ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
And I know through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never washed away my tears
