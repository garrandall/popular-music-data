Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?
Little alter boy, for I have gone astray
What must I do, to be holy like you?
Little alter boy, oh let me hear you pray

Little alter boy, I wonder could you ask our lord
Ask him, alter boy, to take my sins away
What must I do, to be holy like you?
Little alter boy, please let me hear you pray

Lift up your voice and send a prayer above
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love
Now I know my life has been all wrong
Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong

Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?
Could you tell our lord I'm going to change my way today?
What must I do, to be holy like you?
Little alter boy, oh let me hear you pray
Little alter boy, please let me hear you pray
