Say hold on, say hold on
Hold on, say hold on
Hold on, say hold on
Hold on, say hold on

I said hold on
? Are gone
There ain't no stoppin this train at all
There's a love song
That's pulling strong
No resistance when you hear the song
Can look and make you feel this way
'Cause I need your lovin' day to day
I wanna stay

With lovin' we can do
While seeing through
No stoppin' this love I got for you
And no way,?
Where is loving going to take us to today
Oh love, nothing makes me feel this way
You need a love to?
I wanna stay right by your side

You just keep holding on
Holding on
You just keep holding on
Holding on, holding on, holding on
