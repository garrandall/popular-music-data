Something's coming over me
I'm so dizzy I can't see
Can't make out the forest for the trees
My heart is beating faster now
As the traffic's slowing down
And suddenly I'm all alone with you
It's so good
Baby when you're at the wheel
I can't believe the way I feel
It's such a rush
Just being with you
Chorus
We're Driving in the Rush Hour
(ooh you send me)
You take me to the Rush Hour
You got me in the Rush Hour
Feel it getting hot in here
Feel me getting close to you dear
Slow motion moving you, moving me
Now your lips are touching mine
And in your eyes that certain shine
Honey, I know just where you're taking me
It's so good
Baby when you're at the wheel
I can't believe the way I feel
It's such a rush
Just being with you
Chorus
Chorus continues until fade out
