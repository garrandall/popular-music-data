Everybody knows you've been treating me bad
Everybody knows you've been makin' me sad
Well you don't have to lie 'cause I'm no fool
I can see you don't want my love at all
I know, I still love you
Everybody knows he's been hanging around
Everybody knows you've been painting the town
He could never love you the way that I do
And maybe I'll find somebody else
But oh, I still love you
Every night I keep on cryin'
And I pray that you'll stop lyin' to me
Everybody knows you will never be mine
Everybody knows I've been wasting my time
I want to forget you as fast as I can
But every time I see you the hurtin' begins again
I still love you
Everybody knows, everybody knows
