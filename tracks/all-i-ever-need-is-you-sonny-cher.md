Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Awww honey all I ever need is you

You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask
Awww honey all I ever need is you

Winters come and they go
And we watch the melting snow
But sure as summer follows spring
All the things you do give me
A reason to built my world around you

Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
But I have found my treasure
In your soul, honey
All I ever need is you

Without our love, I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you
