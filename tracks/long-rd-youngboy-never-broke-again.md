(Yung Lan on the track)
(Felipe S)
Yeah-eah, uh, uh
I, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, oh


Took it to ten and another level
Screamin', "Fuck all that love," steady runnin' it up
Let her get me caught up, I'll never let her
When they see me pull up in that double R truck, they'll never just think that I been a felon
They would think all this fame what brought all the pain, been dealin' with this since I was eleven
I'm at odds with his man 'cause I took off his brain
And I'm steady flexin' and steppin'
I just went bought a new coupe
I ain't feelin' no pressure, cash out on a Lam'
Won't be no comparin' between me and you
Since sixteen, young nigga been rich
Nigga just turned twenty, still havin' this shit
Fuck everybody hatin', I'm as real as it gets
Leave my sons with this money, I throw out the pitch (I got you forever, lil' nigga)


On a long road (Long road)
I ain't tryna find my way home (I ain't tryna find my way home)
I believe I can (Believe), I know somewhere (I know)
I'll find peace all alone (On my own)


Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh, ooh, ah


Drop off the bag and I pick it up
If you want me to do it, then it's all for your love
I'ma stay in the house, I ain't going to no club
In this bitch gettin' it in, taking pain with the drugs
Ain't no love in my heart, I woke up with a mug
Who the fuck is these hoes in this bitch? Get 'em out
Cuttin' 'em off left and right, like a body, they fold
I don't like how they rock, I'ma move 'em around
That's for niggas and hoes, too
Say, "YoungBoy, after all, can you tell me why them people chose you?"
I really don't know, fool
How the fuck did they find a young nigga who thuggin'
Who coming straight up out the bayou?
I ain't murder them niggas, please show me your witness
You get out your body, I buy you
Ones that I love treat me like a motherless infant
Can't say that I forever got you (I can't)


On a long road (Long road)
I ain't tryna find my way home
I believe I can, I know somewhere
I'll find peace all alone


Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh, ooh, ah


Hell nah, I ain't fold, I'm a rider
Never once I changed on my partners, my day ones
Finna take that pint and pour out the bottle
Thank the ones call me the G.O.A.T., but I'm the fuckin' slime one, no
