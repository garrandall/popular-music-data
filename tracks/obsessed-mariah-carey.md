I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So oh, oh, oh, oh...


All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping


Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my ladies sing)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all the girls say)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...


You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Gasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation


Why you so obsessed with me? and boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my ladies say)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my girls say)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...


(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex
(You love me, you love me, you really, really love me)
