And I was like
Why are you so obsessed with me?


I guess shorty mad cause he ain't got you no more,
So just like Pinocchio, his nose gone grow, (Gucci)
Gucci Mane, Mariah Carey bling blaww wow,
I wish I had a lie detector test right now,
He hit my girl word, oh that's what ya heard,
He know he a bird, I know he a nerd,
Catch me in the A with a bad yellow bong,
9, 10, 11, 12 diamond chains on.

All up in the blogs
Saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaines
I'm up in the A
You so so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, It must be the E
Cause you be popping,
Heard you get it popping, Oh


Why you so obsessed with me (Boy I wanna know)
Lying that you're sexing me (when everybody knows)
It's clear that you're upset with me (ooooh)
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind (crazy)
It's confusing you, you're confused you know
Why you wasting your time
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like
You're bathing in Windex
Ooh ooh ooh
Boy why you so obsessed with me?

So oh oh oh oh
So oh oh oh oh
And all the ladies sing,
So oh oh oh oh
So oh oh oh oh
All the girls sing
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh


If you sexy and you fine baby put your hands up,
And tell your ex boyfriend to get his bads up
Stop lying know your stick, home boy man up,
All my real get money ballers stand up
You see her with the kid, you know what it is,
Gucci, get the girl flawless, you what we did
Shorty stay fresh, kinda of obsessed, simply cause she blessed, you know she the best, yes

You on your job
You hating hard
Ain't gone feed you
I'm gonna let you starve
Gasping for air
I'm ventilation
You out of breath
Hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were
So why you trippin
You a mom and pop
I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference
And you a conversation
Ooooooh


Why you so obsessed with me (Boy I wanna know)
Lying that you're sexing me (when everybody knows)
It's clear that you're upset with me (oooh)
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind (crazy)
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know
Why you wasting your time
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like
You're bathing in Windex
Oooh oooh oooh
Boy why you so obsessed with me?

Ooh Ohh Ohh
So oh oh oh oh
So oh oh oh oh
And all the ladies sing,
So oh oh oh oh
So oh oh oh oh
All the girls sing
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh
Obsessed
Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh

Why you so obsessed with me
Lying that you're sexing me
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know
Why you wasting your time
