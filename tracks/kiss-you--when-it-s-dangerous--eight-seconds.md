Lifeline, I wonder how you last so long
You must be strong
When I see the flowers in your hair
And the pretty mouth with the red you adorn

When you get close
Ah danger senses please beware, it's so unfair
That I'm paying such a heavy price
By looking at the garments, that you wear so well

I won't kiss you if you want me to
It's much too easy with someone like you
In the rain or a winters night
Just wouldn't do, it's got to be so right
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous

Fine line, that's what I'm walking when I look at you
You know it's true
Of all things the thing that I want most
To catch you at the point where you don't have a clue

I won't kiss you if you want me to
It's much too easy with someone like you
In the rain or a winters night
Just wouldn't do, it's got to be so right
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you once, but never again...

I won't kiss you if you want me to
It's much too easy with someone like you
In the rain or a winters night
Just wouldn't do, it's got to be so right
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous

I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous

I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous
