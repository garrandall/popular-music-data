Sweet lover
I'm confessing that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too
I'm confessing that I need you
Honest, I do, every single moment

In your eyes, I read such strange things
But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue, making me blue

I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying can we still be friends
If you go you know you'll grieve me
All our love on you depends
Sweet lover

Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again, over again

I'm confessing that I love you
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again (over again)

I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying can we still be friends
If you go you know you'll grieve me
All our love on you depends
Sweet lover

Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again, over again

I'm confessing that I love you
Over again

Mmm, sweet, sweet lover
Mmm, sweet, sweet lover
Mmm, sweet, sweet lover...
