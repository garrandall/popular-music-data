With a cloud above her head
Here comes rainy Jane
If she stops you, man, she'll bore you
With her sad refrain

It's the same old story
We've heard a thousand times before
She'll tell you how he broke her heart
And then the tears will start to pour

Hey, Rainy Jane
You gotta stop your crying sometime
Come on, Rainy Jane
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine

Jane, you're just a shadow of
The girl you used to be
Once you used to live for life
But now you live for sympathy

It's true, your heart's been broken
And you've got the right to cry
But if you're gonna keep it up
The sunshine's gonna pass you by

Hey, Rainy Jane
You gotta stop your crying sometime
Come on, Rainy Jane
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine

You can change the weather
No one loves a rainy day
Come, let's get together
Clouds will clear up
When you cheer up
Take each raindrop
Make the rain stop

Hey, Rainy Jane
You gotta stop your crying sometime
Come on, Rainy Jane
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine

Hey, Rainy Jane
You gotta stop your crying sometime
Come on, Rainy Jane
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine

Hey, Rainy Jane
You gotta stop your crying sometime
Now come on, Rainy Jane
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine
