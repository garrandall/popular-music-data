I'm in Heaven
Listen


Pay attention, are you listening?
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear


Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove


Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby over and over
The passion starts again
You're my lollipops and everything
And a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stands still


Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove


When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove


Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Can you feel it? (Uh huh)
Baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off
This time, it's time for me and you
Are you ready? (Yes)


Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove


Close your eyes and let the music put you in the groove
Lock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you
Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
