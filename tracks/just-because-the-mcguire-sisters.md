Well-now just because you think you're so pretty,
Just because your Mama thinks you're hot (you're not!)
Just because you think you've got something,
That no - body else has got.

(You've got that certain nothin'!)

You know you made me spend all my money
You laughed, and called me old Santa Claus.
Well I'm telling you, honey, I'm through with you,
Because, just be - cause.

Oh, just because you think I'll be lonesome,
Just because you think I'll be blue,
Just because you think I'd be foolish
To stay around at home and wait for you.

Though you made me drop all my fortune,
You laughed, and called me old Santa Claus.
Well I'm telling you, honey, I'm through with you,
Because, just be - cause,
Because, just be - cause
