Yeah yeah yeah..
Hey

So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a rib when you hit the wall
Yeah, youâve had a pocket full of regrets
Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all

When the cold hard rain just wonât quit
And you canât see your way out of it


You find your faith has been lost and shaken
You take back whatâs been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, donât give in
Itâll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

Love, it wear the ring of stone
Bring you back to being born again
oh, itâs a helping hand when you need it most
A lighthouse shining on the coast
That never goes dim

When your heart is full of doubt
And you think that thereâs no way out


You find your faith has been lost and shaken
You take back whatâs been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, donât give in
Itâll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

Like a river keeps on rolling
Like the north wind blowing
Donât it feel good knowing
Yeah


You find your faith has been lost and shaken
You take back whatâs been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, donât give in
Itâll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

Love is unstoppable
So you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Love, love is unstoppable
