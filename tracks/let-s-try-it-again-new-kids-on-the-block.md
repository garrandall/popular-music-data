I've heard of true loves that lasted forever
I guess there is a way
And I've heard of true loves that needed each other
More and more each day

What is love when there is no one that cares
Next time you need my love I'll be there, be right by your side

Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again my love for you it has no end
Let's try it again till the end
All because I love you

I've heard of true loves that stayed with each other
Didn't wander through the night
And I've heard of true loves that prayed for each other
Didn't argue, fuss or fight

Now I know just what love's all about
Next time you need my love I won't doubt, doubt your love again

Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again my love for you it has no end
Let's try it again till the end
All because I love you

You got to try it again
My love for you it has no end
You know and I know
It's all because I love you

Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again my love for you it has no end
Let's try it again till the end
All because I love you
