They call me Mr. Pitiful
Baby thats my name now, oh
They call me Mr. Pitiful
That's how I got my fame

But people just don't want to understand that
What make a man feel so blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful
'Cause I've lost someone just like you, yeah

The call me Mr. Pitiful
This everybody know now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
'Most everyplace I go

But nobody seems to understand now
How can a man sing such a sad song
When he lost everything
When he lost everything that he had

How can I explain to you?
How somebody can get so very blue, now
How can I tell you about my past?
If all things won't end

Mr. Pitiful
That's my name now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
That's how I got my fame

But nobody seems to understand
Oh what make a man can feel so blue and
They call me Mr. Pitiful
'Cause I'm in love with you

Can I explain to you?
Everything is going wrong
I've lost everything I had
I have to sing this sad song
To get back to her
And I want you and I want you and I want you
And I want you and I wanna tell you that now
That everything is going through my mind
And I wanna sing
And I don't wanna sing this song with you
I gonna sing this song for everybody
'Cause I want them to understand what I talkin' about
I want you to understand what I'm sayin'
