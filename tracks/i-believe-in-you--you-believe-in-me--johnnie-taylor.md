One thing I can say about the people of the world today
They see you with a good thing
They want to take it away

I believe in you, you believe in me too

Even your best friend will come around 
Making sly remarks
Trying to put you down

I believe in you, you believe in me too

People talking, trying to pull us apart
Sticking pins and needles in both of our hearts
I love you no matter
Don't care about the stormy weather

I believe in you, you believe in me too

I heard your mother say
Loving me didn't make no sense
But when she put me down
You stood up in my defense

I believe in you, you believe in me too

We had our hard times
And almost didn't make it
We always worked it
Never tried to fake it

That's why I believe in you, you believe in me too

When I look around and I see other people in so much trouble
All of them comes down truth trust
Cause what we gotta do
Gotta believe in each other baby...

I believe in you, you believe in me too...
