Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?


Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she nice?


Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?


Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?


Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street?
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?


Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she nice?


Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?


Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?


Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
