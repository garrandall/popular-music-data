Footprints in the snow
The world a shining globe
The scent of evergreen is like home
A deep breath cold and clean

Sound of distant bells
The story they foretell
An almost silent night
A sacred stillness brought to life

Like music, like magic
Somehow it just happens
I could stay here forever
Nothing can compare
To this moment with you
And winter in the air
Winter in the air

Sparkling on the streets
Red birds hear them sing
All is calm and bright
Underneath the stars that watch the night

Like music, like magic
Somehow it just happens
I could stay here forever
Nothing can compare
To this moment with you
And winter in the air
Winter in the air

On this snowy night
The world is pure and right

Like music, like magic
Somehow it just happens
I could stay here forever
Nothing can compare
To this moment with you
And winter in the air
Winter in the air
