Yeah. (Young Money)
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Look look.
I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck goin' platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
They know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it


Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just wanna smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."


I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I gotta kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I gotta get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it


Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."


Famous ain't it?
You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flat line, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it
