Oh, hoo, give it away
Oh, hoo, give it away

What's the sense in giving you love
When you're gonna give it away
Oh, yeah (give it away)

And what's sense
In giving you kisses
When you're gonna give 'em away
Oh, yeah (give it away)

You say you have
Nothing to live for
Baby, baby, I'm here
Knocking at your door

(Give it away) it's all right
(Give it away)
You can do what you wanna

(Give it away, it's all right)
'Cause I know you're gonna
(Give it away, give it away)

What's the sense
In having my love
When I'm gonna give it to you
(Give it away)

Give it straight to you, baby
(Give it away)
And I don't mean maybe

What's sense denying I love you
When you're mad and
I'm proud of you now
(Give it away) oh, yeah
(Give it away)

Baby, love was made for two
I know, I know, I know
It's meant for me and you

(Give it away) it's all right
(Give it away)
You can do what you wanna

(Give it away, it's all right)
'Cause I know you're gonna
(Give it away, give it away)

I love you
No matter what you do
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ah...
It's all right
It's all right

Baby, love was made for two
I know, I know, I know
It's meant for me and you

Oh, what's the sense in having my love
When I'm gonna give it to you
And what's sense in giving you kisses
When it's you I'm gonna be missing

And what's sense in giving you honey
When you're taking away my money
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, yeah, yeah

What's the sense in giving you love
What's the sense in giving you money
