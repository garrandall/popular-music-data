Well, I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said, "I know what's on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass ain't always greener on the other side"

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody any body's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt, then what?
Oh then what?

Well, I ain't saying that looking's a crime
Well, I've done my share from time to time
It don't mean that you gotta take that leap
When you're standin' on the brink
Before you jump you gotta step back and think
There's price for every promise you don't keep

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody, any body's gonna trust?
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt, then what?
Oh, then what?

Do what you want, do what you wish
It's your life but remember this
There's bound to be some consequences
Sneaking under other fences

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody any body's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt, then what?
Oh, then what?
