Miscellaneous
Are You Really Mine
(Really really really mine you're really mine
Really really really mine you're really mine)

You tell me that you love me
And you tell me that you want me
And you even wear my graduation ring

(Doo-wah) It's too wonderful
(Doo-wah) It's too beautiful
(Doo-wah) It's a fantastic thing

Are you really really mine (really mine)
Really mine (really mine)
Really mine
Will my lucky little star (little star)
Really shine (really shine)
Really shine
Kiss me with feeling
Make my heart go reeling
Make me know that you are really really really mine

(Really really really mine you're really mine
Really really really mine you're really mine)

You call me every morning
And you see me every evening
And you swear that I'm the only one for you

(Doo-wah) Here's the funny part
(Doo-wah) Though you cross your heart
(Doo-wah) I can't believe it's true

Are you really really mine (really mine)
Really mine (really mine)
Really mine
Will my lucky little star (little star)
Really shine (really shine)
Really shine
Kiss me with feeling
Make my heart go reeling
Make me know that you are really really really mine

(Really really really mine you're really mine)
Really mine
(Really really really mine you're really mine)
Really mine
(Really really really mine you're really mine)
