I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
And the touch of a world that is older
I turn the switch and check the number
I leave it on when in bed I slumber
I hear the rhythms of the music
I buy the product and never use it
I hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand, just what does he say?


I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio

I dial it in and tune the station
They talk about the U.S. inflation
I understand just a little
No comprende, it's a riddle


I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio
I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio

I wish I was in Tijuana
Eating barbecued iguana
I'd take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home

I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
I dial it in from south of the border
I hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand, just what does he say?


I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio
I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio

Radio, radio
Radio, radio
Radio, radio
Radio, radio


I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio
I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican (whoa-oh) radio

Radio, radio
What does he say?
Radio, radio
Radio, radio
Radio, radio
