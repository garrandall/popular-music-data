I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
And the touch of a world that is older
I hit the switch and check the number
I leave it on and then I slumber
I hear the rhythm ringing through it
Flamenco guitar y Cumbia music
I hear the talking of the DJ
Let's have a listen
What does he say?

I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican radio

I dial it in and tune the station 
They talk about the Iraq invasion
I understand just a little
No comprende it's a riddle

I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican radio

I wish I was in Tijuana
Sipping back an ice cold cahuama
I take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home
I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
I dial in from south of the border
I hear the talking of the DJ
Let's try to figure out
What does he say?

I'm on a Mexican radio
I'm on a Mexican radio
