Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do but say uh huh
Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what


Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner


Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side


Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do?
What would Dierks do?
Grab a guitar and go sing her a song
And go play one of my songs?
No, don't play one of yours, play one of mine, man!


Yeah, sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner
