See I stepped out, on the faith that escape
Was the best route
But it's safe now to say that I'm stressed out
'Cause I maybe might want you back, yeah
And I'm a mess now, making love is a dub
It's just sex now
When I'm done, they don't lay up, they just get out
That's why I'm calling her
Unblocked your number just to tell you I love you


And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I...

I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now

You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was


I miss you too much (let's get this thing back)
Used to cruising with my boo (those were the good days)
The best  waking good
And I didn't have patience to mean it
And second, I loved you alright
'Cause I should've have waited a minute


I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now

So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is
Yeah, I saved all the texts off of my ex
Minus the tears
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was
'Cause I...

I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
I can't help it, I just...
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
I can't help it, I just...
