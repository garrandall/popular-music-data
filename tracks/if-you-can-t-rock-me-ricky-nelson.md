Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
I'll get me another woman you can find another man

Everytime we hear a rock and roll band
Everytime we hear a rock and roll band
All you wanna do baby is hold my hand

Well one thing honey before we go
Well one thing honey that I want you to know
Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can

Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
I'll get me another woman you can find another man

Everytime we hear a rock and roll band
Everytime we hear a rock and roll band
All you wanna do baby is hold my hand

Well one thing honey before we go
Well one thing honey that I want you to know
Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
Well if you can't rock me I'll find me somebody who can
