Make the world go away
Get it up on my shoulders
Say the thinqs you used to say
And make the world go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world would be astray
If you do let forgive me
And make the world go away
Make the world go away
.
I'm sorry by hurt you
I make it up day by day
You say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away
Make the world go away
. .
