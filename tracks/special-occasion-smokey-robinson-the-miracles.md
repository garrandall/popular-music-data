Hm, hm, yeah
Special occasion
Like when you dress up
In your tie and tails
Yeah, yeah
Special occasion
Every time and it never fails

To give me a thrill
That's fresh and new
Every time I'm kissin' you
It's something that you do
That makes every time you kiss me

A real special occasion
Like one that calls for
A toast of champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Special occasion
Every time and
It's hard to explain

How the same old touch
From the same old hand
Can make me feel
Like a different man

I just can't understand
But every time you touch me
It's a real special occasion
Yeah, yeah
Special occasion, oh, oh yeah
Hm hm, yeah

Oh, beautiful music begins to play
You are the sun
That brightens up my day
Why don't you stay
'Cause every time I'm with you

It's a real special occasion
Like when in school
You get your cap and gown
Yeah, now

It's a real special occasion
Every time you come around
Baby, it's a real special occasion
