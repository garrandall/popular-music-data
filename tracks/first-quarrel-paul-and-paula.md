Both We had our first quarrel today
Paula I threw your picture away
Paul Im sorry I made you cry
Paula Forgive me, so am I
Both We had our first quarrel today

Paul I thought I saw you with Jim
Paula I was just talking with him
Paul Well, I guess I had it wrong
Paula I should have been at home
Both We had our first quarrel today

What may seem wrong at the time isnt always true
Our love will go on as long as theres me and you

Paul What was it all about?
Paula I don't remember now
Both We had our first quarrel today

What may seem wrong at the time isnt always true
Our love will go on as long as theres me and you

Paul What was it all about?
Paula I don't remember now
Both We had our first quarrel today
