When I turn back all the pages
Of my life through all the stages
It`s been you through all the changes
I been through...it was always you
There to make me be strong
And helping me to hold on through it all
It was your love that got me through the night
No one`s ever known me better baby, through your eyes
I can see the mirror of my soul...
CHORUS
You`re the story of my life
You`re the one that got me
Through the night
You`ve been right here by my side
When I needed you, when I needed you
You were there to make it right
If I wrote a book you`d be in every line
For all time, you`re the story
You`re the story of my life...
When I think about tomorrow
There`ll be joy and there`ll be sorrow
But I know that I will follow you
`Cause I`m lost without your love
I`ll be there, there when you need me
There like the very air you`re breathin`
You`re my blood, oh my love
CHORUS
Through the night
No one`s ever known me better baby, through your eyes
I can see the mirror of my soul...
CHORUS TWICE
You`re the story of my life...
You`re the story of my life...
