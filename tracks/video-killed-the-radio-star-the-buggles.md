I heard you on the wireless back in '52
Lying awake intently tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
Oh-a-oh

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see

Oh-a-oh
I met your children
Oh-a-oh oh oh oh
What did you tell them?

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-a-a oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go:

Oh-a-oh
You were the first one
Oh-a-oh oh oh oh
You were the last one

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
And pictures came and broke your heart
Put down the blame on VCR...

You are the radio star
You are the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
(You are the radio star)
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
(You are the radio star)
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
(You are the radio, you are the radio star)
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
(The radio star)
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
(The radio star)

Oh-a-oh, oh-a-oh...
