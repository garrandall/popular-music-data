I heard you on the wireless back in '52
Lying awake, intently tuning in on you
If I was young, it didn't stop you coming through
Oh-a oh-a
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the problems you could see


Oh-a oh-a
I met your children
Oh-a oh-a
What did you tell 'em?


Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-a-a-oh


And now we meet in an abandoned studio (Oh-a)
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago (Oh-oh-oh-oh-a)
And you remember the jingles used to go


Oh-a oh-a
You were the first one
Oh-a oh-a
You were the last one


Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Oh-a-a-a-oh
Oh-a-a-a-oh


Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put the blame on VCR


You are a radio star
You are a radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star (A, a radio star)
(A radio star) Video killed the radio star
(You are) Video killed the radio star
