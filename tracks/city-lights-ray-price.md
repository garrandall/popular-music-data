The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
A cabaret a honky tonk their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights

Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights
