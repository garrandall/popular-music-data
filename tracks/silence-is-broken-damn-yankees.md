Never again
You say the words and let
The sunshine in again
You can close your eyes
And know it's safe inside
To sing you lullaby

Now I lay me down

You broke the chains
And you won't be silent anymore
Oh no! Now you're gonna shout about it
No! No more! Yeah yeah this is the end

The silence is broken now
It's over now
The words have been spoken
And with every word you say
You blow away
The tears of another time

Face to face
Anyone can see you're not
The child you were before

Now I lay you down

You take your place
No one can take away your heart
Oh no! There can be no doubt about it
No! No more! Yeah yeah this is the end

The silence is broken now
It's over now
The truth has been spoken
And with every word you say
You blow away
Yeah

Never again
You say the words and let
The sunshine in again
You can change the world
No one can take away your heart

The silence is broken now
It's over now
The words have been spoken
And with every word you say
You blow away
The tears of another time

The silence is broken now
It's over now
The truth has been spoken
And with every word you say
You blow away
The scene of another crime
