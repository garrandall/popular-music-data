I still love you
Just like I did before
But before you smile
And walk through that door
Now listen
I don't wanna cry, no
I don't wanna cry no more
No, darling, no more
You come and go
Just like the morning sun
I was so serious
You were having fun
Now hear me
I don't wanna cry, no
I don't wanna cry no more
No, little girl, no more
Welcome to my lips
Welcome to my charms
Welcome to my, my
My sweet heart, yes, yes

I have to offer you
So why don't you come on
And just take it, take it
Take anymore
Nevermore
I'm begging you please
If you'll just, you'll just
Come on home to me
I want you near me
I don't wanna cry, no
I don't wanna cry no more
No, darling, no more
Walk on in, oh
Walk on in
Baby, baby, baby
Walk right in in
Oh, open up the door
Please, just open up the door...
