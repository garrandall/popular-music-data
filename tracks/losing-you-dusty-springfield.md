How many tears do you cry
If love should break your heart in two?
How many tears will I cry
Now that I know I'm losing you?

I can't stop wanting you
And no matter what you do
You're still a part of me
Even though I'm losing you, oh

How many years will go by
Before my heart begins to mend?
Waiting and wondering why
I never thought our love could end

I try forgetting you
But you're still here on my mind
It would take a miracle
But someday maybe I'll find

That I'm in the loving arms of someone
That I'll know, know he's the someone
Who'll kiss all the heartache away
And come that day
I won't mind losing you

Yes, I try forgettin' you
But you're still here on my mind
It would take, yeah, a miracle
But someday maybe I'll find

That I'm in the loving arms of someone
That I'll know, know he's the someone
Who'll kiss all the heartache away
And when he comes to me that day
I won't mind losing you, oh, oh
I won't mind losing you, yeah
I won't mind losing you
