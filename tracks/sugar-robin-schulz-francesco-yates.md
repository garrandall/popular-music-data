Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh, baby!
Oh
Oh
Hey...

She's got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen. She don't compromise

She's something mystical in colored lights
So far from typical but take my advice
Before you play with fire do think twice
And if you get burned don't be surprised

Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
And oh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
You've got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sweet talkin' lady, love how you entice
Sugar, with just the right amount of spice
Charming, alluring everyone's desire
She's out to get you you can't run you can't hide

She's something mystical in colored lights
So far from typical but take my advice
Before you play with fire do think twice
And if you get burned, well, baby, don't you be surprised

Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
And oh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
You've got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

But you won't get me tonight

Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
And oh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
You've got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, how you get so fly?
