Love comes, beats on drums
And the people sing
Anything, any song will do

Love dies, lover cries
And crawls away
Nothing to say to you


All it is is all
All it is is all
I think I hear the drum
Boom ba boom ba boom
Boom ba boom ba boom
Your turn to dance will come

Love comes, beats on drums
And your hopes arise
Open your eyes and see

Hearts beat
Love was sweet
And played our song
Now you belong to me



Oh, love comes, beats on drums
And the people will sing
I think I hear the drum

Oh, love comes, beats on drums
And the people will sing
Your turn to dance will come

Love comes, beats on drums
And the people will sing...
