Now for those of you
Who never been down to Tony Joe White country
Never been 
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this so that you'll
Understand what it is I'm talkin' about ... yeah

Down there they got a plant
That grows out in the woods,
And in the field
Grows up the long side on the rocks
In the trees
And everybody calls it polk salad
That's polk salad
And I used to know a girl lived down there
She'd go out in the evenings
And pick herself a little bit of it
And she carried it home
And cook it for supper
Cause that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

I said down in Lou'siana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl who swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Salad Annie, Polk Salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Because her mama was a workin on the chain gang
She was a mean, vicious woman

Every day 'fore suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick herself a mess o' pokl salad
And carry it home in a tote sack
Polk Salad Annie, gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Because her mama was a workin on the chain gang
A wretched, spiteful, straight razor totin' woman!

Now give me some polk salad, give me some

Her daddy was lazy and no count
He claimed he had a bad back
And all the brothers were fit for
Was stealin watermelons out of my truck patch
Polk Salad Annie, gators got your granny
Everybody told it was a shame
Cause her mama was a workin on the chain gang
Sock a little polk salad
I need me a mess of it, sock a little...
