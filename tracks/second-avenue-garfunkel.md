Since we can no longer make it, girl
I found a new place to live my life
It's really no place at all

Just a hole in the wall, you see
It's cold and dusty but I let it be
Livin' here without you
On Second Avenue

And since our stars took different paths
I guess I won't be shavin' in your looking glass
Guess my old friendly grin
Must have started to dim, somehow

And I certainly don't need it now
Still, I keep smiling through
On Second Avenue
I can still see you standing

There on the third-floor landing
The day you visited we hardly said a word
Outside it was rainin'
You said you couldn't be stayin

And you went back to your flowers and your birds
Since we can no longer see the light
The way we did when we kissed that night
Then all the things that we felt

Must eventually melt and fade
Like the frost on my window pane
Where I wrote, "I. M. U." (I Miss You)
On Second Avenue
