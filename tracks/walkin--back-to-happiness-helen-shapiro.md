Funny but it's true
What lonliness can do
Since I've been away
I have loved you more each day

Walking back to happiness
Said goodbye to loneliness
I never knew I'd miss you
Now I know what I must do
Walking back to happiness I shared with you

I'm making up everything you said
And mistakes to which they lead
I shouldn't have gone away
So I'm coming back today

Walking back to happiness I threw away
Walking back to happiness with you
Said farewell to loneliness I knew

Played aside foolish pride
Learnt the truth from tears I cried
Spread the news I'm on my way
All my blues have blown away

I'm bringing you love so true
Cause that's what I owe to you

Walking back to happiness I shared with you
Walking back to happiness with you
Said farewell to loneliness I knew

Played aside foolish pride
Learnt the truth from tears I cried
Spread the news I'm on my way
Mama blues have blown away

I'm bringing you love so true
Cause that's what I owe to you

Walking back to happiness I shared with you
Walking back to happiness again
Walking back to happiness again
Walking back to happiness agan
