Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is a warmth that I thought I could never find

(Sitting here all alone) Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone) Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because) I know I could cry

I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?

(Isn't it time? it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time?
(Isn't it time? you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night

(Sitting here all alone) Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone) Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because) I don't want to cry

I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?

(Isn't it time? it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time?
(Isn't it time? you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I feel a warmth in my heart and my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength that I need just to get me through

(Sitting here all alone) Just wondering why
(Then I stop myself because) I know I could cry
(Then I think of you) And everything seems alright

I've finally found the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait) (Don't have to wait)
I know it's time
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Oh yeah (Isn't it time?) I know it's time

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
It must be time (Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?) It must be time

(Isn't time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait) It oughta be time
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
It must be time
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)

(Isn't it time? you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
(Isn't it time?)
