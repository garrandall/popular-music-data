I want her, I need her
And someday, some way... I'll meet her
She'll be kinda shy
And real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain she's my girl
By the things she'll like to do

Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love

When she's near me, I'll kiss her
And when she leaves me... I'll miss her
Though sometimes we'll fight
I won't really care
I know she's gonna be all right
'Cause we got so much to share

Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love

(Joannie) No, no she'll never do
(Peggy) No it isn't her too
They would never, no they'd never
Never, ever love

Walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars
Or bein' so in love
Walkin' in the rain
