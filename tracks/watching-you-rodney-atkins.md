Driving through town, just my boy and me
With a Happy Meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy 'til his nuggets were gone

A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a-flying and his orange drink covered his lap

Well, then my four-year-old said a four letter word
That started with "S" and I was concerned
So I said, "Son, now where'd you learn to talk like that?"

He said, "I've been watching you, dad. Ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah, we're just alike. Hey, ain't we, dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you"

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said, "Lord, please help me help my stupid self"

Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees

He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said, "Son, now where'd you learn to pray like that?"

He said, "I've been watching you, dad. Ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike. Hey, ain't we, dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you"

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said, "My little bear is growing up"
He said, "But when I'm big I'll still know what to do"

'Cause I've been watching you, dad. Ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be as strong as Superman
We'll be just alike. Hey, won't we, dad?
When I can do everything you do
'Cause I've been watching you"
