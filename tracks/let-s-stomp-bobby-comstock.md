In the hall
They got a rocking band
Come on, baby
Let me take your hand

Let's stomp
Oh, girl, let's stomp now
Your sure look fine
Gonna make you mine
Let's stomp

Hey, baby, put your stompers on
We'll do a dance that's really gone

Let's stomp, yeah, let's stomp
You know you're looking good
Like I knew you would
Let's stomp

Hey, baby, it's me and you
We're gonna stomp
The whole night through

Let's stomp
Oh, girl, let's stomp
You know I love you so
I'll never let you go
Let's stomp

Hey, baby, put your stompers on
We'll do a dance that's really gone

Let's stomp
Hey, girl, let's stomp now
You know you're looking good
Like I knew you would
Let's stomp

Hey, baby, just me and you
We'll do the stomp
The whole night through

Let's stomp
Little girl, do the stomp
You know I love you so
I'll never let you go
Let's stomp
