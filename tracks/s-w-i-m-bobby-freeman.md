Come on, all you swimmers
I'll show you the way
The number one dance in the USA

The name of the dance you did before
Now I'm back to swim some more
Let's swim again

You can do the swim
With moves that zing
San Francisco did it
Made the whole town swing
Let's swim again

You can swim up close
Just too much
Look, dance
But please don't touch
Let's swim again

Come on, all you people
Dig the new groove
Shake it up, baby
Really move

I did the shimmy shimmy
Then I did the twist
Now I do the swim
And you spell it like this
S-W-I-M

Come on, baby, take a chance
Losers drown and winners dance

We're doing the S-W-I-M, whoa

Come on, baby
We're gonna swim again
We're gonna do the backstroke
We're gonna do the crawl
We're gonna do the dog paddle
We're gonna do 'em all

My, my, my, my, my, my, my
We're gonna do the freestyle
It's outta sight...
