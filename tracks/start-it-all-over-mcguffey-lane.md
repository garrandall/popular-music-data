I'm going away
Leaving today
I've got to start it all over
There's nothin' you can say
To make me change my mind

All the places we've been to
Reminds me still of you
And I lose every time I try to fight it

I'm going away
Leaving today
I've got to start it all over
There's nothin' you can say
To make me change my mind

There ain't nothin' in this whole town
To keep this ol' boy around
So I think I'll just head on down the highway
Anybody going my way

Every time I think of you
My feelings slip into
A place where me and you
Could never find them

I'm going away
Leaving today
I've got to start it all over
There's nothin' you can say
To make me change my mind

All the places we've been to
Reminds me still of you
And I lose every time I try to fight it
I won't deny it

I'm going away, leaving today
I've got to start it all over

I'm going away, leaving today
I've got to start it all over

I'm going away, leaving today
I've got to start it all over
