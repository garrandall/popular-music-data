Valentino
Bobby Valentino


When I get up all in you
We can hear the angels calling us (chea)
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang,
I'll make that body sang
(She know what I mean) I make it say

Wee oh wee oh wee (wee)
Wee oh wee oh wee (wee)
Wee oh wee oh wee
Like a cop car
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
I'll make you say


Doing a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
She got me thinking I can date a cop
'Cause her uniform fit her so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in the car, she cut off her lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkin' 'bout

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee

And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high above the law
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talkin' about

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee


When I get up all in you
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang,
I'll make that body sang
I make it say

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Like a cop car
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
I'll make you say


And after we got done
I said, "Lady, what's your number?" She said, "911."
emergency only
Head doctor perform surgery on me
and now I'm healed
I make her wear nothing but handcuffs and heels
And I beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby yeah I beat it like a cop
beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby said beat it like a cop
But I ain't tryna be violent
But I'll do the time but her love is timeless
Mrs. Officer
I know you wish your name was Mrs. Carter huh?

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Like a cop car


When I get up all in you
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang
I'll make that body sang
I make it say

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
I'll make you say


Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of you
I'm Kidd Kidd, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold you
hands so big you thought I told you to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the rover
Then she pulled me closer, threw me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off
(all you heard over the dispatcher is...)

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee


When I get up all in you
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang
I'll make that body sang
I make it say


Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
'Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I can't wait to get it on
I wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer


When I get up all in you
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang
I'll make that body sang
I make it say

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee

Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
Wee oh wee oh wee
I'll make you say
