The sky is burnin' I believe my soul's on fire,
You are, I'm learning, the key to my desire.

Waiting for the van to arrive,
The prisoners were lined
up outside.
Jumped a wall, hitcheda ride, and
now I'm here
to say;
Love you, baby, anyway, oh, yeah.
The sky is burnin' I believe my soul is on fire,
You are, I'm learning, the key to my desire.

Ran across the country fields,
In all terrain, they had guns and dogs and everything.
Swam a river try'n to lose my trail,
But they caught me, under the bridge. Oh yeah!

The sky is burnin' I believe my soul's on fire,
You are, I'm learning, the key to my desire.

Oh, yeah.

The sky is burnin' I believe my soul's on fire,
You are, I am learning, the key to my desire.

The judge said, 'this man's a danger to humanity,
We're gonna lock him up and throw away the key'
Now, baby, your love has sent me to jail
But I'd rather die than see you with another man

It's burnin' baby, mm, mm; I believe my souls on fire

I believe my souls on fire,
Working on the railroad, every day
But they can't keep me here
And I'm not gonna stay
I got to get outta this place
I'll see you, baby.

It's burnin', yeah, it's burnin'.
I believe my souls on fire,
Keep on burnin',
Ah, yeah, yeah, ah, oh, oho. Keep on burnin'
