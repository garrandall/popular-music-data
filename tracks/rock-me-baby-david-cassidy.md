You may call me a rollin' stone, I'm a free born man and I stand alone
I come a-lookin' for a little satisfaction
I don't drive no Cadillac, all I've got's hangin' on my back
But I do believe in a physical attraction
I can warm your coldest night, I'll make ev'rythin' all right

Hoo, rock me baby, let me feel that beat
I said ahooo, rock me baby, right down to my feet
I said ahooo, rock me baby, hold me oh so tight
I said ahooo, rock me baby, rock me through the night
You better hold me while you can
Or you gonna lose your midnight man
Now come on and rock me, rock me

I was twelve when I left home, ever since I've been on my own
I come a-lookin' for a little recreation
Guess I'll never settle down, it's always been just a one more town
Why I've loved from coast to coast across the nation
I can't promise I'll be true but I'll just see what I can do

Come on hoo, rock me baby, let me feel that beat
I said ahooo, rock me baby, right down to my feet
I said ahooo, rock me baby, hold me oh so tight
I said ahooo, rock me baby, rock me through the night
You better hold me while you can
Or you gonna lose your midnight man
Now come on and rock me, rock me

Mh, come on and rock me, come on and shock me
All right now, roll me
Come on and squeeze me, ooh, you sure can please me, uh-uh
All right now, get down

Hoo, rock me baby, let me feel that beat ...
