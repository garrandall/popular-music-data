In the Southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pony
Rides a cowboy all alone

And he sees the cattle grazing
Where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing
And the cannons used to roar

You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear 'em as they answer
To that roll call in the sky

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett
And a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickenson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for

Back in eighteen thirty-six
Gouston said to Travis
Get some volunteers and
Go fortify the Alamo

You may never see your loved ones
Travis told them that day
Those that want to can leave now
Those that fight to the death, let 'em stay

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle loaders
Stood together heel and toe
To defend the Alamo

With his banners a-dancing
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing on a horse
That was black as the night

A hundred eighty-nine brave men
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again

Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came

Twice he charged them to recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed them one and all

Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers
Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord

In the Southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pony
Rides a cowboy all alone

And he sees the cattle grazing
Where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing
And the cannons used to roar

And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly
To the men of Alamo

To the men of Alamo
To the men of Alamo
