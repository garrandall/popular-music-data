You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me


Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me


When you're on the outside baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine


You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me


Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
