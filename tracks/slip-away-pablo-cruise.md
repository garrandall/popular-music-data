I'm lookin' back, over my shoulder
Thinking of days gone by
One more fool takin' someone for granted
How could I be so blind?

And I didn't believe that you'd really leave me
When it felt so right

I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away

They say there's a reason
For all the pain in our lives
I guess I believe it's true
But where was I to leave me, now that I know
The reason that I lost you

I could've given you more
Could've loved you better
But I missed my cue

And I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away, let you get away

I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away

(I let you slip away from my love, baby)
You walked right out of my life, baby
(I let you get away)
And left me staring at a lonely, lonely, lonely night

(I let you slip away from my love, baby)
I lost the best thing I ever had
(I let you get away)
That day you walked away
(I let you slip away from my love, baby)

I let you, I let you, I let you slip away from my love
(I let you get away)
(I let you slip away, slip away from my love, baby)
Slipped away from me, girl
(I let you get away)

Oh, wanna moon rise with you so
(I let you slip away, slip away from my love, baby)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
(I let you get away)

You got away from my love, girl
(I let you slip away, slip away from my love, baby)
(I let you get away)
Let you get away, yeah
(I let you slip away, slip away from my love, baby)
I let you get away, yeah
