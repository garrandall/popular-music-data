Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just

Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?


Turned 7 to a 14
14 to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game
Switched up on you hoes, mayne
Big body take both lanes
Backseat blowin' propane
All black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own mayne
My new shit sound like it's "Soul Train"
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain, RSC, we fo' sho bang
Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just

Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?


I leave it behind if you let me
I probably got drowned just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down
( Got my All Money In chain too)
Let me down


It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk I'ma shine
Might a been way before its time
Posted wit my back against the wall
Life is a bitch but she mine
The rag six deuce yeah it's mine
"The Westside II", yeah it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall like the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendleton's
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut


Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just

Five, four, three two
That's time, I got, to you
That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?

I leave it behind if you let me
I probably got drowned just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down
Let me down
