Any time you like to get next to me, any time
I could easily make you mine, any time
If you ever end needing a loving care, I'll be there
This is something we can share, any time

Just a smile, just an only smile
Lets me know where I belong
Don't you know you're turning me on, turn me on
Finding out what it's all about
Reaching up to the sky
Don't you know you're getting me high, oh too high

Everybody likes to have someone else, to get mine
There's nobody else but you, you and I
Any time you like to get next to me, any time
Nobody can deny, we'll get by

Just a smile just an only smile
Lets me know where I belong
Don't you know you're turning me on, turn me on
Finding out what it's all about
Reaching up to the sky
Don't you know you're getting me high, oh too high

Just a smile just an only smile
Lets me know where I belong
Don't you know you're turning me on, turn me on
Finding out what it's all about
Reaching up to the sky
Don't you know you're getting me high, oh too high

Any time you like to get next to
Any time you like to get next to
Any time you like to get next to me
