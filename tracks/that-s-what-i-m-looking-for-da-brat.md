Lil' Mo Talks...


I Don't Wanna Feel Like I'm Robbin' Da Craddle
(Craddle, Craddle, Craddle)
And I Don't Wanna Feel Like I'm Takin' Momma's Baby
(Baby, Baby, Baby)
Cause I Know What It Look Like
And What It Really Is
I Know What Don't Look Right
But He's Gotta Kid (Ohh)
Cause It's Whatever (It's Whatever)
U Wanna Call It (Ayy)
Cause That's Mah Homey (That's My Little Homey)
He's Mah Shawty
And


That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
He's Only 21 (He's Only 21)
And He's Got Experience (He's Got Experience)
And He Help Me Get My Groove Back (My Groove Back)
Believe That (Believe That)


I Know Age Is Just A Number
But I'm Feelin' Like Stella
Got Him 'Bout Seven Years (O Yes I'm Feelin Like I'm Stella)
Finally Found A Shawty That's Down For Whatever
(He's Down For Whatever)
Oh When It's Time To Roll
Whenever I Wanna Get Low
I Swear He Handle His Business Like He's Grown
And...He's Not Insecure
Yes He's So Mature
What More Could A Woman Ask For
Cause It's Whatever (Cause It's Whatever)
U Wanna Call It (Whatever U Wanna Call It 2x)
Cause That's Mah Homey (That's My Little Homey)
He's Mah Shawty
And


That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
He's Only 21 (He's Only 21)
And He's Got Experience (He's Got Experience)
And He Help Me Get My Groove Back (My Groove Back)
Believe That (Believe That)


The Young Only 21 Like He Omarion
He Got Gold Wit 'Em
Like He Runnin A Marathon
Nuthin Slow Wit 'Im
And When They Come Wit The Paper Wrong
He Go Get 'Em
Handle The B.I. 'Til Da Sun Come Up
Cause He A Cold Nigga
And It Happen To Be Why I Had To Sic Him
I Threw The Pussy Cat Doll On 'Em
Cause I Would Stick Wit 'Em
That's Mah Baby And I'm His Sitter
And When The Base Is Low Then He My Home Run Hitter
When I Face Foward Did He Know How To Fix It
Business, Pleasure, He Don't Mix It
It's Whatever, We Jus Kick It
And I Don't Give A Damn What Nobody Say
These Butterflies Ain't Goin Away
I Love His Lil' Babyface
And I Only Think Of Him On Two Occassions
That's Night And Day (Yay)


That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
That's My Youngin' (My Youngin')
He's Only 21 (21)
And He's Got Experience (He's Got Experience)
And He Help Me Get My Groove Back (My Groove Back)
Believe That (Believe That)

He's Only 21
He's Got Experience
He's Only 21
That's My Youngin'

He's Only 21
He's Got Experience
He Help Me Get Mah Groove Back...
