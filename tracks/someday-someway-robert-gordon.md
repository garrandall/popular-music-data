I can't stand to see you sad
I can't bear to hear you cry
If you can't tell me what you need
All I can do is wonder why

Someday, someway, aww
Someday, someway, yeah now
Someday, someway, maybe I'll understand you

After all you've done for me
All I really want to do
Is take the love you've brought my way
And give it all right back to you

Someday, someway, aww
Someday, someway, yeah yeah
Someday, someway, maybe I'll understand you

You've taken everything from me
I've taken everything from you
I'll love you for my whole life through

Now after all you've done for me
All I really want to do
