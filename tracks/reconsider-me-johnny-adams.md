Hello baby, yes it's really me
After the wrong I've done
Guess you're surprised to see me here at your door
Like a sparrow with a broken wing
Who's come back to beg you reconsider me
Oh, reconsider me
I can't make it without your love, you see
Just let me and I'll love you eternally
Oh baby, reconsider me

I learned the truth about the so-called good life
It was just a candle too short to burn the night
Now the darkness in my heart
I bring to you in plea
Oh light my way again reconsider me
Oh reconsider me
I can[t make it without your love, you see
So just let me and I'll love you eternally
Oh baby reconsider me
