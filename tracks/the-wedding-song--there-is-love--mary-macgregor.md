We are gathered in this sacred space of tenderness and care
To witness this most blessed rite, your happiness we share.
The union of your spirits here is wondrous to behold
This is the greatest magic that the Universe does hold.
It is love, it is love.

Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning, is now until the end
Woman is the chalice, and the athame the man.
And there's love, there is love.

Well is there a better reason for becoming man and wife?
It is love that brings you here, and it's love that brings you life.
For as constant and as steady as the stars that shine above
And as solid a foundation as the stones shall be your love.
There is love, there is love.

(Repeat 1st verse)
