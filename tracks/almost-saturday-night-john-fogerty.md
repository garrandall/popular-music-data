Oh-ho-ho

Outside my window
I can hear a radio
And I know that motor wagon's gettin' ready to fly
And it's almost Saturday night

Bye-bye, tomorrow
Jody's gone to a rodeo
And I know some good ol' boys are gettin' ready to ride
And it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away
Let the music have its way
Let it steal your heart away
And I know, I know it

Outside me ringin'
The night train is bringing me home
When you hear that locomotion gettin' ready to ride
And it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away
Let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away
And I know, I know it

Outside me ringin'
The night train is bringing me home
When you hear that locomotion gettin' ready to ride
And it's almost Saturday night

Outside my window
Outside, it's almost Saturday night
Outside me ringin'
Outside, it's almost Saturday night

Well, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like it
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
Well, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like it
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
Well, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like it
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
Well, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like it
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
