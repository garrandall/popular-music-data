I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
Itâs been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well Iâm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because youâre standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
Iâm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well Iâm still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, Iâm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because youâre standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Well, Iâm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because youâre standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Iâm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because youâre standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Youâll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
