Got myself a cryin', talkin'
Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her
Just 'cos she's a livin' doll

Got a rovin' eye
And that is why, she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll

Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk
So, no big hunk can steal her away from me

Got myself a cryin', talkin'
Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her
Just 'cos she's a livin' doll

Got a rovin' eye
And that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll

Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me

Got myself a cryin', talkin'
Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her
Just 'cos she's a livin' doll

Got a rovin' eye
And that is why, she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll
