Why did I wake up this morning
When it's just another yesterday
And the forecast for tomorrow
Is some more heartache and sorrow
God make it Lord there ain't no way

Here I am alone and defeated
And here it comes
Just what I needed
Another rainy day in my life
Another rainy day in my life

I believed in you baby
Believed you'd take the weight off me
Why'd you go and hurt
Love me and desert me
Shake my sweet security

Here I am alone and defeated
And here it comes
Just what I needed
Another rainy day in my life
Another rainy day in my life

I'm so tired of living but
I'm so scared of dying alone

Here I am alone and defeated
And here it comes
Just what I needed
Another rainy day in my life
Another rainy day in my life
