One look and I saw what I wanted to see, you know that you
Wrapped my heart around your finger so easily, yeah

With your centerfold body going through the moves
Why did I keep wasting the truth for you, tonight



I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin', 'cos those days are gone, gone

Someone twisted you, so you gave it to me, yeah you gave it to me good
You're a nightmare everywhere, disguised as a dream

Well I got lost, wandering through the darkness in your maze of lies
Your trapdoor-way right into my insides, but tonight

I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'

The tears are falling to the floor, but you won't catch me cryin' anymore
