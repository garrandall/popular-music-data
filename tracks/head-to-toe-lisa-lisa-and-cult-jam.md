Head to toe
I know


Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known?

Who would have thought
That we would become lovers
As friends we were so, so tight

Can't help myself
You make me feel so right
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling


Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you
From head to toe
I know


Here today
Gone tomorrow
It's possible
But I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

He's different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes
Head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

Fourteen karat love
You are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love
Diamonds are forever

Top to bottom
I love you
I will leave you never
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling


Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe


I think I love you from head to toe
You can't hurry love
You got to take it slow

But, my angel
You forget your wings tonight
Baby, you got the love

Fourteen karat love
You are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love
Diamonds are forever

Top to bottom
I love you
I will leave you never
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling


Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I want to kiss you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you
From head to toe
I know

Ooh, baby
I want to kiss you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know

Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe
