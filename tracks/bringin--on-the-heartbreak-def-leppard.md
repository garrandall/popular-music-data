Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty 
The broken rose with laughin' eyes 
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild 
Like a child without a home 
You're always searching, searching for a feeling 
That it's easy come and easy go 

Oh I'm sorry but it's true 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Takin' all the best of me 
Oh can't you see? 
You got the best of me 
Whoah can't you see? 

You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
Can't you see? 

Oh whoah 
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady 
Lady how you hold the key 
Oh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin' 
Burnin' out and burnin' me 

Can't you see? 
Just try and say to you 

You're bringin' on the heartache 
Takin' all the best of me 
Oh can't you see? 
You got the best of me 
Whoah can't you see? 

You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 

Can't you see? 
Can't you see? 
No no no 
You got the best of me 
Oh can't you see? 
You got the best of me 
Whoah can't you see? 

You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak 
Bringin' on the heartache 
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
