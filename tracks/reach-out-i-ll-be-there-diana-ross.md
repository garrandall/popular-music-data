If you feel that
You can't go on
'Cause all your hope is gone

And your life is filled with confusion
And happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumblin' down

Darling, reach out
Reach out, reach out


I'll give you all the love you need
I'll be there
You can always depend on me


I can tell by the way you hang your head
You're without of love
Now you're afraid

And through your tears
You look around
But there's no peace of mind
To be found

I know what you're thinking
You're alone now
No love of your own
Darling, reach out
Reach out for me boy


I'll give you all the love you need
I'll be there
Hey baby, I'm gonna be right there
You can always depend on me

You can always
Depend on me
You can always
When things get tough


You can always cuddle me
See you through
You can always depend on me
Whatever else you do

You can always
Ring my phone
Yeah, you can always catch me at home
You can always cuddle me

You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me

You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me


When you're lost and about to give up
'Cause your best ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold

And you're driftin' on your own
When you need a hand to hold
When you need a little love


Reach out
I'll be there
Reach out
I'll be there
Reach out
I'll be there

To give you all the love you need
I'll try to give you all the love you need
I'll be there to love and shelter you

I'll be there to always see you through
To give you all the love you need
I'm gonna give you all the love you need
I'll be there to love and shelter you

I'll be there to always see you through
To give you all the love you need
I'm gonna give you all the love you need
I'll be there
