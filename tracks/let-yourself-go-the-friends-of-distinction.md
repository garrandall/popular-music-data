I cannot feel guilty for shit that I didn't do
But I can understand the reasons why you think that I should
Yeah I'm white but I never put your neck in no noose
And I never burnt a cross or hid my face with a hood
You can't just label me racist 'cause I'm related to people
Who did some terrible shit way back before I was alive
My parents brought me up to treat everyone as an equal
I refuse to feel ashamed 'cause of my pretty blue eyes
Fuck a nazi, fuck a white supremacist
Fuck anyone who labels me as that because of my family genetics
The hatred for Caucasians is so fucking pathetic
Go be proud that you're black, but don't hate me for some credit
I'm not the white devil, neo-nazi, cop tryna pull the trigger
You can call me what you want but I'd still never say...
The white race as a whole ain't the enemy
There's racist white people but we're far from that collectively

White boy, don't say that
White boy, oh you so bad
White boy you wish you were black
White boy, hey white boy

White boy, white noise
Sayin' shit I can't say with my white voice
White boys, white lies
Don't tell me how to see it through my white eyes

If a black man is sippin' on some Cognac sitting next to me
I don't assume that every blacks favorite drink is Hennessy
I don't dislike Tanesha cause her first name isn't Stephanie
Not only is that wrong, it's a fucking waste of energy
Ivory or ebony, 45 or 17, we all bleed the same
Martin Luther King or Kennedy
They're angry I'm recitin' the facts
He white and he raps, and stole the culture right from the blacks
Okay, he's fire but we lit the flame, he's siphoning gas
So fuck this corny little honky, man, the whitey is wack
You letting history perpetuate the hatred within
And then you paint me with the brush
You painted slave owners with
Yeah

White boy, don't say that
White boy, oh you so bad
White boy you wish you were black
White boy, hey white boy

White boy, white noise
Sayin' shit I can't say with my white voice
White boys, white lies
Don't tell me how to see it through my white eyes

I got a mother, a father, a sister, an auntie and uncle
And a grandma that I picture when you're openly hatin'
And God willing one day, I'll have a kid of my own
I refuse to let you blindly hate my wife or my baby
So go ahead and hate the racists, I pray for their extinction
If you wanna hate the white people, just make a distinction
Between the ones who want the best for everyone regardless
And the ones who built the system just to smother you with hardship
Stop before you say it, I know what you been thinking
Hows a straight white male in 2018 bitching
You're making me the villain by demonizing my race
For things I didn't do and decisions I didn't make
No one that I call a friend has ever owned a slave
And neither did our dad's, or our dads dad's, for fuck sakes
Acknowledging atrocities were wrongly committed
Is all that I can offer when I'm wrongly convicted
I would never hate a man for what God gave him in pigments
And I would never plot against him just because he is different
I would never judge a human for the cards he was given or
Call them lesser than myself cause of the race that he's mixed with
White people that you hate aren't your neighbors or lawyers
They're the Rockafellers, Rothschilds, Bushes, and royals
They're the people who monopolize the water and oil
And injected your communities with drugs 'til they spoil
Got no patience for nazis, I think they're better off dead
They're fighting hatred with hatred makin' the hate more intense
I don't want nothing to do with either side of the fence
So don't blindly attack me for wearing braids on my head
Hate the people who believe you put yourselves in the ghetto
Hate the ones who teach they children you ain't shit cause they said so
Hate the ones who think you're all the same and judge you profusely
'Cause the way that you're portrayed on our news and in movies
Bein' white and bein' racist aren't the same man, I promise
Know it's hard to tell the difference if I'm just being honest
I deserve the chance to show you I'm not part of the problem
And you owe it to yourselves, we got so much in common

White boy, don't say that
White boy, oh you so bad
White boy you wish you were black
White boy, hey white boy

White boy, white noise
Sayin' shit I can't say with my white voice
White boys, white lies
Don't tell me how to see it through my white eyes
