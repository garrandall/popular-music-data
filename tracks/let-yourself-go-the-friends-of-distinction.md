Hey you
You say you got a problem
If you don't mind
I'd like to help you solve them


Why don't you just let yourself go?
Kick off your shoes go walking on a beach now
Let yourself go
Doing little things that will make you feel good now
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go


It's not unusual (it's not unusual)
Everyone has felt blue at times
Not knowing what to do at times
You got to break away (break away, break away)
Oh, break away


Let yourself go
Drop what you're doing, go out and get to moving
Let yourself go
Doing something new that will make you feel groovy
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go


Not knowing what to do at times
You gotta break away
Break away
You've got to break away
You've got to


Let yourself go
Drop what you're doing, go out and get to moving
Let yourself go
Doing something new that will make you feel groovy
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
