We don’t get down like y'all
We don’t get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like y'all

It’s been a lot of back and forth over this and that
Listen, pimpin’, let me tell you what the business is
Y’all and us I’mma tell you what the difference is
See, we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town, gossip like the hoes do
See you name-drop when nobody knows you
We get them lames out our section like we 'posed to
My crew, we cop the Bentley Brookland and the Roll too
You give her roses I’m the one she bring the rose to
So you say you’re shining, well I guess I’m shining more
So high up, I’m soaring, thirty and I’m like a dinosaur
Me to you like a comparing a vet to a cadet, nigga
Don’t call it a comeback
Again ride Benz from the fed pen
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell ‘em get in
Thought I lost a step well guess again
I show you how to make a blessing out of bad breaks
Hoes want their clothes back, listen up fagbait
Them hot pants bad for your prostate
Lime green, hot pink, a drag queen hot date
At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's hip, but where I'm from we call it sissyfied
Before us there were none, after us no more there'll ever be
This the greatest show on Earth you ever see
I still do it for my niggas in the streets, getting to it
Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meech used to do it
Say we’re blowing money fast, big old money bag
Three, four hundred cash just to make them suckers madBeen the best since I was rapping in the rattle,
As you comment on the rumors or what have you
Beware dude, prayer can’t prepare you, how dare you?
Disrespect my presence peasants, I will tear you
A new one, I poop on, your egos and move on
Rolls Royce back seat, no Grey Poupon
A true don, three piece cashmere suit on
Hear the truth on every song I spew on, Bloaw
