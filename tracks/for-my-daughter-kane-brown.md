Someone to play catch with out in the backyard
To pick up the pieces of your first broken heart
Someone to say slow down when you turn sixteen
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

Someone to scare the monsters, when it's dark in your room
Someone to put their foot down when you want a tattoo
And not just say I love you but show you what it means
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself, well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
Teach you how to be sweet like mamma and how to be tough
Yeah, I'll never be perfect but sure as those lines are pink
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself, well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

I can't change the past but the past has sure changed me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
I said I'm gonna be a dad and I'm gonna be the best one I can be
The best one I can be
Love you, baby girl
