Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling supper's hot, y'all come and get it
We yelled five more minutes.

At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interrupting that goodnight kissing,
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
Just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket
Can't you give me five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
All the family gathered 'round knew the time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes

Five more minutes
