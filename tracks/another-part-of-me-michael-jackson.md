We're taking over
We have the truth
This is the mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us


We're sending out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringing brighter days
They're all in line
Waiting for you, can't you see?
You're just another part of me


A revelation
Fulfill the truth
The final message
We'll bring to you
There is no danger
Fulfill the truth
So come together
We need you


We're sending out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringing brighter days
They're all in line
Waiting for you, So know the truth
You're just another part of me

We're sending out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up

You're just another part of me
Another part of me


We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me
