She said, "I need sometime to find myself
I need a little space to think
And maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way too fast for me"
So I picked up what was left of my pride
And I, I put on my walking shoes
And I got up on that high road
And I did what any gentleman would do

I um, I got a brand new girlfriend!
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day lyin' on a beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy 'bout nothin'
Man I think I'm onto somethin'
Because I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend

I love it when she calls me buttercup
She laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops the top for me, a cold beer
And says my buddy's always welcome here
When I get hungry she takes me out
I ridin' shotgun like a Shitzu hound
My tails a waggin' my tongue's hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout

I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day lyin' on a beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy 'bout nothin'
Man I think I'm onto somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend

Woo! Cute cute cute

She likes to write our names in the sand
She's hearing wedding bells and making plans
She's gonna hang around a while I guess
And she hadn't even told me she loves me yet

I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
We fly to LA for the weekend
Spend the whole day lyin' on a beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy 'bout nothin'
Man I think I'm onto somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
She makes me feel just like a kid again
I gotta brand new girlfriend
