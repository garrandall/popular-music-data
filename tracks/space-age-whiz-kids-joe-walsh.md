I used to play that pinball, I used to go outside
I had to spend my money, get on your bus and ride
I used to go out dancing, put on my high-heeled shoes
Get in my short black chevy, go on a downtown cruise
I feel a little bit mixed up, maybe I'm obsolete
All us pinball pool sharks, we just can't compete

Space age whiz kids kids
Leaders in the field
Pioneers of research
Space age whiz kids

Arcade mothership monsters, laserbeam blastshield eyes
Full on space age madness, make-believe satellite skies
Alien ships approaching, there's trouble in sector five
Left hand on the joystick, right hand hyperspace drive

Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids

Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids                                    
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids

They got nothing to do, put another quarter in
Pay those space age dues
Donkey Kong high score, Pac Man's on a roll
Klingons on the warpath, whiz kids on patrol

Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
I like space age whiz kids
I like...I need...I need quarters...quarters!
Give me quarters! I like quarters!
