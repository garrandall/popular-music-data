Together, fore we go
Forever like it was before
Remember, you've been told
Together, we can go
My brother, I watch you go
Like a river, all love has flow
Make your way, don't help me
Don't watch where I go
Make your way, don't help me
Don't watch where I go
Together, fore we go
Forever like it was before
Remember, you've been told
Together, we can go
