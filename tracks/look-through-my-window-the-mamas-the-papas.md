And the rain beats on my roof...
And it does not ask for proof...

It's not that lovers are unkind;
She always said there'd come a time
When one would leave and one stay behind.

We both knew people sometimes change
And lovers sometimes rearrange;
And nothing's quite as sure as change -
And the rain beats on my roof...

Look through my window
To the street below;
See the people hurrying by
With someone to meet, some place to go -
And I know I should let go...

She always said "I'm not like you;
When love is dead, for me it's through
And I will find and love someone new."
(And I will find somebody new)

Look through my window, yeah,
To the street below;
See the people hurrying by
With someone to meet, some place to go -
And I know I should let go...

I must admit she knew her mind;
And it will not take her long to find
Another place where the sun will shine
(Another place where the sun will shine)
(Where the sun will shine, sun will shine...)

And the rain beats on my roof
If I still require proof...
Well, the rain beats on my roof (She's gone)
If I still require proof... (She's gone)
Well, the rain beats on my roof (Look through my window)
If I still require proof
