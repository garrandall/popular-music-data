Baby, baby with your hard luck story
You need a place to show to win
You'd still be waiting for me at the airport
While my ship was coming in
And N.Y. you're taking me dancing...

So "don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing

N.Y., N.Y., you keep me dancing, dancing
N.Y., N.Y., you keep me dancing, dancing

I'm so glad I saw your ad on every avenue
I'm so glad I saw your ad "in every place we drove"
It's a town so nice, they had to name it twice - N.Y., N.Y
It's so hot, so hot, like an old soft shoe

"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing

N.Y., N.Y., you got me dancing, dancing
N.Y., N.Y., you got me dancing, dancing
N.Y., N.Y., you got me dancing, dancing

Instrumental break

Dancing the night away
Oh what a joy at the Barefoot Boy
"Night Trouble Lane's" the place to be
At 12 West the sound's the best
I guess you can come in your jeans
But I still prefer...getting dressed up
But I still prefer getting dressed up for Regine's

"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing
"Don't you beware, don't you beware"
Keep on dancing

N.Y., N.Y., you got me dancing, dancing
Repeat to fade
