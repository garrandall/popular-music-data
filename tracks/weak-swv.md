I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride,
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride,
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
It knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride,
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain
I get so weak
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride,
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
