Half of this morning and most of last night
I've been taking tally on the last years of my life
I've been pretty righteous, but God only knows
A couple of calls were not even close
At least my indiscretions were sweeter than most
Oh, those loving arms
Those sweet, sweet loving arms

Count the bad, count the good
And all I wouldn't change even if I could
I used to stumble back when I was young
And I'm still stumbling but now it's a lot more fun
And I'm falling, I'm falling, I flew too close to the sun
To get your...
Loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms
Your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms

Empty pockets, motel beds
Airline tickets, words better left unsaid
Strange kisses get the ghost
What I miss is what she'll never know
Every day another mountain, another mountain to climb
To get to your...
Loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms
Your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms

And the world could be perfect
Even if we are not
If everything is forgiven
Even if not forgot
And when the morning comes a-breaking
And I call out your name
My heart will be running, oh running to get to your
Loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms
Your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms...
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms
Your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms...
