Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
You're the man.
I know I'll never own you Floy
But see me when you can.

Oh, oh, I know
I'm only one of a million girls
Who would give their world to you Floy Joy.

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

That's your name.
Your real name may be Smith or Jones
But not your claim to fame.

Oh, it's a joy boy!
Any girl who knew you at all
Would have to call you Floy Joy!

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

I get a thrill when I hear your voice now, Floy.

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
You're the man.

How much joy
Do I get from you?
You give me
So much pleasure
It's impossible to measure--

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

You're the man.
I hope in someway form or fashion
I fit in your plan.

Oh, take me!
I wanna give myself to you
And live my whole life through with you
Floy Joy!

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

A-let me hear you say it one more time
Say it again.

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!

A-let me hear you say it one more time
Say it again.

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
