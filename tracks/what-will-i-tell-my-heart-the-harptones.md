Ill try to explain to friends dear
The reason we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends dear
But what will I tell my heart?
Its easy to say to strangers that we played a game from the start
Its easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?
When I smile tonight
All the tears inside
What an ache it will bring
Then ill wander home
To a telephone
That forgot, that forgot how to ring
I say now I could say youll soon be back dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
Ill simply tell them youll soon be back dear
But what will I tell my heart?
I say What? What will I tell my heart?
