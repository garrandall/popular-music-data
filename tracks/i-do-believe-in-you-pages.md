They tried to catch us dancin' on the line
They say we took it way too far this time
They gave us no breaks here, but we made our own I swear
I do, I do believe in you, after all that we've been through
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you), and everything that we do
We used to run with the dangerous crowd
Where the flame was hot and burning out
We knew we'd have to give, it hit us where we lived
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)
After all that we've been through together
You took away my darkest nights (I do believe in you)
When no one else could see the light
(Solo)
Running blind day after day, some things never want to change, ooh
We knew we'd have to give, it hit us where we lived
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you), can't you see
After all that we've been through
You took away my darkest nights (I do believe in you)
When no one else could see the light - yeah
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you), and everything that we do
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you), and everything that we do
