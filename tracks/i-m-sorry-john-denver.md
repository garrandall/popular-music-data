It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking
About you almost everyday

Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again


I'm sorry
For the way things are in China
I'm sorry
Things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me


Our friends all ask about you
I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear
From you almost anytime

But they all know I'm crying
And I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

I'm sorry
If I took some things for granted
I'm sorry
For the chains I put on you

But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you

It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost every day
