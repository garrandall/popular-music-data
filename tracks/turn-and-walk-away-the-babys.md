You still believe you love him
I still believe I'm right
You're lost and I can't find you
You're somewhere in the night

We've got nothing left to talk about
This time it's goodbye
But you can't hurt me anymore
I've no more chance to cry

Walk away
Gonna build our plans to start again
Walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
And walk away

Captivated by you
I'm reaching for your love
Living in your shadow
But that was not enough

You don't seem to care about
The reasons that I give
We'll go fall in love again
Survivors always live

Walk away
Gonna build our plans to start again
Walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
And walk away

I love you
I love you still
I am broken by your words
But I love you still

Walk away
Gonna build our plans to start again
Walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love again
Walk away

Turn around
Turn and walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
Walk away
Turn around
Turn and walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
Walk away
Turn around
Turn and walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
