Hey, hey, hey lover (Oh)
You don't have to be a king
Hey, hey, hey lover (Oh)
You don't have to have a thing

For I'll be satisfied now that you are  my guy
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding

Hey, hey, hey lover (Oh)
You don't have to be a star
Hey, hey, hey lover (Oh)
I love you just the way you are

For love it's just the same
Without fortune and fame
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding

For the rest of my days
No, you don't have to worry
About putting diamonds in my hand
But if you really, really love
In my heart you'd be a big man

Hey lover
Just treat me good and nice 
And it will be alright
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
True love and understanding (Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
True love and understanding (Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
True love and understanding (Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
True love and understanding (Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
