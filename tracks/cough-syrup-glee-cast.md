Life's too short to even care at all oh woah oh,
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' control.
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me waoh oh,
Oh oh oh oh,
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum,
Oh.

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down.

Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now, out of the blue oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh oh oh oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh oh

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now

And so I run now to the things they said could restore me,
Restore life the way it should be.
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down

Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now

So I run now to the things they said could restore me,
Restore life the way it should be.
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down

One more spoon of cough syrup now oh
One more spoon of cough syrup now oh
