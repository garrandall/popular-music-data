I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you
So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
And goin' anywhere as fast as I can

And I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
Oh, and I'm still a far cry from gone

And I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
