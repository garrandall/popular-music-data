I can remember
Not too long ago
I couldn't find my way
I didn't know
Of a place to go
You came along one day
And now with you here to guide me
Stand close beside me
And fill all my hours with day
I'm gonna trade in my sorrow
For each bright tomorrow
And throw all my worries away
Oh I can remember
Not too long ago
I wanted to run away
While I was looking
For a place to go
I found you
That day
And now with you here to guide me
And stand close beside me
And fill all my hours with day
I'm gonna trade in my sorrow
For each bright tomorrow
And throw all my worries away
And now with you here to guide me
And stand close beside me
And fill all my hours with day
I'm gonna trade in my sorrow
For each bright tomorrow
And throw all my worries away
Mmhmm mmhmmm mmm
