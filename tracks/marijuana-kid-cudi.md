Pretty green bud
All in my blunt
Oh I need it
We can take off now
Oh Marijuana, yeah
Pretty green bud
All in my blunt
Oh I need it
We can take off now
Oh I know you wanna
Smoke


I be on it all day like my nigga Big Boi said
That's the only thing that keeps me level up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run run
No fun if not, it's Scotty from the hate mail read
Man I swear, to keep it one hundred
If I ain't have it then I'd be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose
Still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rollin up in the booth
Who got me on another one
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
Well those muthafuckas ain't have this friend
I keep it



La-la-la, yea
La-la-la, yea
La-la-la, yea
Marijuana
La-la-la, yea
La-la-la, yea
La-la-la, yea
I know you wanna, smoke



Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, yea
Always had my back, yea
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Marijuana had my back, my back, woah

Mmm oh oh oh oh
Never left me lonely
It's gon' be ok
Trust me, its gon' be ok
Oh oh oh oh
