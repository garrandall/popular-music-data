Meeting you, with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill
