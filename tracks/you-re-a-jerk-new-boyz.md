"You're a jerk!" I know
"You're a jerk!" I know
"You're a jerk!" I know
"You're a jerk!" I know
"You're a jerk!" New Boyz...
"You're a jerk!" New Boyz...
"You're a jerk!" New Boyz...
"You're a jerk!" New Boyz...
"Jerk"


Jerrrrrk! I'm so cocky with it
I got my eye shut closed like Rocky hit it
Got your girl on my swag she lovin them jerkin songs
Like the new iPod just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin and the waist I'm beatin
Done I got on my way I'm leavin
She like where you goin? I ain't got my shoes and purse
I said it's none of your concern, and she yelled "You're a jerk!"
So I walked out the door, called Ben J
Told him it's a function he said I'm on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e'rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f'real jerk, you lookin for this stuff
And the whole party heard her but all I could hear was


Wah, wah, wah wah wah "You're a jerk!"
Why you trippin? I ain't even do nuttin "You're a jerk!"
"You're a jerk!" I'm a jerk? You ain't never lie
But ay, do me a favor, call me jerk one more time
"You're a jerk!" (I know) "You're a jerk!" (I know)
"You're a jerk!" (I know) "You're a jerk!" (Ay, ay)
"You're a jerk!" (I know) "You're a jerk!" (I know)
"You're a jerk!" (I know) "You're a jerk!" (Ay, ay)
"You're a jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)


Ha ha! .. Everything quiet and the bass real hard
And I stay geeked up never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y'all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I'm a beast, I'm a king, and I guess I'm a jerk
And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt
Man you call me a bother wit'cha lil' jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I'm squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil' stuff
While she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough
So I did it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like where you goin? There's another girl naked
She screamed out loud Ben J. "You're a jerk!"
And I had nothin to say but sorry that it hurts




Hey Brody! (Yeah whattup bro?)
All this jerkin kinda got me feelin geeked up
(Oh f'real?) Yeah dawg I think you might chop somethin up
(Aight f'sho hold up)


"You're a jerk!"


Yeahhh-hahh like that
(Aight.. aiyyo bro) Whattup?
(Ay man what'chu want me to do now?)
Man don't even trip I got it (aight f'sho)

"You're a jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!"
"Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!" (Jerked up, jerked up)
