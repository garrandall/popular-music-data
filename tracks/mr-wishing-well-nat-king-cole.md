(Wishing well, Mr. wishing well
Wishing well, wishing well)

I was standing by the
Wishing well (wishing well)
Feeling all alone and blue
I dropped a penny in the
Wishing well (wishing well)
Wishing for a dream come true

Then down, down went the penny
Right next to all the many others
That lovers had thrown

Won't you help me
Mr. wishing well (wishing well)?
Is it too much that I ask
Just a penny's worth of
Happiness (happiness)?
Is that far too great a task?

Please, send me a
Bundle full of paradise
Make her wonderful and very nice
I'm depending on you
To make my wish come true
(Well, wishing well)

Then I looked up from the
Wishing well (wishing well)
And was I surprised to see
Someone standing by the
Wishing well (wishing well)
Looking just as sad as me

Then our eyes met
What a feeling; I found her
Now I really wanna
Thank you, thank you
Mr. wishing well

(Wishing well, wishing well)
Thank you, Mr. wishing well
(Wishing well, Mr. wishing well)
Thank you, Mr. wishing well
(Wishing well, wishing well)
