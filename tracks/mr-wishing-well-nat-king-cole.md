Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catching up with folks we barely know
Sure it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (take the day off)
Get a massage (get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (a little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (ooh)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (we ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (mhm)
And warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('cause you're the blessin')
Yes, you're the only one I'm wishing for

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?

No, no, no, no
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you
