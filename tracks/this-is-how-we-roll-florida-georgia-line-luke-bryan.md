The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thumb-thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll

Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah, holler at your boy if you need a ride
Let's go
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat, oh
Damn!
Them kisses are for me though,
Automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you
But it's for me though
Let's roll!

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll

LB, go on sing it to 'em!


Yeah, we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day

'Cause this is how we roll
Come ya'll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up
We light it up with our hands up

This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside,
Baby, this is how we roll

Yeah, this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah, baby
Yeah, LB
Let's go

Yeah, this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon,
Baby, this is how we roll
BK, Tyler, LB, baby
One more time
Let's go
Yeah, this is how we roll
