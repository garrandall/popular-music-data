I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess its right, it's so amazing
Everytime I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch, when we love
The stars line up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
When mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind

I wanna be inside your heaven
Oh yes I do

I wanna be inside your heaven
