(Ooh)
Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex (ooh)
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex (serve)
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet (wet)
Wanna kick with the gang, you gotta bang it (it's lit)
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it (ice)
Hoes in the world, I can not hang it (nah)
Pour different colours, sip it, taint it (ooh)
Whole thing of vultures start vibratin' (rawr)

Don't do playgrounds, we do not swing sets (swing)
Shawty got the kado and the tame threats
Shawty came my way she brought the same sex
Bust it down, she talkin' body language (it's lit)
Eating that pootang got my bangs wet (eat it up)
We gon' have to change for the banquet (drippin')
Solo with Mussain is not the same specs (skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up, left with something I ain't came with (alright)

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, ice, froze, go, get, gone
Get gone


Three main bitches thinkin' they my main bitch (21, 21)
Hit the club and swap the hoes I came with (straight up, straight up)
Don't you come outside, we on that gang shit (straight up, straight up)
Had to switch my t-shirt 'cause she stained it (on God)
Had to buy a visa, she from Moscow (21)
Fuckin' 'round with Travis, you get crossed out (crossed out)
He used to be on that nigga off now (He off now)
I done got so rich, I Saint Laurent my dogs now (straight up, straight up)
Earrings cost a quarter certified by GIA (21)
If it's 'bout my bae or 'bout some smoke I'm on my way (skrrt, skrrt)
Your bitch gave the kid Cudi but Iâm not signed to Ye (on God)
I nutted on her cheek, her new nickname is Baby Face (21)


Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex (ooh)
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex (serve)
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet (wet)
Wanna kick with the gang, you gotta bang it (it's lit)
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it (ice)
Hoes in the world, I can not hang it (nah)
Pour different colours, sip it, taint it (ooh)
Whole thing of vultures start vibratin' (rawr)
