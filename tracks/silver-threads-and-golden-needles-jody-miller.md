I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I wantâ€™s the love you promised
Beneath the halo'd moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating games

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I cannot drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I cannot drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine

You can't buy my love with money
For I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
