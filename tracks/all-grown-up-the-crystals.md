Well I'm all grown up
Ain't no baby no more
I can do the things
I couldn't do before
No more pony-tails
I wear my hair up high
Because I'm seventeen
And that's the reason why

Now I'm all grown up and I'll go where I wanna go
See who I wanna see, stay out late
I'm all grown up and I'll do what I wanna do
Be what I wanna be, neat, I can hardly wait

Well I'm going on dates
Every Saturday night
And if he wants a kiss
I might say all right
I got my high heels on
And I'm a-ready to go
I'm gonna go down town
I'm gonna steal the show

Now I'm all grown up and I'll go where I wanna go
See who I wanna see, stay out late
I'm all grown up and I'll do what I wanna do
Be what I wanna be, neat, I can hardly wait

All grown up and I'll go where I wanna go
See who I wanna see, stay out late
I'm all grown up and I'll do what I wanna do
Be what I wanna be, neat, I can hardly wait

Gee, I can hardly wait
