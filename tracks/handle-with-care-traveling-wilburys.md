I've been beat up and I've been battered 'round
I've been sent up and I've been shot down
You're the best thing I've ever found
Handle me with care

Reputations changeable
Situations tolerable
Baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?

Everybody got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine and dream on

I've been fobbed off and I've been fooled
And I've been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and in night schools
Handle me with care

I've been stuck in airports and terrorized
Sent to meetings and hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?

Everybody got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine and dream on

I've been uptight and I made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care

I've been beat up and I've been battered 'round
I've been sent up and I've been shot down
But you're the best thing I've ever found
Handle me with care
