Oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey

I notice there's a look
Of doubt in your eye
When you see me talking
To other guys
And I just don't understand why

You must try to understand
That those other guys
Are just my friends
And they all know that
You're my man, oh, oh

I wouldn't lie to you
I would never lie to you
I wouldn't lie to you
You know I'd never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being jealous)
I would never lie to you
(Wanna stay your only friend)

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being insecure)
You know I'd never lie to you
(Don't wanna lose her love, that girl)

I love you far too much
To let you down
And you should know that
I would never mess around
So there's no need for you
To wear that frown

You must try to understand
That those other guys
Are just my friends
And they all know that
You're my man, oh, oh

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being jealous)
I would never lie to you
(Wanna stay your only friend)

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being insecure)
You know I'd never lie to you
(Don't wanna lose her love, that girl)

I, I, I, I, I

I wouldn't, I wouldn't
I wouldn't lie to you
You know I'd never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
I would never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
I'd never lie to you, no

I would never

I wouldn't lie to you
You're the only one for me
And I would never, never
Never, never, never

I wouldn't lie to you
(I'd never lie to you, no, no)
I would never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
You know I'd never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
I would never, never
Never, never let you down

I would never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Never, never

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being jealous)
I would never lie to you
(Wanna stay your only friend)

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being insecure)
You know I'd never lie to you
(Don't wanna lose her love, that girl)
