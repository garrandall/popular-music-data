Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I'm about to blow my top
Hah, hah
Don't give a damn
Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah
Thank you, ma'am

Got no phone
Got no heat, too
Late last night electricity blew
Seems like things are going wrong
Stay in bed all day long

Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I'm about to blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
All this shit has got to stop

I know people work hard all day
All they get is a little bit of pay

Went to the bank
To get me a loan
Try to buy me a brand new home
Bank told me I got no credit
Guess I got to just forget it

And at night I dream
I dream I'm far, far away
Dancing with mermaids
And in the morning
When I get up
I find I'm right back
Where I always been
But I keep on dreamin'
Nobody better try to take
My dream away from me

Come on

Ahh, ahh

Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
Oo-ee-diddley-dop
I ain't gonna blow my top
