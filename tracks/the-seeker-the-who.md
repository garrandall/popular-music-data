I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I'm tryin to find the key
To fifty million fables


They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die


I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either


They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die


People tend to hate me
Because I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand

Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man




I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die


I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah but look at my face ain't this a smile

I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I got values but I don't know how or why


I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do


They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
