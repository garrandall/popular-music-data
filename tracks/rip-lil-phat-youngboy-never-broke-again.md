RIP Lil Phat (Lil Trouble made the beat, he only had to play it once)
Ooh that bitch turnt up, what you on? What you on?
What you talkin' 'bout, Zo?
What you tryna do, huh?
You act like, you act like you ain't been a gangster
Bitch, you know I been a gangster, yeah
You ain't even gotta turn me up like that, boy, yeah
You know what's happenin' with me, free DDawg, ain't nobody safe
Let's go

Rollin' off them pills, steady spinnin', bitch, I'm rollin'
Tryna pop a nigga cap, that's off the flat, they be controllin'
If them niggas get to poppin', then just know he got it on him
I ain't gotta point 'em out, my niggas get him if I want him
Hold on, yeah, I'm in a zone, yeah
My niggas rollin' off them pills to get you gone, yeah
And bitch, I been that, I'm still is, so watch your tone, yeah
Bust your fuckin' dome, yeah, send your ass home, yeah

Nigga, ain't no temptin' me, watch me do my murder dance
30 Glock up in his pants, fuck the cops, he stretch your mans
He say he need another one, he just took another Xan'
He say he gon' step on us, he gon' need another plan
Dirty as a motherfucker, still come through fuckin' swervin' (Boom, nigga)
Out the roof up in this bitch, who said I was worried? (Who said I was worried?)
I get trey like back to back, they shoot that bitch like Curry
Behind the line, a couple stacks'll probably get 'em early, hold on

Rollin' off them pills, steady spinnin', bitch, I'm rollin'
Tryna pop a nigga cap, that's off the flat, they be controllin'
If them niggas get to poppin', then just know he got it on him
I ain't gotta point 'em out, my niggas get him if I want him
Hold on, yeah, I'm in a zone, yeah
My niggas rollin' off them pills to get you gone, yeah
And bitch, I been that, I'm still is, so watch your tone, yeah
Bust your fuckin' dome, yeah, send your ass home, yeah

Wan' do somethin' with who? I got that tool up in this bitch (On slime)
We can go to scufflin' since you bootin' in this bitch (I ain't lyin')
Flash out and make it ugly, ain't no movin' in this bitch (Bitch, what up?)
I'm gonna shoot a horror movie, ain't no choosin', ain't no picks
I'ma go across your shit with this Henny bottle, nigga
Still be with the shits, just since I left the bottom, nigga
Put you up with your clique, you fuckin' with the Dada, nigga
Bust your ass, that's a fact, ain't 'bout no fuckin' dollar, nigga
How I come through on them jiggas

Rollin' off them pills, steady spinnin', bitch, I'm rollin'
Tryna pop a nigga cap, that's off the flat, they be controllin'
If them niggas get to poppin', then just know he got it on him
I ain't gotta point 'em out, my niggas get him if I want him
Hold on, yeah, I'm in a zone, yeah
My niggas rollin' off them pills to get you gone, yeah
And bitch, I been that, I'm still is, so watch your tone, yeah
Bust your fuckin' dome, yeah, send your ass home, yeah
