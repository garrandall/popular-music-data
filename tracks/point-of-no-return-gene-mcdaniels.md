You know that once upon a time
I didn't need you so
It would have been so easy then
For me to turn and go

But now there's no leavin' you
I know that for a fact
I'm at the point of no return
And for me there'll be no turning back

I told myself you'd always be
A habit I could break
But now a day without your kiss
Would be so hard to take

You just can't get off a train
That's movin' down the track
I'm at the point of no return
And for me there'll be no turning back

Once I could have said goodbye
But that was at the start
Now I think I'd rather die
Than be the one to say, "We'll part"

Maybe you will break my heart
Or maybe you'll be true
No matter what the future brings
I've got to see it through

Maybe your love for me is nothin' but an act
I'm at the point of no return
And for me there'll be no turnin' back
Yeah, for me there'll be no turnin' back
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh
