Oh,Yeahhhh,I'm wishin' on a fallin' star,
wonderin' where you are...I wish...



I wish for you on a fallin' star,wonderin'
where you are,do I ever cross your mind,In
the warm sunshine,she's from the city of angels,like
Betty Davis,James Dean,and Gable,never know
what she means to me.I fell for the girl that's on TV.



Met her at a counter affair,she wore a green dress,and
everybody was there,felt out of place till she looked
into my eyes.Shook your hand around 9 P.M. about
never gonna be the same again.Never had to
be on a movie screen to be the leading lady
in all my dreams...
Shooby-doo-wop,and scobby snacks,met a fly girl
and I can't relax,the only problem is she's
a movie star,Oh,my friends,they won't believe me,if
they could only see me,at the risk of sounding
cheesy,i think I fell for the girl on TV.





Everybody knows her name,Wanna take a picture and
their glad she came,But I just want to be there when
she's down,down(Be there when she's down)
I don't want her autograph,I just want to call her up
and make her laugh,Never had to be on a movie
screen,To be the leading lady in all my dreams.
Shooby doo-wap & scooby snacks,
I Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star,
Oh,My friends they won't believe me
If they could only see me,At the risk of sounding
cheezy,I think I fell for the girl on TV.

I'm wishin' on a star...and wonderin' where you are
Do I cross your mind??In the warm sunshine???



Yeah,So I wish for you on a bright shining star,
Every where I look there you are,There you are
It's the girl in the green dress,
She took my breath away,And now I look to the sky,
For a better day,To the beach shore and scooby snacks,
I met a fly girl and I can't relax,
Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams,I wish
