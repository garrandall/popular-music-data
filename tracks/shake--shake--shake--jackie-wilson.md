Come on and shake awhile
Come on and drive me wild
Get out and on the floor
Shake it out til your feet get sore, yeah
Cmon baby
Drive me crazy
Come around now
Hey, when you begin to move
You put me in a dancin groove
I want to jump and shout
Were actually workin out, yeah
Cmon baby
Drive me crazy
Ah-righ
Yeah, girl you're lookin good
You're lookin like I know you could
You're really knockin em dead
You got me talkin out of my head, yea-ah
Cmon baby
Drive me crazy
Work it out mama, ah-right
Cmon
Shake it up, now
Do the twist now woman
Mash them potatoes
Ah, you're lookin good
Like I know you could
Skippin cross the floor
Ah, you're hot
Talk to me mama
Why not all night long
Yeah baby shake, shake, shake
Yeah, twist-twist-twist shake, shake, shake
Twist, twist, twist shake, shake, shake
Twist, twist, twist shake, shake, shake
Cmon woman fade
