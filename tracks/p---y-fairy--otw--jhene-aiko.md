Ooh-wee, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you love fuckin' me (Fuckin' me, fuckin' me)
I can tell by the way you're in love with me (Love with me)
You can't get enough of me, yeah
Well, I guess it's looking like you stuck with me

'Cause I got you sprung off in the spring time
Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That dick make my soul smile
That dick make me so damn proud (So damn proud)

Now lay your head down on the pillow
Turn the lights down real low
I want you to say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're getting real close
Baby, I am on the way

Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down

Don't be surprised baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this pussy (Pussy)
Now you feel like you can fly

I got you sprung off in the spring time
Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That dick make my soul smile
That dick make me so proud, ooh

Now lay your head down on the pillow
I'ma fuck you real slow
Need to hear you say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're getting real close
Baby, I am on the way

Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down

Don't be surprised baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this pussy (Pussy)
Now you feel like you can fly

I got you sprung off in the spring time
Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That dick make my soul smile
That dick make me so proud, ooh, I
