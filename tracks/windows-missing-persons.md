Something feels so strange tonight
It's not wrong but it's just not right
Some hidden complications, fill me with hesitation

And it gets so dark in here
I can't see through doubts and fears
Walled in by expectation, I need a deviation
Change in perspective, alternative view
To help me see clearly, observe something new

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

Outside the world's so dangerous
It's hard to find someone to trust
Fills me with reservation deives me into hibernation
I watch whats going on
But I don't want to belong
Leave me in my introspection
Safely behind protection

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through

It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

Looking through windows at the world
Looking through windows at the world
Safe behind windows from the world
Safe behind windows from the world
Watching my window world go by
Just watching my window world go by
Without my window who am I
Without my window who am I

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

All I want
All I want is a window to look through
All I want
All I need is a window to look through
All I need
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway

All I want is a window to look through
All I need is a window to look through
It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway
