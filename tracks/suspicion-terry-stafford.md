Every time you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Every time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
You really, really, really love me
Do you say the same words
To someone else when I'm not there


(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?


Every time you call me
And tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
You're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just
Keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful
Whenever you are out of sight?


(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?


Darling, if you love me
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind
Why can't our romance just
Keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
'Cause true love is so hard to find


(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?
