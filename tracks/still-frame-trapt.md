Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out
Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

And every time I think I've finally made it
I learn I'm farther away than I have ever been before
I see the clock and its ticking away
And the hourglass empty
What the fuck do I have to say?

Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out
Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

Keep it inside, the image portrayed
As if I couldn't stand losing, as if I couldn't be saved, no way
A small confession, I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need
A small reflection on when we were younger
We had it all figured out, ‘cause we had everything covered
Now we're older, it's getting harder to see
What this future will hold for us?
What the fuck are we going to be?

Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out
Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

Lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost
I'm just as lost as you
What am I going to do?

I'm afraid I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther from where I wanna be
I'm afraid I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away

Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out
Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down
This picture's frozen, and I can't get it out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
Now I'm breaking it down
I'm just as lost as you
Now I'm breaking it down
