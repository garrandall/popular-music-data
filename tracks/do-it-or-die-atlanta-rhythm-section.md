Don't let your troubles make you cry
Don't waste a moment wonderin' why
When everything goes wrong, you have to go on
And do it or die

Do it or die now, stand your ground
Don't let your bad breaks go gettin' you down
Even when times get rough
And you've had enough
You still gotta try
That's right

Do it no matter what the people say
(It don't matter)
They don't even know you
(They don't know you at all)
Die before you let them stand in your way
(Don't you know that)
You should know that

Life is a gamble all along
Winners are losers who keep rollin' on
So go on and roll the dice
You only live twice
Do it or die

Do it no matter what the people say
(It don't matter)
They don't even know you
(They don't know you at all)
Die before you let them stand in your way
(Don't you know that)
I know that
(You know that)

Life is a gamble all along
Winners are losers who keep rollin' on
Just go on and roll the dice
You only live twice
So do it or die

You got nothin' to lose
Just go on and roll the dice
You only live twice
Do it or die
