Here's to teenage memories
Here's to teenage memories

Can I call, wake you up on a Sunday?
Late night, I think we need a getaway
Headlights, hold tight, turn the radio loud
(turn the radio loud)

Let me know where to go and I'll get you there
Tell the truth and I'll show you how to dare
Flashlights, held tight, we can own this town

Never say goodbye

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
'Cause I don't know
If I can let you go

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives
Here's to teenage memories
Here's to teenage memories

Close your eyes you'll be mine and it's alright
Take a breath, no rest 'til the sunrise
Heartbeat, so sweet when your lips touch mine

We don't have to go home right now
We're never gonna stop 'cause we're dreaming out loud
We know what we want, we know we're gonna get it somehow

Never say goodbye

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
'Cause I don't know
If I can let you go

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives
Here's to teenage memories
Here's to teenage memories

And so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
'Cause I don't know
If I can let you go

So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives
Here's to teenage memories

Here's to teenage memories
Here's to teenage memories
