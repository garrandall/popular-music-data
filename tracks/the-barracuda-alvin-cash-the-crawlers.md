And The Crawlers

Everybody do the
(Do what, baby)
Come on and do the Barracuda

B-a-r-r-a-c-u-d-a

Here's a dance to do
Here's a dance that's new
The Barracuda

Once you get with it, oh, oh
You know you can't quit it, no, no

Come on, put it all to work
(What you gonna do)
We're gonna have a ball

Form a big loss line
And keep in time
The Barracuda (have mercy)

Jump up, baby, jump back
Jump up, jump back

Kick it to the left
Kick it to the right
Move up, move back

Now you've tried it, baby
Now you've learned
The Barracuda, ooh wee

Ooh wee, ooh wee
(Have mercy, baby)
Ooh wee
(Oh, but you're looking good)
Ooh wee
(Oh, come on, baby)

Ooh, ah ah, ooh, ah ah
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah

B-a-r-r-a-c-u-d-a

Here's a dance to do
Here's a dance that's new
The Barracuda
