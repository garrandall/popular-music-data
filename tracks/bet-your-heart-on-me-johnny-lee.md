You took a chance on him
He broke your heart and left you crying
You lost your will to love again
Oh, you ain't even tryin'

All you need is someone
Who will love you tenderly
Well, here I am so take my hand
And bet your heart on me

You can bet your heart on me
Honey, you can be a winner
Forget about the last time out
You were just a beginner

But don't be afraid 'cause you've got it made
If you just let it be
So, lay your love down one more time
And bet your heart on me

Love is more than just a game
That's why it hurts so much to lose it
I've got something for the pain
So why don't you use it?

Lucky star's are shinning
Shinning so you can believe
That my love is a sure thing, girl
So bet your heart on me

You can bet your heart on me
Honey, you can be a winner
Forget about the last time out
You were just a beginner

But don't be afraid 'cause you've got it made
If you just let it be
So lay your love down one more time
And bet your heart on me

You can bet your heart on me
Honey, you can be a winner
Forget about the last time out
You were just a beginner

But don't be afraid 'cause you've got it made
If you just let it be
