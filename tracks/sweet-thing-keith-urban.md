When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were drivin' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were lookin at me.

I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my..

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishin
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleepin
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leavin
Til we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..

Standin here feeling like a love struck romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishin
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleepin
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leavin
Til we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Sweet thing, sweet thing..

Oh my sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and tell me I'm not dreamin
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleepin
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leavin
Til we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Oh cmon sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing..

Yeah, cmon now a little now..
Do do do do doo do do do do do do
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are
Do do do do doo do do do do do do
