That's right Icey Jadakiss... ya heard let's get it on.


You got a house on the hill. 
Chromed out ride you live that life giving me everything that I dream. 
All the time on a creep first class flights, sea in sight all night. 
Never thought that this could ever take control of me.


Day and Night I know what to do. 
Your always on mind dreaming of you it feels so right but I know that it's wrong. 
That I know I got a man just can't leave you alone.


Quiet nights on the sand, private beach, 
shopping sprees, diamond rings, all the things that I can't get at home. 
Never could understand a thing like me to up and leave for material things. 
I'm caught up in love of a secret life.


Day and Night I know what to do. 
Your always on mind dreaming of you it feels so right but I know that it's wrong. 
That I know I got a man just can't leave you alone.


Never thought that I could ever feel this way. 
All the things that I believed in went away. 
Right from the start you took my heart I'm in love what can I say.


A yo you just can't leave me alone see me alone the Porche is black the B's 
is chrome he's at home you with me its the 4.63 cribs and some jewerly. 
Don't worry I can put you through school for free so if that's cool with you it's cool with me. 
Princess Shaneti tennis your wrist anything you wish Icey and Kiss you thinking of me 
so what you really got him for let's go to the mall and close down the Prada store and even 
if you don't rock diamonds maybe you would like to go deep sea fishin' 
and rock climbin' pop wine and horse-back ridin' you shot gun scared cause the Porche 
back slidin' and your friends say that Jay aint right but you know we go together like day and night.


Day and Night I know what to do. 
Your always on mind dreaming of you it feels so right but I know that it's wrong. 
That I know I got a man just can't leave you alone.
