Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me


Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please


Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me


He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free


Come together, right now
Over me


Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me


He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease


Come together, right now
Over me


Shoot me
Shoot me
Right!

Come, come, come, come


He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three."
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see


Come together, right now
Over me


Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Ugh!


Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Uh...
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together...
