It seems like every dayâs the same
and Iâm left to discover on my own
It seems like everything is gray
and thereâs no color to behold
They say itâs over and Iâm fine again, yeah
Try to stay sober feels like Iâm dying here

And I am aware now of how
everythingâs gonna be fine one day
Too late, Iâm in hell I am prepared now,
seems everyoneâs gonna be fine
One day too late, just as well

I feel the dream in me expire
and thereâs no one left to blame it on
I hear you label me a liar
âcause I canât seem to get this through
You say itâs over, I can sigh again, yeah
Why try to stay sober when Iâm dying here

And I am aware now of how
everythingâs gonna be fine one day
Too late, Iâm in hell
I am prepared now,
seems everyoneâs gonna be fine
One day too late; just as well

And Iâm not scared now.
I must assure you,
youâre never gonna get away
And Iâm not scared now.
And Iâm not scared now. Noâ¦

I am aware now of how
everythingâs gonna be fine one day
Too late, Iâm in hell
I am prepared now
seems everyoneâs gonna be fine
One day too late, just as well
I am prepared now,
seems everythingâs gonna be fine for me
For me; for myself.
For me, for me, for myself
For me, for me, for myself

I am prepared now for myself
I am prepared now and I am fine... again
