If it wasn't for the money
Cars and movie stars and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me
(Want you)
Would you still be calling me
(Still calling you)
You'll be loving me
(I'll be loving you)

Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy, trust me I know
When gangstas and hoes
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars, a crib with east and west wing
Cuz this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it, how to prey on my weakness
Cuz the power of the p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggas wonderin' it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphim, who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-N-C

If it wasn't for the money
Cars and movie stars and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me
(Want you)
Would you still be calling me
(Still calling you)
You'll be loving me
(I'll be loving you)

How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status, player status
Pimps that get ya boy half rich
'Fore we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull up in them hot cars
Go and buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-i-a
Shut the game down so the bustas can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been thru
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
It's mighty strange how you right back here

If it wasn't for the money
Cars and movie stars and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me
(Want you)
Would you still be calling me
(Still calling you)
You'll be loving me
(I'll be loving you)

I wonder why love is about money
And why you wanna take it all from me, honey
My life is dark but it's lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Y'all bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New benzes new porsches
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's no wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
It's kinda funny how you right back here

If it wasn't for the money
Cars and movie stars and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me
(Want you)
Would you still be calling me
(Still calling you)
You'll be loving me
(I'll be loving you)
