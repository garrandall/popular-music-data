I don't have to think about it
I've never been in love
I've only dreamed about it
I wondered what it was

But now I think I know it's clear to me
You've made me understand
I'm so proud to say I love you,
And I'm so proud to be your man,
Yes I am.

I promise I'll never hurt you
I'll never make you cry
No

I promise I'll never hit you
Cross my heart and hope to die
I know I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you warm
I'll keep you satisfied
Be your sunshine in the morning
Be your everything at night


You told me what you wanted
I gave you what you needed
I told ya that I'd love you, make it good for you and me
I never make a promise that I can't keep, that ain't me

Ain't no way to get around it
No cause now you're stuck with me
Did you know that yo'd be surrounded
By my love and ecstacy
This is the staart of one great love afair
That never, never, never gonna end
We can share the world together
This is where it begins



Girl, I'll stand by you, if you give me your hand
I'll make love to you baby, Your wish is my command
Let play out your fantasies I'll make you u lose your mind
Take you places you ain't never been before,
I promise you in time



If I make a promise to you
Then baby thats what Ill do
I got nothin to loose
Ill give my whole world to you

I never make a promise that I can't keep

I'm a man of my word
And you my moreest concern
Thay you'll never be hurt
It's for better or worst

I never make a promise that I can't keep
