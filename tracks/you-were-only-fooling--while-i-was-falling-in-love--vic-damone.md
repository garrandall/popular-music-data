You were only fooling
While I was falling in love
It's a story as old as Adam and Eve
I was making love
But you were making believe
You lied to me with kisses
That I was once dreaming of
You were only fooling, dear
While I was falling in love

You were only fooling
While I was falling in love
It's a story as old as Adam and Eve
I was making love
But you were making believe
You lied to me with kisses
That I was once dreaming of
You were only fooling, dear
While I was falling in love
