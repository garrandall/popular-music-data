In my truck flying down a dirt road
Pickin' you up, feelin' kinda crazy
I think I'm in luck cause I know my baby

She slaps my knee says: "boy why you smiling?"
Doing my best so hard to hide it
I know what's up, so I just shoot her a wink

Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

When we're past Flint Bridge, we'll break out the bottle
Drop it down low, crank up the throttle I'm good to go, cause I've got you tonight baby

Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight, baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

Sitting on this hill with her
Looking in them baby blues
Wishing that the sky would change
I've been thinking about it all damn day
I can hardly wait

Cause when the sun goes down it'll get a little hotter
Make an old boy's heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause it's going down smooth tonight baby
One ain't enough man may I have another Sitting 'round the fire gettin' drunk on each other
Every day I pray I thank God I got her She's the moon in my shine, the whiskey in my water

Whiskey in my water
Whiskey in my water yeah yeah yeah
