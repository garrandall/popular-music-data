I just don't want it to pass me by


Pass me not oh gentle savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by


There's something special about the way that You hold me make me you shake me you take me than you mold me
But in my hE‰art in my soul and in my spirit
The love of god every day I've gotta be near it
He took me to the water I went down in your name
I repented all my sins
I haven't been the same
My knees started shaking
My legs had to run
His love touched my heart
And his spirit lifted my tongue
Lifted my tongue
II love the lord until the day that I die so please! please! please! Don't pass me by sing!


While on others thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by


I've got the feeling but the feeling's not the same
I did a little hip hop the hammer and the jam
But a touch, a touch from up above
And I've got the feeling of your love reachin' out - reachin' out!
And callin' for some people
Who keep us all safe from this world that's full of evil trying! Trying!
Lord some times I'm crying
The son gives his life, the people are still denying
When I think of the best and what he's done for me my soul cries hallelujah!
Thanks for saving me! Sing!


While on others thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by


Savior savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by


Do not - pass me by…

I need him! I need him!


While on others thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by
