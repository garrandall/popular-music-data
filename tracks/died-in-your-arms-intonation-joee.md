Oh i, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something
I can't get broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed
The cats in the cradle who would've thought
That a boy like me could come to this

Oh i, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh i, I just died in your arms tonight

It must've been some kind of kiss I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on a list I try to be discreet
But then blow it again
I've lost and found
It's my final mistake she's loving by proxy
No give and all take 'cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.

Oh i, I just died in your arms...
It was a long hot night she made it easy
She made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head
I know I was wrong
Oh i, I just died in your arms...
