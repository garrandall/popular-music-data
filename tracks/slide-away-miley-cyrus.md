Once upon a time it was paradise
Once upon a time I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbour lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby we were found but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
Nahh nah nah you'll slide away
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
Nahh nah nah youâll slide away

Once upon a time it was paradise
Once upon a time I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbour lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time it was made for us
Woke up one day it had turned to dust
Baby we were found but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

Move on, we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything's changed
You're right, we're grown now

So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
Nahh nah nah you'll slide away
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean
Nahh nah nah you'll slide away

Move on we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything's changed
You're right, we're grown now
