I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Now I've heard a crying man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weeping
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
(Don't you go away)
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

(Don't you go away)
(Don't you go away)

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Put yourself in my place
I only for a little while
Come on, try it, come on, try it
Come on, try it (try it, try it, try it)
Put yourself in my place
I only for a little while
Come on, try it, come on, try it
Come on, try it (try it, try it, try it)

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
