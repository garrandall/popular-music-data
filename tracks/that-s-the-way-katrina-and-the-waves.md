Darlin' I'm telling you
One thing I believe is true
Is that I'm always gonna love you
And everything you say and do
Oh, darlin' I'm telling you
One thing I believe is true
That until the end of never
Gonna be in love forever

To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old
To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old

Darlin' I've gotta say
If you can love me my way
I'll always treat you tender
And with such sweet surrender
Darlin' believe me
If ever thought you'd leave me
I'd cry so many teardrops
I'll cry and cry and never stop

To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old
To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old

Oh, darlin' to have and to hold
I'm gonna love you, heart and soul
With a love that will never grow cold
Forever and ever and ever to have and to hold

Darlin' I'm telling you
One thing I believe is true
Is that I'm always gonna love you
In everything you say and do

To have and to hold
Mmm...
By your side
By your side
Ooh...

To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old
To have and to hold
By your side I will never grow old
To have and to hold
To have and To have and to hold
