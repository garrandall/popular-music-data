Slow your lovin' up
Slow your lovin' down

Love gaining not losin' ground
No worry
No hurry
Take your sweet time
Baby
Dabble dally
Shilly shally
Slow down this ain't a race car rally

Bit by bit
Inch by inch
Cool your heels
We're hangin' fire

That's the way
That's the way
That's our love in slow motion

That's the way
Like the way
That's our love in slow motion

Strolling when we walk
Whisper when we talk

Grass growing right up under our feet
Oh stay
Lover
Delay
Lover
Take a little more time with me

That's the way
That's the way
That's our love in slow motion
...

Slow down greased lightning
Make love
Gentle not frightening

Deep down devotion
That's our love in slow motion

Lighten up and lay your rocket down

Little by little
Not in leaps and bounds
Ride at anchor restin' on your oars

A little laissez-fair
Honey
More
More
More
More !

That's the way
That's the way
That's our love in slow motion
...
