Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond


Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky


I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes


So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky


Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky


Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky


At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes


So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky


Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky


Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond


So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky


Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond
Oh-oh, yeah
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
