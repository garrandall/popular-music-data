Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say
That I loved you
Then I realized that
It was just my mind playing tricks on me

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe
That we're through


I miss you
(I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
And I
And I can't deny it

I miss you
(I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me


Is it done
And over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?

But it's our first love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe
That you don't care

I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now
(Over now)
Be strong
(Be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone
I've got to carry on
