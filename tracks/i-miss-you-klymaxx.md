Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved to, then I realized
And it was just my mind playing tricks on me
It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Everytime the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
And I just can't believe
That we're through

I miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I, I can't deny it
I miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Is it done and over this time?
Can we really change our minds?
But it's our first love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe that you don't care

I miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I, I can't deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see

I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now be strong
I can't believe that you're gone
I've got to carry on

I miss you (I miss you)
It's driving me crazy
I don't wanna live without you
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and
I miss you (I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
(And I) and I can't deny it
I miss you (boy, I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

(I can't believe you're gone)
