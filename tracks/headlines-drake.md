I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ohI needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, (aye) please don't do it, (aye) 'cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it (aye)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

Yeah, I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that?" but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know that they ain't even got it like that.
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)!"
Tell 'em I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know
