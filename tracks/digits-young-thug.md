Thugger! YSL for life
We ran up the digits, we ran up the money
We ran up the digits, we ran up the money
We ran up some digits...
We got London on da Track!


Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...


We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up some digits, we ran up some money


I'm leanin' like I'm on a fifth of the Henny
I talk lots of shit like my bitches and digits
They didn't know me well so I left 'em with wishes
You know its a drought when you grind and can't flip it
I'm livin' big, I swear to God I'm Liu Kang kickin'
Montana
Mama gon' slime, hustle
Dopeboy, hair grey like a grandma
You know my ice blingin', light up just like a candle
Rollie pollie, I can control shawty like a channel
My racks are squeakin', I'm not fartin'
I hop in that 'Rari, I crank up like Warren


Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...


We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up some digits, we ran up some money


I'ma move me some dope like I'm Future
I'ma go in that bitch with a ruler
I'ma toast me a nigga like Strudels
I'ma keep a red flag 'cause I'm boolin'
I know some roller spaces, I could dually
Yeah, yeah, I'm screamin' oh my god like Cooly
When I snort it, I feel like I was aborted
If I ever die, he better drop his first
I've been gettin' money before the music, fuck Pandora
I just do this shit when I get bored


Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...


We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up some digits, we ran up some money


We got London on da Track!
