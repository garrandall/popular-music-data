Like a honeybee beating on my screen door,
I got a little buzz and my head is sore,
And from my bed I can feel the sun,
Lord I hear the morning come.

Just a creepin'
Creepin', creepin', creepin'.

You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun,
A flip of a switch,
A thief on the run,
And since the day you left me baby,
I can feel the lonely,
I can hear the crazy.

Just a creepin'
Creepin'
Just a creepin'
Creepin'

Head for the future,
Run from the past,
Hide from the mirror,
And live in a glass,
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers,
Kinda like molasses in late December.

Just a creepin'
Creepin'
Oh, creepin'

 Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love,
 Your caffeine kiss and nicotine love,
Got under my skin and into my blood,
That need you back comes over me,
Like ivy crawlin' up a hickory tree.

Just a creepin'
Creepin'
Just a creepin' creepin'
Creepin'

Head to the future,
Run from the past,
Hide from the mirror,
And live in a glass,
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers,
Kinda like molasses in late December.

Just a creepin'
Creepin'
Ah, come on!

Break it down, down, down, down...

Just last night I saw the light,
At the end of that tunnel on the other side,
Thought I found my way outta this pain,
Only to find your memory train.

Creepin', creepin', creepin', creepin'...
