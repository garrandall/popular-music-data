Oh ohh ohhh
Oh ohh ohhh
Started out talking right here
Puttin it down like a motherfuckin mack
Sellin me candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the d's on the lac
Slow dancin in the club
The diamonds look like rainbows
Shes grinding on my dick
She lookin for the pot of gold
We hop up in that amg and d we in the westin
She put the moves on me
I couldve sworn shawtys a wrestler

Everytime she leave the crib shawty be comin right back
She talkin dirty all up in my ear
And im fina put this dog right on the kitty cat

Callin last night flute
Actin like she didnt remember
I hopped up out dat linen im fina defend my title
Imma put ur ass to be tell me which way would u like it
