I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn and I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake 'em, it's nothin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too


'Cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could be mine, aw


Now, holidays come and then they go, it's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night, don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again


'Cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could be mine


You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine
You've gone sketching too many times
Oh, why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?




Well, you're breakin' down my back and I've been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until mornin', but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
'Cause this couch-trip's gettin' older, tell me how long has it been?
'Cause five years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet


Oh, you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could, you should be


You could be mine
Oh, you could be mine
You could be mine
Aw, you could be mine
You could be mine


Aw, You could be mine
Aw, You could be mine
Aw, You could be mine
You could be mine, yeah
