Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone

Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone
