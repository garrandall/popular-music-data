I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
But
I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love, it's (well, well)
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough (ah, yeah yeah)
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough


Oh oh, babe
Oh babe


My darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe


Oh, some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe
Tell me
What can I say?
What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?


Girl, all I know
Is every time you're here
I feel the change, huh
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'


Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe


Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe
How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much
Girl, you're so unreal, still
I keep loving you
More and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do
Because you're blowin' my mind


I get the same old feelin'
Every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'


Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe


Baby, it didn't take
All of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life
To keep you
Ohh, oh babe
Eh


My darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe


Oh my darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Woo
Darling, I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
