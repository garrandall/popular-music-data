A child asks his mother, do you love me
And it really means, will you protect me
His mother answers him, I love you
And it really means, you've been a good boy

And as the years go by
True love will never die

At seventeen a girl says, do you love me
And it really means, will you respect me
The teenage boy answers, I love you
But it really means, can I make love to you

And as the years go by
True love will never die

I will love you forever
I will love you forever

At sixty-five his wife says, do you love me
And it means, I'd like to hear it again
Her husband says to her, I love you
But it really means, I love you till the end

And as the years go by
True love will never die

Now you're asking me if I love you
And it really means will I marry you
And I answer, yes I love you
But it really means that I won't be untrue

And as the years go by
True love will never die

I will love you forever
I will love you forever
