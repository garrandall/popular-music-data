If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know…ho


You got a brother like me, the Gangsta D
I got a nice piece of meat that'll fit you to the tee
So come with me and I'll let you see
Soon as you pull down your panties I’m gonna brush on some coochie
Don't forget about K, just want me a fresh hoe
If you wanna trip let me know
Ain't got no time for no hoochie games
Just jump out the panties, don't feel no shame
I just love me some hoes, you know
I got these young girls fiendin’ for this fishing pole
And when I stick it to you, girl, you'll be happy
I'ma work it ‘til I sweat your fly ‘do nappy
Oh that look good, so good and so tight
Come on, girl, let me rip tonight
‘Cause if you do, I think I just might…ah, you know


If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know…ho


Yo, it ain't the length or the width, it's the way I work it
And like D said, girl, I'ma jerk, jerk, jerk it
Make you good 'til you curl up your toes
Knock the rollers out your hair 'til they fall on the floor
I was built for war not peace
And what I mean by war means tearing some sheets
And some spreads in the bed
I'll knock headboards until your clear stuff turns red
I'll make you flip, have a fit, while I’m making you moan and kick
Looka here, trick
Now I'm holding genuine beef, but you don't need teeth
All you need is strong knees


Now come on, lay down
Your butt is nice and round
Now don't interrupt
Because it's time to…


If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know…ho




It ain't nothing but meat on the bone
You can stroke it or choke it or leave it alone
Ain't nothing wrong with group sessions
Yeah, baby, you know, sexing
Just the daily average routine
Step up, baby, and get tag teamed
Young hoochies, we love coochies
If we want it, let us up on it


If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know
If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know
If you want it, then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
‘Cause there's something I should let you know
If you want it
