Where did you go, when things went wrong, baby
Who did u run to; find a shoulder to lay your head upon
Ooh wasn't I there, didn't I take good care of you
Oh no can't believe, your leaving me

Stay, Stay With Me Baby,
Stay With Me Baby,
Please Stay With Me Babe,
I can't go on

Where did you go, in search of tenderness?
Didn't I give you everything in return for a memory?
Ooh wasn't I there, baby I, maybe I was too good for you
Oh no can't believe, your leaving me

Stay, Stay With Me Baby,
Stay With Me Baby,
Please Stay With Me Babe,
I can't go on

Oh remember, you said you'd never leave me
Oh remember, you said you would always need me
Remember, Remember
I'm asking you, begging you, begging you

Ooh Stay with Me Babe,
Please Stay With Me Baby,
Oh please stay with me babe
I just can't go on
No stay, stay
I'll stay, stay, so don't go
Stay with me babe
You know I Can't go on, can't go on
Can't so, can't so stay please, stay
