One, two, three, four
Hey, hey (Forever)
Hey, hey (Forever)


It's you and me, moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you (Oh-oh)
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there (Oh)
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere (Yeah)
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me


It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (Oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor


Feels like we're on another level, oh
Feels like our love's intertwined
We can be two rebels
Breaking the rules, me and you, you and I
All you gotta do is watch me (Watch me)
Look what I can do with my feet (My feet)
Baby, feel the beat inside
I'm driving, you can take the front seat (Front seat)
I just need you to trust me (Trust me)
Oh (Girl), oh (Girl), oh (Girl)
It's like I've...


It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh, one night)
Double your pleasure, double your fun (Yeah)
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor


It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, "What a beautiful lady"
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (Fall, girl), let you fall, girl, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah


It's like...
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh, whole life) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Me, you and the dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor


Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Forever, ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
