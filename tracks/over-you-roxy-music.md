Oh baby this is nowhere
Wish I was somewhere - over you
Your sweet lips tell me there's no chance
No more romance - over you
Oh baby how can I go on?
Crying so long - over you
Where strangers look for new love
I'm so lost in love - over you
Some day yes it might come babe
When I'll be babe - over you
And always up to that moment
I will try to say I'm - over you
