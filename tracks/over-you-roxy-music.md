Oh baby
This is nowhere
Wish I was somewhere
Over you

Your sweet lips
Tell me there's no chance
No more romance
Over you

Oh baby
How can I go on
Crying so long
Over you

We're strangers
Lookin' for a new love
I'm so lost in love
Over you

Some day
Yes it might come, babe
When I'll be, babe
Over you

And always
Up to that moment
I will try to say
"I'm over you"
