If I told a lie
If I made you cry
When I said goodbye
I'm sorry

From the bottom of, of my heart
I apologize

If I caused you pain
I know I'm to blame
I must have been insane
Come on, forgive me

From the bottom of my broken heart
I apologize

I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make, make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than just friends

Now, if I made you blue
I've had some heartaches too
I beg of you
Come on, forgive me

From the bottom of, of my heart right now
I have got to apologize

Oh, Oh
I'm sorry
Oh, Oh
I'm sorry Dear
