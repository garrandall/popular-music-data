Well I met a little babe an hour ago
Wonder which way, which way the wind blow, yeah
 a Hollywood bungalow
I was rockin' little lady In the city of light


Yeah, I'm just another lost angel, woo
In the city of night (Ow!)
City of night
City of night
Woah, yeah
L.A. woman
L.A. woman
I said L.A. woman
L.A. woman
L.A. woman Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman Sunday afternoon


Drive through your suburbs
Into your blues
Into your blues, yeah
Into your blue, blue, blues
Into your blues
Oh, yeah


I see your hair is burning, aw
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
Well you know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
 roam, baby
I seen it
Cops in cars, topless bars
Never saw a woman, ha ha qoo
So alone
So alone
Said so alone
Oh yeah
Whoa

Wine spo-dee-o-dee
She drink my wine spo-dee-o-dee okay
Ah wine spo-dee-o-dee
She drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee  all day
I took my motorbike out and went for a ride
Slit the throat of the first babe who lied
See it it's twice his size oh
Wine spo-dee-o-dee all right
Wine spo-dee-o-dee all day
Wine spo-dee-o-dee
Well she drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee
It's good for her body
Wine spo-dee-o-dee


Another lost angel (Angel angel)
In the city of night
City of night
City of night
City of light
Whoa, yeah
Yeah

I said you're my woman
And that's right

And I'm right
I said L.A. woman
