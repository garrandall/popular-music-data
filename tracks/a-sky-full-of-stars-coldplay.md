Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
Wish that they would disappear
So we could get down now

Well I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, baby
Won't you pull me close
And take a step into no-man's land

Into a sky full of stars
I wanna give you my heart
Go on and tear me apart
Well I don't care if you do
As long as I'm with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love at a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can figure it out and I can hope and pray
Told him my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
Babe, where you're from, I don't think I've seen ya
I already know he's a keeper
The smile's making me a believer
From this one small act of kindness I'm in
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-deep, yeah

Cause in a sky full of stars
You know you're lighter the more it gets dark
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you, ohhhh you oh
I think I see you
I think I see you
