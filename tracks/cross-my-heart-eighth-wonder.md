Hypnotized
With just one look at you
I'm paralyzed
I can't explain
Why just one touch from you
Drives me insane

You've got me head over heels
Better believe it baby
And I love how it feels

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true

Believe me

Heavenly
Something happens
When you're next to me
I get chills
You can ask me anything
And babe I will

You've got me out of control
Better believe it baby
Form my head to my toes

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true

You're my valentine
Every month of the year
Baby rain or shine
I'm so happy when you're here
I want you all the time
Am I making myself clear?
My love's gonna last forever
Cross my heart

Cross my heart

I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you
