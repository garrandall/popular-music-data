Hey, there’s more to me than meets the eye

He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body

No, no

Oh, oh ooh

I was looking for much more
Than just another one night stand
Hoping to connect a little deeper
In a crowded room of cheap perfum
My eyes received his glance
Captured by the presence of this creature

Then we started to dance
I thought it was my chance
To display my inner message through the rhythm
I was mesmerized and tantalized
He told me with a smile
“Come on over
Get into my system”

Then we talk
And then he’s into love
No more conversation
Give it up, ow

He wants my body
He don’t care what’s on my mind, oh
He wants my body
My baby wants to horizontalize

He wants my body
(Oh)
He wants my body
He don’t care about my mind, no
He wants my body
(Oh)
He wants my body
He just wants to horizontalize

Then we talk about our future
Got to be friends soon
But he wants to keep his distance in the daylight
I dial his number
But he lets it ring
Don’t say a word
Just excuses everything, ow

He wants my body
He don’t care what’s on my mind, oh, oh
He wants my body
My baby wants to horizontalize, yeah, yeah, oh

He wants my body
He don’t care about on my mind, oh
He wants my body
His passion doesn’t waste no time
Oh, no, no, no

(Oh, sugar)
(Oh, sugar)
(I really, really love you)
Uh-uh
(Uh-uh, what’s the matter, baby?)
Don’t even try it

I dial his number
He lets it ring
Don’t say a word
Just excuses everything, yeah

He wants my body
He don’t care what’s on my mind
He wants my body
My baby wants to horizontalize, yeah

He wants my body
(He wants your body)
He don’t care about on my mind, no, no
He wants my body
(He wants your body)
His passion doesn’t waste no time

He wants my body (oh
He wants my body
He don’t care about my mind, no
He wants my body (oh
He wants my body
He just wants to horizontalize

He wants my body, oh

He don’t care what’s on my mind, yeah
He wants my body
(He wants your body)
Hey, there’s more to me than meets the eyes

He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
