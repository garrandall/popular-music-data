Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all the kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening to hymns of offering?
Have we eyes to see that love is gathering?
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding into one

So I walk up on high and I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself while the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh, it's the world I know
I know, the world I know
