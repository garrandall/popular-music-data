Are you ready?
Woo

Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo

Free

Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo

Free, baby
Mmm


Boy
When you look at me
Do you judge me by my cover?
Got to be kidding me
To think that I'm that kind of lover

I don't mean to disagree
Sorry you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes
And see
True love comes for free

I'm keeping my heart open
Hoping you won't stab me in it
Cause I've been in love before

When I had to pay
I didn't
I lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me
How much will it be?

No more than I'm willing to give
(Yeah, yeah)
Cause you won't pay nothing
For this good loving
(All right)
It's for free

And I won't make you promises
(Uh-uh)
I'll just do all I can
To be your lover cause I understand


The best things in life are free
(Yeah)
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me

The best things
(Yeah)
In life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
(Come on now)
Ah, ha, ha
Hey, yeah, yeah

Ooh
I like that (Hey)
Now, Janet
(Mmm, Luther)


I know you are my baby
My one and only baby
You said it twice
I'll say it thrice
My baby, baby, baby

I've got so much love for you
(Yeah, yeah)
And it's easy to give it
When I know you feel
(Yeah, yeah)
The same way too

That's all I expect from you
Just be all that you can
To be my lover
Cause I understand
I do, I do
They say
(Hoo, hoo)


The best things
(Yeah)
In life are free
(Yeah)
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
(I discovered)

The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me

The best things in life are free
(So free, I'm free, so glad I'm free)
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

(BBD, tell 'em 'bout feel)


Sister, sister
Kicking all that jazz
(Yeah)
Cause money, honey
Want what you never had
(Yeah)

A lot of bone structure
I could make it last
I'm in it to win it
RD, feel the past

Yeah
Material, imperial
So get the info
You know I know
It's not about the dough
So baby, baby
If you wanna be my lady
I'll forget the riches and the other itches

Mo' money, mo' money
(Jam and Lewis, here we go)
Mo' money, mo' money
(Luther, Janet, here we go)
Mo' money, mo' money
(Biv, DeVoe, here we go)
Mo' money, mo' money
(Ralph T, speak)
The best things in life are for free

Mmm, hmm

Free, baby
(Yeah)

No more than I'm willing to give
(Willing to give)
'Cause you won't give me nothing
For that good loving
It's for free

And I won't make you promises
(Ooh)
You see
I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be
We're gonna be

I'm gonna be the very best I can
To be your lover
Cause I understand
(Ooh)

It feels good
Feels good
Feels good
Feels so good

Uh, hold it, hold it
Wait a minute
I still don't think they got it

Let's tell 'em one more time
Check it out
Everybody needs to know that

The best things
(Yeah)
In life are free
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
(Oh, everybody knows that)

The best things
(That's right)
In life are free
(Yeah)

Now that we've got each other
(Each other)
The best things in life are free
(Don't you know, don't know?)

The best things in life are free
(The best things in life are free, don't you know?)
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
(What you mean to me)

The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

Don't you know?
Don't you know?
The very best in life is free
And I'm free
Yeah
