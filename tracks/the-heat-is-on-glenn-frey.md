The heat is on, on the street
Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on
Oh it's on the street
The heat is... on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on (oh yeah)
The heat is on (burnin' burnin' burnin')
Oh it's on the street
The heat is... on

The shadows are on the darker side
Behind those doors, it's a wilder ride
You can make a break, you can win or lose
That's a chance you take, when the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on (oh yeah)
The heat is on (burnin' burnin' burnin')
It's on the street (woo-hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)
The heat is on (Baby can't you feel it?)
Yeah it's on the street (woo-hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)
(Fade Out)
