Once I had a pretty girl
Her name it doesn't matter
She went away with an other guy
And now he won't even look at her

Hats off to Larry
He broke your heart
Just like you broke mine when you
Said we must part
He told you lies
Now its your turn to cry, cry, cry
Now that Larry said good bye to you

I know this may sound strange
I want you back I think you'll change
But there's one more thing I gotta say

Hats off to Larry
It may sound cruel
But you laughed at me when you said we were through
You told me lies
Now its your turn to cry, cry, cry
Now that Larry said good bye to you

Hats off to Larry
It may sound cruel
But you laughed at me when you said we were through
You told me lies
Now its your turn to cry, cry, cry
Now that Larry said good bye to you

Good Bye to you
Good Bye to you
Hats Off To Larry

Hats off Larry!

Yeah!
Wooh!
Yeah!
Yeah!
