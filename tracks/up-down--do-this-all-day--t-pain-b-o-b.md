Uh
Uh
Uh (Mustard on the beat, hoe)


I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (know it)
Til they call you to the stage (stage)
Then you seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (Throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going up, down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Tryna see wassup now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'


Black card, party in the back yard
Shorty got the black bra showing (black bra showing)
Tatted up, ass fat enough
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, yeah yeah she know it
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, yeah yeah she know it
She gon' make me spend some money on it
Whole bank account and I'll blow it


Go do a show then, bring some mo' in
Pockets bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then slow-motion
I'm so gone off Patron
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like


I ain't even know it, even know it
Till they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'


Shorty thick , thicker than a snicker
Every time she do it it's for me and my niggas
And her friend do it with her
She don't even like girls
But a stack will make her kiss her (go on, kiss her)
Go on kiss her, go on, go on Kiss her (go on Kiss her)
She don't even like girls
But a stack will make her kiss her (go on, kiss her)
Go on, kiss her, go on, go on, kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
She keep fucking around I'll launch this missile
She make it drop then jiggle


Go do a show then, bring some mo' in
Booty bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then slow-motion
I'm so gone off Patron
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like


I ain't even know it, even know it
Till they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'


And you know it, look at how she throw it
If it get any bigger baby girl gon' have to tow it
Sitting on them M's like Floyd
But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as Iâ€™m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know


I ain't even know it, even know it
Till they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'
I ain't even know it, even know it
Till they call you to the stage
Then you seen a nigga throw it, th- throw it
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin'
