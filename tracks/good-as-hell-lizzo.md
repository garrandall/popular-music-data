I do my hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell

Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going to the pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Feeling good as hell
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell

Woo girl, need to kick off your shoes
Got to take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Show it off tonight
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
And we gon' be alright
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby, how you feeling?
(Feeling good as hell)

Mmm, yeah
Alright, listen

If he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
Show it off tonight
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
And we gon' make it right
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby, how you feeling?

(Feeling good as hell)
Feeling good as hell
Baby how you feelin'?
Feeling good as hell
