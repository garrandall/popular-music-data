Johnny joined the Navy
Now he's far at sea
And when he departed
He said this to me

Darling I'll be faithful
Darling I'll be true
Every night at seven
I'll be kissing you

Johnny's two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away
Two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away
But I pretend that he's in my arms
At seven o'clock every day
Though he's two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away

Maybe I look silly
I don't really care
I'll keep kissing Johnny
Though he isn't there

'Cause he made a promise
When he went away
We would kiss each other
At seven every day

Johnny's two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away
Two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away
But I pretend that he's in my arms
At seven o'clock every day
Though he's two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles
Two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles
Two thousand, two hundred, twenty three miles away
