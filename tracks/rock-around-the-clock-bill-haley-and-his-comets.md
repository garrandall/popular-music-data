One, Two, Three O'clock, Four O'clock rock
Five, Six, Seven O'clock, Eight O'clock rock
Nine, Ten, Eleven O'clock, Twelve O'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight


Put your glad rags on and join me hon'
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one


We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight


When the clock strikes two, three and four
If the band slows down we'll yell for more


We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight


When the chimes ring five, six and seven
We'll be right in seventh heaven


We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight


When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too
I'll be goin' strong and so will you


We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight


When the clock strikes twelve we'll cool off then
Start rockin' around the clock again


We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'till broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight
