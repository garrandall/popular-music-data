When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone

Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
And how many fools would have you
I know one

This fool keeps wondering why
He fell in love at all
But you might need this fool
Around in case you fall

After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you
I know one

You never know you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep
An extra fool on your list

After your heart's been broken
And you need a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you
I know one. (yes)

I know one. (umm hum)
I know one...
