I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn't scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It's a good night good night baby goodnight

You couldn't see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn't go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall

So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It's a good night good night baby goodnight

I turned off the car
ran through the yard
back to your front door
Half scared to death can't catch my breath
Aren't these the moments we live for

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It's a good night good night baby goodnight
It's a good night good night baby goodnight
It's a good night good night baby goodnight
It's a good night good night baby goodnight
