Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me

Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
What you're thinking of me

I can see it
Face is glowing
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it


That you're having my baby


You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doing to ya


Having my baby


You're a woman in love
And I love what's going through ya

The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya

Baby, do you feel it growing
Are you happy you know it
That you're


Having my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me


Having my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me


Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put ya through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it


And you're having my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me


Having my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me


Having my baby
(Having my baby)
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me


Having my baby
(having my baby)


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me
