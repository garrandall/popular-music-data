I am confident but
I still have my moments.
Baby, that's just me.

I'm not a supermodel,
 I still eat McDonald's.
 I still eat at Ronald's.
Baby, that's just me.

Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same
In the la-la land machine, machine.

Who said I can't wear my converse with my dress?
Well, baby, that's just me!

And who said I can't be single
And have to go out and mingle
Baby, that's not me, no, no.

Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the la-la land.

Tell me do you feel the way I feel
'Cause nothing else is real
In the la-la land appeal



Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything
Because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the la-la land machine

Well, I'm not gonna change
In the la-la land machine
I will stay the same
In the la-la land...

Machine
Machine
Machine

I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)

La la la la la
