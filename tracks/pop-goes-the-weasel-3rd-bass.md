Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?

Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!


Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill


I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change


Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Vic the music and make senseless ryhmes fit


I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read


So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)


Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop


Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure


Why score all my points in one period
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel


Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop

 Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
 But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid


Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours


Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and I'mma nut like a SCUD see
Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels


Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop

Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
