Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


Startin' blazin', and star gazin'
And see how you can reach your farthest aspiration
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a 47 with' a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try hide divine intention
It's like, let 'em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life hands you lemons it's time to eliminate
More aside with' a lemonade anyways
Different days different highs different haze
Kama Sutra with' miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her she a vibrant thang


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Cause I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


You niggas is suspect and I'm just a roughneck
That wasn't breakin' pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she gettin' rough sex no Sunset
I like a chick with' a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
I keep my eye they sus' too
Never tell 'em our goverment
Make any covenants
Bitches be lovin' it
See not to put a glove on it
Funny shit, you must've thought
I was a dumby miss
I feed lies to felines
Just to get up any time he's quick
Ye you got tricks but I got 5 more
So any game you trying to play you better
Know, I got the high score
You better settle down 'cause you not on my level now
The pro's is in my circle
They could tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns what this shit about
They used to doubt now they see 'em sprout
And I'm out


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Nigga I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


When I was 13 I was bad
Rapping 'bout guns we never had
Now we smoke holes are float to tips
Old homies talking shit
Say you got what's best of mom
You stay platinum on that dime
Thought we was cool before
And we gonna take your ass on tour
Fuck nah, this much as to get
How you entitled to my shine
Nigga you ain't helped me get it
Now these niggas seen me gettin' it
Checking the statements from my debit
My profile get requested
But I never hit accept
Hits the sigh on to the chest
I reflect
When I was 14 our blazed eyes
Glued to the sampless screen
Eyes beam, 'cause we can make it better
Smoking on that jack era
Welcome to the progressive era


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Cause I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter


But tell me what really matters
When you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit
Don't come on silver platter
So I gather my thoughts
And made use of all these synonyms
'Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon excuse me if I'm militant
The cinnamon in my hood could leave a nigga
Quivering like God damn the living
And the venom in his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a stand still
So tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart
Still seem to be simmering
I'll take that little simmer and
Turn to an adrenaline
Penicillin cannot stop the drive
He be giving 'em like
Mad fords for fast forward
Let's get to the part
Where his records could afford
Him a couple of fords
Like Lord
Any gift at christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday
And by the way
I'm possibly on monopoly
And own all Donalds property
'Cause I won't live in poverty
Like


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


In the clouds come and find me
So I'm flying to Hermione
Homie tripping got 'em soundin' like
Hanson in the '90's
Charlie Manson, yo her body
'Cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out
So get your wish and count
You sell me something
Then I flip that amount
I just switched that account
Get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder
But it's Nyck bitch no doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm vibin', ring the siren
With these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no licence
Hard, man I'm feeling like a Spartan
With a trident down
Picture perfect
But I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot
No Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one
Catch a fair smack
I hunt upon my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today
Like be afraid


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Cause I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


Cool cuts flow
The deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes
Choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke
But I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know
Oh, suckers fuck around
Get clap before you risk that
Nigga sayin' you crackin'
Fabric of your imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find
Sex in these verses
But I got your attention
It's part of my ascension
But if I keep totin'
This chant is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, but to mention
Niggas is snitchin', might charge me with battery
But fuck that 'cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to line a nigga
That got mine on my third eye shit


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Say I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


Man I'm on a higher degrees
Without my masters
I could use my word
To urge in a disasters
Niggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning
And they see we getting love
'Cause they see the pros is winning
'Cause we giving love back
So they peeping how we fittin'
And gonna have to tuss nigga step into me
I like to keep my chakras open
So respect my G
I got the bush going in
Rapping FPT
So sus' niggas watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what they mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wave pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene
I'm taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


The P the R the O the Debt
Never in my vex
I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect
I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me
I deck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check
Made you making all the wrong moves
Why intimidate you, I more infuriate you
'Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and tell me what you peepin'
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seein'
It is what here sits in the midst of us
Yea quite mysterious, no you're not delirious
I'm serious, it's clear to us
Add some crystal gonna see gold than platinum
Set it on the tarots before
So I know how it is all
Gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown
More on the cloud
'Cause didn't you know by now
I'm skyline bound
And my time's now
I don't graze ground
I'm new in your town
So assume what you please
But you don't know me
Say what you please
But you don't know Tina


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


Who that mofo that came to show boat
It's 'cause he flow like no other
Styles mood his brother
And slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on track ain't a real test
The real quest, is making real tracks
With feelings people ain't feel yet
Deadly be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records
I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking
For beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line up
The bars that I could line up
Could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge
Rap is in my blood so much
My capillaries adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January
Every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times
Than my school's lunch line
So if this hit's mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty da' vocals recorded spit shine


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 And I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit


'Til the day I die
I'll be puffin' la
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell 'em government spies
I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move
'Cause I done move like a coward
Knowledge is power
And the flower of life is ours
Get his eyes hours
Maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind
And maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential
In our body and soul
Prolly you know
I found mines right through the pencil
Started body and flow
But fuck that
There's been a preview of primeval
Hip hop retrieval, I hold it legal
Like I'm coppers so weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top
No redo, thinking up evil but see no evil
Just because
'Cause I didn't ask to be this good
They just made me better
They told me cheese at the camps
And they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three bass, 2 Pac
But he only made one 'era
The era


Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
 Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit
