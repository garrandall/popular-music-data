Yes, it's over, call it a day
Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end some day, this way


Guess it's over, the kids are gone
What's the use of tryin' to hang on
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me and it's clear to see


Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late to try again with you
We're in the middle of ending something that we knew

 It's over

 Oh, it was over


Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

 Ah, it's over

 It's over


Guess it's over, the chips are down (whoa)
Nearly all our bridges tumbled down


Whatever chance we try, let's face it why deny
It's over (It's over)
It's over


Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

 And it's over

 And it's over

 And it's over


Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
