Hey girl; you're coming with me - your coming with me
Hey girl; you're coming with me - your coming with me
Hey girl; you're coming with me - your coming with me
Hey girl; you're coming... c'mon

Talk to me, girl,
Let me tell you, girl.
Got you stuck on my elevator.
Get it up.
On my eh o eh oh.


Hey
My first flow stuck on a gold-digging woman
Money cash flow all big-faced honeys
Frontin' on the floor got them d-boys running
Shorty got both broke can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana and she get up on my money
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See the karats on her wrist now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye now she want me
And while I got the juice wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A


Got you stuck on my elevator
Get it up on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know 'cause...

This girl is... she's stuck on my ellaâe-ella-vator (frikki frikki) 

This girl is... she's stuck on my...


She got a nail kit, she got a hair kit
She got a Gucci bag, her brand new outfit
Stuck on my elevator, she on the second floor
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some more
Hey, dime piece girl turned to Internet hottie
Little mama got that top-model body
South Beach peach go in the back of that Ducati
I'll bet you that brand new Ferrari


Got you stuck on my
On my elevator
Get it up, on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know, 'cause...

This girl is... she's stuck on my ellaâe-ella-vator (frikki frikki) 

This girl is... she's stuck on my...


Hey
My third floor stuck on the hood rat charm
Cut, tanktop, Hollyhood act charm
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bump the "Low" ringtone
Bend the ghetto booty, bend the ghetto booty on her
Roll up and hit it, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off 10 grand.
Project all the way gotta all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake she'll put it in your face
Three stories while them hood rats beg


Got you stuck on my on my elevator
get it up on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know, 'cause...

This girl is... she's stuck on my ellaâe-ella-vator (frikki frikki) 

This girl is... she's stuck on my...
