I went up to the mountain
Because you asked me to
Up over the clouds
To where the sky was blue

I could see all around me
Everywhere
I could see all around me
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
I've never been nothing but tired
And I'll be walking
Till the day I expire

Sometimes I lay down
Nothing more can I do
Then I go on again
'Cause you ask me to

Some days I look down
I'm so afraid I will fall
And although the sun shines
I see nothing at all
Then I hear your sweet voice
Come and then go, come and then go
Telling me softly
You love me so

The peaceful valley
Just over the mountain
The peaceful valley
That so few comes to know
I may never get there
Ever in this lifetime
But sooner or later
It's there I will go
Sooner or later
It's there I will go
