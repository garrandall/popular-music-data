Taking a trip up to Abergavenny
Hoping the weather is fine
If you should see a red dog running free
Well, you know he's mine

Ah, chasing the hills up to Abergavenny
I've got to get there and fast
If you can't go, then I'll promise to
Show you a photograph

Ah, passing the time with paradise people
Paradise people, fine by me
Sunshine forever, lovely weather
Don't you wish you could be

Taking a trip up to Abergavenny
Hoping the weather is fine
If you should see a red dog running free
Well, you know he's mine

Ah, passing the time with paradise people
Paradise people, fine by me
Sunshine forever, lovely weather
Don't you wish you could be

Ah, chasing the hills up to Abergavenny
I've got to get there and fast
If you can't go, then I'll promise to
Show you a photograph
A little photograph
A little photograph
Up to Abergavenny

Oh, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
