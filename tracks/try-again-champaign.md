I been starin' at your photograph
Wondering where you're at today
And I've been hanging by the telephone
Hopin' that you'd call home and stay

You told me you needed
More walks, more talks
More feelin' close to me
I wanna be close to you

I didn't know you needed
Some roses, some romance
A little candlelight and slow dance
That's not how it's been
But maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again

I remember all the days gone by
And I'm wonderin' why I couldn't see
I could search the whole world over
And never find what you were always giving me

I told you I needed
More time, more space, more freedom
(Free to do) free to do, girl
What you wanna do

I gave you no roses, no romance
No candlelight and no slow dance
But that's just how it's been
Maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again, yeah



Oh, I remember when
You told me you needed
More walks, more talks
More feelin' close to me
I wanna be close to you, yeah

I'll give you some roses
Whole lot of romance
A little candlelight (slow dance)
Don't let this feeling end
Maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again

Maybe we can try again
We can try again
Maybe we can try again
Maybe we can try again
