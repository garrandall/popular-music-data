Lookin' both ways again
I ain't trying to pretend
Bring it up, break it in
Break it down that's a win
Ya, ya, ya, I got a way
Ya, I got a way
Hold up, I'm on a way
Play, play, play, hold up

We came to play, we came to play
I'm on a way
We can't even stay
I'm on a way
This ain't a game
I brought my team on, let's get it
They see the team strong, we in it
I feel like King Kong in the building
I used to play games now we winning

Laugh and joke but I don't play (I don't)
Family broke that's not a game (no)
Me and Keenan bought to change (cut it)
So I'm not at the end of my strike
Maintain, that's the way I was raised
Crae came told me stay in the race
Fake friends told me to stay in my place
Champaign while we raising the stakes
I'm from the dirt they can't bury us
That was no choice but to step it up
Everything just to get at ya
Nothing about me is regular, ya
You know we live it man, we ain't never show
You know we winning man on the low
You boast on anything check the score
Same thang as before (what?)
I caught a wave though, can't even swim
Walk of fame, sittin' pretty
I was there, take the drug
Make a noise
Take the feelin', feelin' like I'm new
Nothin' happen cause we movin' through
Hit the field, time to show them proof
Win the game, that just what we do
We do

We came to play, we came to play
I'm on a way
We came to stay
I'm on a way, yah (I'm on the way)
This ain't a game
I brought my team on, let's get it
They see the team strong, we in it
I feel like King Kong in the building
I used to play games now we winning
We came to play, we came to play
Yeah, I'm on a way
We can't even stay
I'm on a way, yah (I'm on the way)
This ain't a game
I brought my team on, let's get it
They see the team strong, we in it
I feel like King Kong in the building
I used to play games now we winning
Canon!


Yah, this the hard work look at my hand
Hold up, I pull up with the team with the mini van
Ice cream man wanna slide through
But I ain't still cold, nothin wanna find you
I'm Marshawn Lynch in my interview
I'm bout to run through about ten of you (bruuupp)
This way, that way I finish you (pew)
Lord can't see how I get to You
They try to shut me down like I'm hogtied
Playin' for the wrong team cause you off sides
Different color whatchu want, whatchu call mine
I been to canon, I ain't trippin', got the carbine
If you got it, get the wonder in the vain flow
A mediator had to sit a bit between both
I shooting for the win like a free throw
Blow the whistle, got the charge call the R.I.C.O
Them haters they out in our range
Lebron when I'm smashin the paint
They cookin the Curry, I flame (ooh)
Tell them I'm harder than James
Champaign bottles poppin but we were not forgotten
God will not forsake us today
Yah, bout to go live for my glass
Ooh, T-Dot we raising the stakes


We came to play yeah, we came to play yeah
I'm on a way
We came to stay, hey!
I'm on a way, yah
This ain't a game
I brought my team on, let's get it
They see the team strong, we in it (we in it)
I feel like King Kong in the building
I used to play games now we winning
We came to play yeah, we came to play yeah
I'm on a way
We came to stay
I'm on a way, yah (I'm on the way)
This ain't a game
I brought my team on, let's get it
They see the team strong, we in it
I feel like King Kong in the building
I used to play games now we winning

I caught a way yeah, yah
I'm on the way yeah, yah
I ain't changed nothin'
I'm gonna stay yeah, yah
I'm on the way yeah, yah
Call the game, yah
Dogs off the leash
Yeah we off the chain, yah
Movin' with all that is everythin, yah
They can't beat my squad, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah
They can't hit this hard I'm sorry
They can't get this type of song beat
Yeah, yeah
They can't stop me now like smarty (no you can't)
Eat it down, and it's bout to go down
Say you don't even know
I could get it every time
Take it down to the floor yah
Tell em that it's goin down, yah
I'm on my way, yah
I'm on my way, yah
I'ma stay fleeking, yah
I came to play, yah
Get you the game, yah
Get you the game, yah
Bogus, bogus, bogus everywhere
God is good, ain't ever gettin scared
Ain't no lettin
