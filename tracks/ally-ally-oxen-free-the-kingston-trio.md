Time to let the rain fall without the help of man. Time to let the trees grow tall. Now, if they only can
Time to let our children live in a land that's free. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free

Time to blow the smoke away and look at the sky again. Time to let our friends know we'd like to begin again
Time to send a message across the land and sea. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free

Strong and weak, mild and meek, no more hide and seek
Time to see the fairness of a children's game. Time for men to stop and learn to do the same
Time to make our minds up if the world at last will be. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free
