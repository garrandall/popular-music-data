You know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
Comet, and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history"

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history"
