Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(Reindeer)
Had a very shiny nose
(Like a light bulb)
And if you ever saw it
(Saw it)
You would even say it glows
(Like a flash light)
All of the other reindeer
(Reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
(Like Pinocchio)
They never let poor Rudolph
(Rudolph)
Play in any reindeer games
(Like Monopoly)

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(Loved him)
And they shouted out with glee
(Yippee)
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(Reindeer)
You'll go down in history!"
(Like Columbus)

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(Loved him)
And they shouted out with glee
(Yippee)
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(Reindeer)
You'll go down in history!"
You'll go down in history!
