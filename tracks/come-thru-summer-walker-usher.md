(We got London on the track)

I shoulda known better
Can't even pretend like I don't want it again
On the brain all the time
Thinking of all the things that we did

You did something
'Cause shit like this don't happen too often
It's the way you put it down
I don't want no one else around
Got me takin' a step on the wild side
Cuttin' all ties with them other guys
Way you, way you, look in my eyes
Lovin' me nice and slow

You make me wanna come through
Quarter after 2, just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of those things that you and me went through
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after 2, just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of those things that you and me went through

Look at what you make me wanna do
I'll drop all my niggas for you
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop
This ain't what I'm really used to

Before anything happens between us
Be sure you ten toes down before I pull out this car
And the only thing that's coming beside me
Out this situation is you waiting to get some more
I told ya, I'ma take you places, I seen it in your face
And I knew that you would say this, so how you wanna play this?
Yeah, you got somebody, I been in this predicament
Don't trip, creep discrete, that's just what we dealin' with

Come through
Quarter after 2, just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of those things that you and me went through
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after 2, just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of those things that you and me went through

(You make wanna)
Look at what you make me wanna do
I'll drop all my niggas for you
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop
This ain't what I'm really used to
(You make wanna)

It ain't what you're used to
But you'll do
(You make wanna)

New relationship too, this is what ya do
Think about her, good Lord
