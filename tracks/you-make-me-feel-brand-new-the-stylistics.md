My love,
I'll never find the words my love, to tell you how I feel my love.
Mere words, could not explain.

Precious love,
You held my life within your hands, created everything I am,
Taught me how to live again.

Only you,
Came when I needed a friend, believed in me through thick and thin,
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you, you make me feel brand new,
For God bless me with you, you make me feel brand new,
I sing this song 'cause you, make me feel brand new.

My love,
When ever I was insecure, you built me up and made me sure,
You gave, my pride, back to me.

Precious friend,
With you I'll always have a friend, your someone who I can depend,
To walk a path that sometimes bends.

Without you,
Life has no meaning or rhyme, like notes to a song out of time,
How can I repay, you'll find heaven, faith and me

God bless you, you make me feel brand new,
For God bless me with you, you make me feel brand new
