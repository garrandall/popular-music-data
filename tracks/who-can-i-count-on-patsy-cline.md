Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
I never counted on 
You makin' me blue
They say you're a-runnin round 
With somebody new
Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?

I thought I held a precious key to heaven
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start
But now I feel that I can't go on living
If livin' means that we must live apart.

Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
There goes my happiness 
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself
That we're really through
Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?

The door to happiness was almost open
Just one more step or two and I'd be in
Then all at once, the vows you made were broken
The door to happiness was closed again.

Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
There goes my happiness 
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself 
That we're really through
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you?

Who can I count on?
Who can I count on?
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you?...
