Mornings alone
When you come home
I breathe a little faster

Every time we're together
It'd never be the same
If you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long?

Why can't we stay together?
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason.

'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you.
It's just another day

Making the time
Find the right lines
To make you stay forever

What do I have to tell you?
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Give us a chance to make it.

No, no, no
Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong
I'm not that strong.

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you, no

Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason.

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Baby no
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you.

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you.
