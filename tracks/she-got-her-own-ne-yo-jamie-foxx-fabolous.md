A dedication to the independent woman
to the one working hard for hers
that is just my way to let you know
I see you baby
And I brought a friend along 
to help me show my appreciation the right way
Ladies, Mr. Jamie Foxx
Mr, Jamie Foxx, Ladies


I love her cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy
Than a girl that want but don't need me
Young independent, yea she work hard
But you can tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays agressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin in her eyes
Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my world

Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it


I love it cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothin that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Lovely face
Nice thick thighs
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy Thang
She's mcfly
All the while payin' the bills on time
She don't look at me like Captain save 'em
Gold Diggin, no she don't do that
Now she lookin me like inspiration
She wanna be complimentin' my swag
And everything she got, she work for it, good life made for it
She take pride in sayin' that she paid for it

Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it
She say
Uh Uh, I got it, I got it, I got it


(Hey my shawty comin' round callin out I got it
she won't even let me put my hands in her pockets
gotta learn that though)

Don't make me laugh boo
Never did that bad too
Make you even have to
But even if I had to
Ask my better half to
You be more than glad to
When I do that math boo
You always try to add two
I need someone who'd ride for me
Not someone who'd ride for free
She said boy I don't just ride, She'll pull up beside of me
I had to ask her what she doin in that caddy
She said cause you my baby I'd be stuntin' like my daddy
And there's not many, who catch my eye
We both wearing gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I, Suppose to keep her closer
Right by the side, toast and to host her
And that she went low so, case you didn't know so
You can save your money dawg shawty getting dough so
What she care wit his cars, you can call her miss boss
I got it backwards, criss cross, shawty got her own


Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothin'
except some of that good lovin'
let me hear you say
uh uh uh uh
Now you fellas know you need you stop your frontin'
if you love an independent woman
let me hear you say
uh uh uh uh

Got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
Uh Uh, I got it, I got it, I got it
