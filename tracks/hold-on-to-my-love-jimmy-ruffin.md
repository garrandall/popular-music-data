Today you came by to tell me you are leaving me
And to say that the love
And all that we knew had just drifted away
And I look in your eyes
And I couldn't bear the pain I felt inside of my heart
To think that I'm gonna be lonely again
And if ever you go then I know at a glance
I don't stand a chance

Hold on to my love I'm nothing
And I can't get along without you
You're the light of my life
And no living without your love

It's so hard to believe that you're going away
Couldn't make me feel so down
'cause I know that from this moment on I won't have you around
And if ever you go then I know at a glance
That won't stand a chance

Hold on to my love I'm nothing
And I can't get along without you
You're the light of my life
And no living without your love

Oh oh baby
Nobody's taking your place
But for you , but for me
Our love would live on for the whole world to see

So hold on to my love , I'm nothing
And I can't get along without you
You're the light of my life
And no living without your love
