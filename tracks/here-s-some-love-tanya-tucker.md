I been watchin' you cryin' when you do, I just feel like dyin'
I could give you somethin' that would ease your mind, yeah
Let me give it to you just a little bit would do you
It's somethin' you been needin' for a long, long time

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you, save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you
It'll grow with you, some day you can bring it back to stay

Don't you keep me waiting now what's the use in hesitating?
You know as well as me, it's what you're looking for, yeah
Put your lips on mine now, now, now, we can make it feel so fine now
You never have to be without it any more

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you, save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you, baby
It'll grow with you, someday you can bring it back to stay

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you, save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you, oh yeah
It'll grow with you, someday
