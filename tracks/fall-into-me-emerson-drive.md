Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

You say you've turned it off 
Hid your heart up on a shelf 
Scared of what it might cost 
To take it down for someone else 
'Cause loving him you lost 
Too much of yourself 
Baby can't you see 
That he's
Not me

And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me 
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be 
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

I'll follow any road 
Anywhere to get to you 
I'll open up my soul 
If that's what you need me to do 
Now baby it's your move 
All you got to do is believe
In love 
Just believe
In us 

And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me 
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be 
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us

Baby I need you
To know you can
Fall into me 
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be 
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
Come and
Fall into me
Fall into me
(Fall into me)
