Cook that shit up Quay!


Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin bitch then I'm stabbin' ya friend
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again
Big ole forty on me, back packin' again
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)


Quavo
Back at it, back at it
Count up a hundred throw racks at it
Yeah my wrist a Titanic
Ice hit the glacier, it do damage (Ice)
Yeah your nigga gon' panic
I see through her panties like a panoramic (Hey)
Yeah now get back to whippin'
And get back to trappin' young nigga back at it
If it's too crowded might out the roof
And say let them come through
Keep it one thousand when I'm in the booth
I spent two thousand to step in the shoes
Gang on gang how you think we gon' lose
Back to back motorcade, that how we move
On momma porch was sittin' on the stoop (Momma)
When I hopped up I took off to the Moon (Ooh)


Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin bitch then I'm stabbin' ya friend
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again
Big ole forty on me, back packin' again
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)

My diamonds like Fiji, bitch, I'm Yella Beezy
Iced-out in this freezer, just copped a Luigi
Oh take it easy, you trippin' I'm leavin'
My drank in the freezer, this shit don't come easy
I'm trappin' I mean it, my blood double G me
The Cougar the heater, take la seÃ±orita ?
I'll send some shots through a nigga wife-beater
Chopper knock a nigga out on his people
Don't call me, lil baby, I'm sorry don't need ya
Last month I got shot up, I been win up on features
Body for body my niggas some demons
We tit for tat, leave you busted and bleedin'
Stop in Atlanta in the booth with my Nina
Back in the day used to trap in a Beamer
I'm a true hustler my bitch is a schemer
Skeet in her eyes and that lil bitch a creamer (Ay)

Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin bitch then I'm stabbin' ya friend
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again
Big ole forty on me, back packin' again
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)


Wrist so froze, can't shake hands, I gotta give you a pound
Way my bank account quadrupled, think I'm still slingin' pounds (Wow)
Told them castin' my vote for who tryna get this dope cross the border
Grew up from East Atlanta, but stand my ground like it's Florida
Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff, fuck the local reporter
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer, Guwop slicker than oil
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith to the trap with the Adler
Look like a Rolls Royce dealership, every time I bring out my cars
Fuck the stars, buy the bar, neighborhood superstar (S'Gucci)
Twenty-four K, Bruno Mars, down to the drawers (Guwop)
I'm thinking' large, talkin' old money, Chico DeBarge
Lou say I'm 20 futuristic movin' this part (S'Gucci)


Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin bitch then I'm stabbin' ya friend
I'm in the hood they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Oh my gosh back at it again (Back at it)
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again
Big ole forty on me, back packin' again
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)
