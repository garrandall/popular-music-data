Same time, same same
Kissing at the same
Same time, two bitches at the same time


Red bottom bitch
Baby poppin' shit
They know that I'm rich
I'm tryna fuck the clique
Girl don't play no games
You know just what you came to
Heard they with this shit
So fuck it, let me bring my main too


She don't play no games, no she don't BS
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, (yeah) pull up at the same time
I'ma need both of you to pull up at the same time
Ain't no rules, I need two, double trouble
Tongue kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love love love love it (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love love love love it
Yeah this a double date night
She love love love love it, yeah (woo)
Kissing at the same time
The same time, two bitches at the same time


I can't do just uno, I need least a duo
Tell your friend to bring two friends
And tell her bring bout' two more
I'ma beat the shit up like judo
I'ma dog with the pussy like kujo
She said she was squating
Ol' girl got that ass on sumo
I'm on a pill right now, wanna see you start across her face
That's how I feel right now, kissing and tell me how it taste
Let's keep it trill right now
I'm tryna fuck 'cause I called up her
I need a plus, one ain't enough, woo


She don't play no games, no she don't BS
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, (yeah) pull up at the same imt
I'ma need both of you to pull up at the same time
Ain't no rules, I need two, double trouble
Tongue kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love love love love it (ooh)
Kissing at the same time
Yeah, she love love love love it
Yeah this a double date night
She love love love love it, yeah (woo)
Kissing at the same time
The same time, two bitches at the same time

Ring, ring, she calling me, you know I pick up
Baby, got two phones, that's the hotline, yeah
Said she with her friends and her friends down to play too
Uber on the way, about 9

She don't play no games, no she don't BS
Ain't gotta be my main, said she coming with her friends
Said they both gon' drop it, ooh yeah, on the chandelier
This what happen when a nigga keep it real
I told them both the truth, (yeah) pull up at the same imt
I'ma need both of you to pull up at the same time
Ain't no rules, I need two, double trouble
Tongue kissing at the same time

Yeah this a double date night
She love love love love it, yeah (woo)
Kissing at the same time
