Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early
Boys, we ought'a shut her down
Just take it to the house
âFore anybody starts gettin' crazy
So, I started walkin' across the floor
Before I got to the doorâ¦

Aw naw, somebody just bought a shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay
Aw naw, look at the time, y'all
What happened to coats on, long gone
I should be halfway home, but aw naw

Yeah, girl, I saw you come in
With all of your girl friends
Just cuttin' up and shootin' Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
We're just blowin' off steam
Not lookin' to pick up anybody
So, I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw naw, do you hear that song
The one that just came on
Come on, D.J., what you tryna do
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance once
Show off those jeans you painted on
Aw naw
Aw naw

No, I didn't mean to be here this long
But I tried to leave, so it ain't my fault
No, I didn't mean to be holdin' you
But, tell me, what was I s'posed to do

Aw naw, somebody just bought a shot of that Patron
Hang on, we've been here all night long
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one more song
Show off those jeans you painted on
Aw naw
Yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw
