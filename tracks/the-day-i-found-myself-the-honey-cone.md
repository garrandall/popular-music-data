There's probably a lot of you girls out there
Hung up on a man and you're caught in that old
Familiar way of wanting someone who don't want you
You know, men are full of schemes
And they're masters of getting control of our minds
And making us dependent on them
Hmm! Well, girls
I was in that weaken boat on trouble waters for years
And believe me, I've been through it all
But this fool got wise
I remember the man I used to love or thought I loved
He used to treat me in any old way
But still I love the ground he walked on
I was blind as a bat, and I couldn't see for looking
And when he left, I thought my world ended
But you know, time soon healed my wounds
And I've found my new beginning
I just wish he was here so I could tell him

As I look back on the day you left me
I felt that love had forsaken me
As time went by, tears began to dry
Now I see you never really cared
Life is wonderful when love is shared

The day that I lost you that's the day I found myself

Your love controlled, but never consoled me
I was in love, but so unhappy
So many nights, I was in the cold
When you left, you opened up the door
To a world I'd never seen before

The day that I lost you that's the day I found myself

I found love with someone who needs me
I'm loving life the way it should be
I gave you love, you only used me
And when you left, you hurt yourself
I found identity with someone else

The day that I lost you that's the day I found myself

Now don't you know that you only hurt yourself
I'm so glad you're gone 'cause you made me strong
Oh, bless the day you left
'Cause that's the day I found myself

The day that I lost you that's the day I found myself
You better believe it, now
