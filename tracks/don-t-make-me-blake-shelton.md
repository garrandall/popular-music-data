Girl when I look at you, you look through me
Like I'm not even there
I try not to give up, to be strong but
I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place, your heart is hidin'
I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fightin'


Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me


What if when I'm long gone, it dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear, if I leave here
It's done; I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
Well I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it


Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me (Don't make me)


Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me


(Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go)
Don't make me
Stop lovin' you
(Don't make me)
Stop needin' you
