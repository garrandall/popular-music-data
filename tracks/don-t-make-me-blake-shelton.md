Well I've been thinking 'bout it an' its been too long 
So put them dirty dishes down and leave that laundry alone 
Come on 
Take me by the hand and follow me to our room 
You dont have to tell me this is way over due 
I know, so lets go 

I wanna be with you 
Come let me kiss you 
An' I dont mean a peck on the cheek 
Girl tonight Im making up for lost time 
I hope you gotta good night sleep 
I aint gonna rush it 
Girl youre gonna love it 
Cause I intend to do it right 
But I'll go ahead and warn ya 
This is gonna take all night 

Now I dont understand how life can get in the way 
Of me and the prettiest girl in the world making love 
But it does 

I wanna be with you 
Come let me kiss you 
An' I dont mean a peck on the cheek 
Girl tonight Im making up for lost time 
I hope you gotta good night sleep 
I aint gonna rush it 
Girl youre gonna love it 
Cause I intend to do it right 
But I'll go ahead and warn ya 
This is gonna take all night 

I wanna be with you 
Come let me kiss you 
An' I dont mean a peck on the cheek 
Girl tonight Im making up for lost time 
I hope you gotta good night sleep 
Im gonna pay attention to every square inch of you 
I intend to do this right 
But I'll go ahead and warn ya 
This is gonna take all night 

Yeah I'll show ya how I love ya 
But girl its gonna take all night
