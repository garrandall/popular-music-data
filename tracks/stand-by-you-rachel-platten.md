(Even if we can't find Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven...)


Hands, put your empty hands in mine
And scars, show me all the scars you hide
And hey, if your wings are broken
Please take mine 'til yours can open too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you


Oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I
And love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too


'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you


Yeah, you're all I never knew I needed
And the heart, sometimes it's unclear why it's beating
And love, if your wings are broken
We can brave through those emotions too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you


And oh, truth, I guess truth is what you believe in
And faith, I think faith is having a reason
No, no, no, love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too


'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you


I'll be your eyes 'til yours can shine
I'll be your arms, I'll be your steady satellite
And when you can't rise
Well, I'll crawl with you on hands and knees
'Cause I...


I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through (Come on)
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find Heaven
I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Love, you're not alone
No, I'm gonna stand by you


(Even if we can't find Heaven, Heaven, Heaven...)
I'm gonna stand by you
