I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

I don't know
It's too soon to tell
I think I'm in love

Well, I'm not gonna
Hold you in the night
What I mean is I'd love to
Hold you but I'm gonna
Wait and do it right

Cause I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

But I'm not gonna
Squeeze you in the night
What I mean is I'd love to
Squeeze you but I'm gonna
Wait, wait, wait and do it right

Cause I believe love
Should be free of misery
It should have a good start
Or it will break your heart

I'm not gonna jump in the water
Till I'm ready to swim
Baby, I'm looking out for you
Just like a friend

Cause I don't know
It's too soon to tell
I think I'm in love

I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

But I'm not gonna
Squeeze you in the night
What I mean is I'd love to
Squeeze you but I'm gonna
Wait, wait, wait and do it right

Cause I believe love
Should be free of misery
It should have a good start
Or it will break your heart

I'm not gonna jump in the water
Till I'm ready to swim
Baby, I'm looking out for you
Just like a friend

I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

I don't know
It's too soon to tell
But I think I'm in love

I got to do right
I got to do right...
