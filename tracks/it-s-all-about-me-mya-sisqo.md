I cook your dinner
I wash your clothes
Baby hell no that's not the way it goes
It's all about me tonight
I ain't stop loving you 
Cause you still my boo 
You still my boo 
But you gotta see tonight it's all about me, me, me, me, me


Its all about me me me me me 
Forget about you you you you you
So whatcha gonna do do do do do 
Are ya gonna get it up? get it up ?


Up jumps my butt nigga what nigga what 
U know I caught yo eye checkin out my thigh 
Now swing my body right to left 
Left to right, You know this ish looks tight 
Now just look at my body body uh huh 
And just hold me like a man should (Sisqo:like a nigga should) But baby you gotta see 
Tonight baby, it's all about me (Sisqo Baby)




Do you know that I'm gonna love you for life 
So let's make tonight your night 
Baby my arms are open wide 
So let me come inside, hey hey 
Baby (Mya:oh baby)
Is that what u want from me (Mya:cause thats what i need from you)
