They say that love often passes in a second
And you can never catch it up
So I'm hanging onto you as though eternity beckoned
But it's clear that the match is rough
Common sense'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body's so edible
You give me an overdose of love
But just a little is enough

I'm a connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line, that's true
But all I have to have's a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowin'
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me, but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond on you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body's so edible
You give me an overdose of love
A little is enough
