Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, love me
Ah ha, ah ha, oh, so shy
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, love me
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, oh, yeah

Step by step is nice this way
I'll bring love, love
Love every day

Don't stand by
While it's not your turn
You know by now my dates
Are never the same

(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Oh, so shy

(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Just say love is better now



I want my loved one by my side
Mustn't be so bad
Being the happy man for someone
Who can use his blind love beside you

(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Oh, so shy

(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Just say love is better now



(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Oh, so shy

(You make me funky)
Don't you love me
Don't you love me
Just say love is better now
