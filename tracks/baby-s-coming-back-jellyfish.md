I knew that when I saw her
That my life would soon move over from the fast lane
Gone would be the days of all my drinkin' and my carrying on
But when I settled down
The party king uncrowned
This stubborn memory hadn't faded
Too many dumb mistakes
And all the grief it makes
Left nothing else to be debated


And if you say that you understand then you're lyin'
But if you figure that I'm alright now I can't deny it


Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way


If I had a dollar
For every single time I fought her
I'd buy a handgun (I'd buy a handgun)
But that couldn't shoot away
The bullseye that she made on my heart


And if I sound like a beaten man well I guess so
But on her way is the sweetest prize and I can't let go


Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today (yeah, yeah)
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way


What I told her on the telephone was that I'd been so bad
I wouldn't blame her if she mowed down these wild oats I'd sown
But when she said she'd give me one more chance
I said knock three times when you arrive


Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today (yeah, yeah)
Baby's comin' back, my darlin'
Baby's comin' back this evenin'
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way
