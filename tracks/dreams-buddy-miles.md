They tell me miracles abound now more than ever, but I don't care.  They say it's better to be blessed than it is to be clever, but I don't care. 'Cause I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road, and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care.    For life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer, you keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking  'til the power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you...you....  You don't get nothing for free, 'less of course you steal it,  at least that's what the people say.  The sad irony of Love is how so seldom you feel it, yet it's all you dream about, night and day.  From the splinter in the hand, to the thorn in the heart, to  the shotgun to the head, you got no choice but to learn to glean solace from pain or you'll end up cynical or dead.  Me, I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care.
For life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer,
you keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking and a'talking and a'walking, 'til the power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you there.   The power of Love deliver you...THERE!!!Sometimes you throw yourself into the sea of faith, and  the sharks of doubt come and they devour you.  Other times you throw yourself into the sea of faith only to find the treasure lost in the shipwreck inside of you!  There ain't no guarantees, none of that nonsense like on tv, just gotta roll the dice, and take your lumps. You're gonna get yourself knocked down, so better learn to stand back up, for those who dwell on disaster let sorrow be their master.  Me, I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care.  'Cause life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer, you keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking 'til the power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there.
The power of Love deliver you there.  The power of Love deliver you there.  My buddy Phillip works as a gas station attendant. Strangers call his name to him a thousand times a day. They don't know him, they're just asking "Phillip" for a "fill-up".  Funny how fate plays tricks on us...that way---through the power of Love.
