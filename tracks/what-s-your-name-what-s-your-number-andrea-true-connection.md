I've got to find out, I've got to find out

I went dancin' at the disco last night
I saw this guy, I think I saw the light
I had to find out who he was
I had to find out, I had to find out

What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number

I couldn't believe he was lookin' my way
He turned to his friend, this is what I heard him say
Who is that girl...who is that girl
I've got to find out, I've got to find out

What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number...
I've got to find out, I've got to find out

As I walked up, I gave him a big grin
He looked me up and down and then he looked again
And then he stared at me straight in the eye
And said the words as I gave a sigh

What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number
What's your name, what's your number
I've got to find out, I've got to find out
