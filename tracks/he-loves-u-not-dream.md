Give it your all, girl
Give it all you got
You can take a chance, and take your best shot
I see what you want girl, and whatcha do
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you


You're pulling petals off a flower tryna get your way (Way)
Keep pulling til it says what you wanna say (Say)
Girl, you can pick a field full of daisies, but he'd still be my baby
And I know you can hardly wait til I'm away from him
Instinctively I know what you're thinking (What you're thinking)
You'll be giving him an open invitation
But my baby won't be taken in


You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss (Sweet kiss)
You can flirt your pretty eyes
He ain't got his hands tied


No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me
He loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me
He loves you not


You're the kinda girl that's always up for do-or-dare (Dare)
Only want him just because he's there
Always looking for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side
You're the kind of girl who's not used to hearing no (No)
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go (Go)
Doesn't matter how hard you try
You're never gonna get with my guy


No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants (To do what he wants, yeah)
He's into what he's got (And that's me)
He loves me
He loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me
He loves you not


Doesn't matter what you do (Do)
He's never, never gonna be with you


Give it your all, girl
Give it all you got
You can take a chance, and take your best shot
Say what you want, girl
Do whatcha do
He's never gonna make it with you


You can pout your cherry lips (Yeah)
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss (Sweet kiss)
You can flirt your pretty eyes (Pretty eyes)
He ain't got his hands tied


No chains to unlock (No chains)
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me
He loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you (He's never gonna be with you)
He's into what he's got (Take your best shot)
He loves me (He loves me)
He loves you not
No chains to unlock (No chains)
So free to do what he wants (To do what he wants, yeah)
He's into what he's got (And that's me)
He loves me
He loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you (He's my guy)
He's into what he's got (And that's me)
He loves me
He loves you not


He loves you not
