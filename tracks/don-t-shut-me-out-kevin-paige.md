All I've been thinkin' 'bout something you said
It seems to make no sense to me
That you don't want nobody's love
Just say you won't be hurt again
Won't you let me in?

You don't know what you've been missin'
None of my love and none of my guessin'
I love ya like this, I love ya like that
I bet cha can't take that

Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you'll live your life without
'Cause baby I've got somethin' here

I've been watchin' your body for years
It seems to me you need my help
But you've been drownin' that body in tears
It's time for you to make that change
Baby rearrange

You don't know what you've been missin'
None of my love and none of my guessin'
I love ya like this, I love ya like that
I bet cha can't take that

Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you'll live your life without
'Cause baby I've got somethin' here

Don't shut me out, oh yeah, oh baby
Tell me Tell me
Why in the world do I have to take this?
Why in the hell do you have to make this?
Hard for you, hard for me
Oh girl I love you, can't you see that

Oh, my lovin', I try to give to you
Tell me do you want it?
Or would you rather have me say that
I love you... you... you... yeah
I love ya like this, I love ya like that
I bet you can't take that

Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
Don't shut me out (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you'll live your life without
'Cause baby I've got somethin' here

Baby, don't shut me out
Oh baby you know nothing
Nothing 'bout my girl
Baby I don't believe it
Baby I can't conceive it

Don't shut me out
(Baby don't shut me out)
Don't shut me out
Don't shut me out
Don't shut me out
(Yeah)
Don't shut me out
Don't shut me
Don't Don't
Don't shut me out
