Words of silence echo through this lonely room
Just a photograph and dreams that won't come true
I'll never know why I left you standin' in the rain
Cryin' tears of emptyness it's drivin' me insane

All I wanted was to love you
Never wanted to see you cry
All I need is just to hold you
I just can't say - Goodbye

Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender

You use words as weapons I use love as a shield
So tell me why are we on this battlefield
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way

Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down your arms and baby let's surrender

And thought my aim is true
I sometimes miss the mark
Oh in matters of the heart
But I'd give my life tonight
To hold you in my arms

In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way

I just wanna hold you (surrender)
I just wanna love you (surrender)
I never meant to make you cry

Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers of from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down you arms and baby let's surrender
