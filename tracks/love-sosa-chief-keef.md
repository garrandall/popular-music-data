Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop
"Chief Keef ain't 'bout this, Chief Keef ain't 'bout that
My boy a BD on fucking Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be putting in no work”
Shut the fuck up!
Y'all niggas ain’t know shit!
All ya motherfuckers talk about...
“Chief Keef ain't no hitta, Chief Keef ain't this, Chief Keef a fake”
Shut the fuck up!
Y'all don't be with that nigga!
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since, fuckin', I don't know when!
Motherfucka, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there!
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Chief Keef
I'm fucking beating they ass!
I'm not fucking playing no more!
Y'know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them
(Young Chop on the beat)
Love sosa, bitches love sosa, huh?
Raris and rovers, ayy, lil' Cobra, ayy, ayy
Bang, bang, ayy, got us some rovers


These bitches love Sosa, O End or no end
Fuckin' with them O boys, you gon' get fucked over
Raris and Rovers, these hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra, now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa, you boys ain't making no noise
Y'all know I'm a grown boy, your clique full of broke boys
God, y'all some broke boys, god, y'all some broke boys
We GBE dope boys, we got lots of dough, boy


These bitches love Sosa and they love them Glo' Boys
Know we from the 'Go boy, but we cannot go, boy
No, I don't know ol' boy, I know he's a broke boy
Raris and Rovers, convertible Lambos, boy
You know I got bands, boy, and it's in my pants, boy
Disrespect them O Boys, you won't speak again, boy
Don't think that I'm playin', boy, no, we don't use hands, boy
No, we don't do friends, boy, collect bands, I'm a landlord
I gets lots of commas, I can fuck yo mama
I ain't with the drama, you can meet my llama
Ridin' with 3hunna, with three hundred foreigns
These bitches see Chief Sosa, I swear to God, they honored


These bitches love Sosa, O End or no end
Fuckin' with them O boys, you gon' get fucked over
Raris and Rovers, these hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra, now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa, you boys ain't making no noise
Y'all know I'm a grown boy, your clique full of broke boys
God, y'all some broke boys, god, y'all some broke boys
We GBE dope boys, we got lots of dough, boy


Don't make me call D. Rose, boy, he six double-O, boy
And he keep that pole, boy, you gon' get fucked over
Bitch, I done sell soda and I done sell coca
She gon' clap for Sosa, he gon' clap for Sosa
They do it for Sosa, them hoes, they do it for Sosa
Tadoe off the molly water, so nigga be cool like water
'Fore you get hit with this lava, bitch, I'm the trending topic
Don't care no price, I'll cop it, B and your bitch steady jockin' me


These bitches love Sosa, O End or no end
Fuckin' with them O boys, you gon' get fucked over
Raris and Rovers, these hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra, now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa, you boys ain't making no noise
Y'all know I'm a grown boy, your clique full of broke boys
God, y'all some broke boys, god, y'all some broke boys
We GBE dope boys, we got lots of dough, boy
