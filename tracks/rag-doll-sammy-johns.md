She walks in the field
That's just across the way
Picks all the flowers
That brighten up the day

And her blue velvet cape
That she wore around her neck
And the red in her cheeks
Gave a rag doll effect

And the wind in the trees
Sing a sad, sad, sad song
I lay in my bed
Listening all night long

Oh, wind in the trees
Sing a song for me
Bring back the rag doll to me

Oh, how I long to have her back by my side
The happiness of yesterday
Damn near cost my pride

There ain't nothing worse than losing
When you had everything to gain
Got to get that woman back
Or nothing will be the same

And the wind in the trees
Sing a sad, sad, sad, sad song
I lay in my bed
Listening all night long

Oh, wind in the trees
Sing a song for me
And bring back the rag doll to me

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
