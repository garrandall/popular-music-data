When I look outside my window
What do I see?
And when I look outside my window
So many different people to be yeah
That it's strange, so strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
To rabbits running in a ditch
The hippies out to make it rich
Oh, no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Oh, no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

What's the matter?
Help me somebody help him
And as I look over my shoulder
What do I see?
And as I look over my shoulder
Some ancient fellow I'm longing to be

It's so strange, so strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
To rabbits running in a ditch
The hippies out to make it rich
Oh, no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch yeah
Must be the season of the witch.
