Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down
He's gonna pay the rent
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get
It feels like there's a stranger who's standing in these shoes
But I know I can't lose me, cause then I'd be losing you

I know I promised baby
I would be the one to make our dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the struggles
And the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave
Because I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away


If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me


Pour another cup of coffee
Babe I got something to say to you (I don't wanna die no more)
I ain't got the winning ticket
Not the one that's gonna pull us through (I don't wanna die no more)
No one said that it'd be easy
Let your old man take you home
But know that if you walk out on me that darling
I'd be gone


If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me
Baby, I can take it


It's a bitch, yeah life's a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on


If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us
If that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me
Go on, lie to me
Baby, I can take it
Come on lie to me

Go on, lie to me
Go on, lie to me
Lie to me
Go on, lie to me

Tell me everything's gonna be alright
Come on, get me through the night
