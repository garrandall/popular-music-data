I mix the 400 with the designer, nigga
Stay dangerous
On Bloods
Stay dangerous

I just bought me a handgun, and that shit came with the drum
Do a nigga fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
Eat it up, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Uh, uh, baggage, lumps
Uh, uh, Mr. Klumps
Uh, uh, she on my, nuts
Fuck her once, I don't eat the butt
YG always cuss, YG do too much
Oh my God he always wearin' red, he a super Blood
You niggas super sus, act like y'all be pistoled up
When them shots fire, all you niggas did was duck
Duck, duck, duck, duck
Duck, duck, duck, goose
I don't wanna see boof, uh
Heard that pussy loose, uh
Yeah she with the shits, ayy
Gave me head in the coupe

I just bought me a handgun and that shit came with the drum
Do a nigga fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
Eat it up, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Big gun, handgun, shootout, and 1
Hop out, tap out, time out, damn, son (what?)
Goyard trunks, Gucci trunks
Goku, Trunks, asthma, pump
Uh, uh, hit it once, he done
Crack 'em like Humpty Dumpt'
She wanna fuck, she dumb
Huh, huh, 8th street, cut
Cakey, rum, ice, green
'Cedes truck, night screams
Brady Bunch, wide screen
I was thirteen with fake bling
When Killa Cam was on the corner with the pink mink
My little man was on the corner with the clink clink
Gold link, rolled 8's, bold links
Whole gang hold weight, ho

I just bought me a handgun and that shit came with the drum
Do a nigga fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
Eat it up, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
