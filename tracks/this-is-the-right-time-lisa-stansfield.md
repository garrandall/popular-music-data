This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows if you don't demand, it shows
That you understand the light shining inside us
It's more than tonight, it's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there till the light, to hold you close
You know it's all you will ever need,
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows it's a special thing, it's a love
that will never, ever be wrong, 'cause this love is strong
You know it's all you will ever need,
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love

So when you know that there's someone you want
And you want them so tonight, more than you've ever done anyone
You know it's all you will ever need,
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love

Well, do you believe, baby?
'Cause I believe, baby
Do you believe, baby?
Believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time 
I can see it in your eyes
This is the right time to believe in love
