Tonight I came home early
'Cause I just couldn't wait to see you
You were on my mind
Lately I've been thinkin', baby (Yeah, I've been thinkin')
Of all the ways I can make you happy
And tonight I'm gonna try


So just unwind (Just unwind)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Leave them behind)
Let's make love (Nice and slow)


Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Wanna love you tonight, yeah)
Slow and easy


As we lay we can
Just explore each other's treasures
They're not hard to find
We know the secret (Yeah)
Of how to make each other happy
I know yours and you know mine


So just unwind (Just unwind)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Leave them behind)
Let's make love (All I wanna do is make sweet love to you)


Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna take my time)
Slow and easy (Slow and easy)


Come to me, baby
No, no, no there's no need to worry
The kids are all asleep, yeah yeah yeah
I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
I can see it in your eyes, oh


Just unwind (You better unwind, girl)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Baby, won't you leave your cares behind)
Let's make love (All I wanna do, all I wanna do is make love)


Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna love you slow and easy)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Let's make love, yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(We don't have to worry 'bout nothing else)
Slow and easy (Slow, yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna take my time)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(That's the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy (Slow and easy)


Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy
