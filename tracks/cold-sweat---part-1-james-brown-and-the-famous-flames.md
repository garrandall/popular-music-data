I don't care, about your past
I just want, our love to last
I don't care, darlin', about your faults, ha
I just want to satisfy your pulse
OH!


When you kiss me
When you miss me
Hold my hand
Make me understand
I break out - in a cold sweat

Ho! Uh! Ho!


I don't care, about your wants
I just wanna, ha, tell ya about the do's and don'ts
I don't care about the way you treat me, darlin', ha
I just want, to understand me, honey
OH!


When you kiss me
And ya miss me
You hold me tight
Make everything all right
I break out - in a cold sweat


Maceo, come on now, brother
Put it, put it where it's at now
AHH, let me have it
