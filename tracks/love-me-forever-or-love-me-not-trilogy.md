Fell in love with a black suit
I left 'cause that's what blacks do
You think that you're the only one
We can change the facts too
Dressed nice just like a pack of rats do (money)
Make it last forever like a tattoo
Tried to keep it all together
But it all fell apart like some bad glue

It's Aha
Lately I feel like college was the biggest waste of time of my life
Just to get a job that makes me hate the weekdays and turn up on Friday nights
I'ma work a 9-5 I really hate my co-workers but I'm finna smile
And I look so fly up in this suit and tie
People think I'm all that
Well guess what, I think I'm all that and I think about suicide
No nevermind I'mma pay for her dinner and say good night but I already know she gon' say come inside
A roller coaster or a baby stroller let's take a ride
If I said it's everything I ever wanted I would be lying
I'm sorry

Blessed and highly favoured
It's just me and all my gangsters
We ain't asking for no favors
'Cause we've been getting money over here, cool (Money... Cometh... To me... Now)
Blessed and highly favoured
It's just me and all my gangsters
We ain't askin for no favors (why)
'Cause we've been getting money over here (Money... Cometh... To me)
'Cause we've been getting money over here
Work hard tryna get my stacks up
(Money... Cometh... To me)
Everybody on my team racked up
Work hard tryna get my stacks up
(Money... Cometh... To me)
Everybody on my team racked up
'Cause we've been getting money over here
Work hard tryna get my stacks up
(Money... Cometh... To me)
Everybody on my team racked up
Work hard tryna get my stacks up
(Money... Cometh... To me)
Everybody on my team racked up

If I had million dollars
I would try and buy you the world
I would go out my way each and every day just to give you what you deserve
Psych I'm lyin I'm finna get some Jordans (Money... Cometh... To me)
Finna get some jewelry just to feel important
Finna go and get a foreign ride imported
Even paid my tithes so praise the Lord!
In college I learned that Mr. Krabs don't like Pearl (Money... Cometh... To me)
I learned that you don't have to wait yo' turn
I learned that if ya money right you can do what you want 'cause refunds run the world
I learned not to take 'em out to eat (Money... Cometh... To me)
'Cause another guy gone give Capri Suns to that girl
Some things only God can fix and there's no disrespect or shade meant for uncle Earl
Rapping while I'm bagging groceries
White chord in my ear even though it wasn't supposed to be
My ex girl the cashier and I'd be lying if I didn't admit at one point she was close to me
To tell the truth it only got worse
Any other rapper probably have to start cursing
Thought I was overthinking when I seen they was flirting but her new man is now a co-worker
But it was still a good day, not the weekend
But it was Thursday, I really wasn't tripping see
'Cause it was payday dang I just said day three times wack rhymes, nah that's a trilogy
Anyways that's gas money
'Cause we got a show tomorrow even rented an Infiniti
Maybe if I get a whole lot a money
They'll regret not keeping me

Blessed and highly favoured
It's just me and all my gangsters
We ain't askin for no favors
'Cause we've been getting money over here, cool (Money... Cometh... To me... Now)
