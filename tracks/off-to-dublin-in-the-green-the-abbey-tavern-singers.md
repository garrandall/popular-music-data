I am a merry ploughboy and
I ploughed the fields all day
Till a sudden thought
Came into my head
That I should roam away

For I'm tired of civilian life
Since the day that I was born
So I'm off to join the I.R.A.
And I'm off tomorrow morn


So we're off to Dublin'
In the green, in the green
Where the helmets
Glisten in the sun
Where the bayonets flash
And the rifles crash to the
Echo of a Thompson Gun

Oh, I leave behind
My old gray home
I leave behind my plough
And I leave behind
My old gray mare
For no more I'll need 'em now

And I leave behind my Mary
She's the one that I adore
And I wonder will
She think of me when she
Hears the rifles roar



Oh, some men fight for silver
And some men fight for gold
But the I.R.A. are fighting for
The land the Saxons stole



And when the war is over
And dear old Ireland's free
I will take her to the church to wed
A rebel's wife she'll be
