Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah yeah, little sister don't you do what your big sister done

You know, I dated your big sister
Oh, I took her to the show
Hey, I went for some candy
And along came Jim Dandy
And they slipped right out the door

Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister don't you do what your big sister done

I used to pull down on your pigtails
Hey girl, pinch your turned-up nose
Oh, but baby you've been growin'
And lately it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes

Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister don't you do what your big sister done

Hup, hup, hup!
All get on!

Every time I see your sister
Lord, she's with somebody new
Oh, she's mean and she's evil
Like a little old boll weevil
Think I'll try my love with you

Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister don't you do what your big sister done
Well, little sister don't you do what your big sister done
Oh, little sister don't you do what your big sister done
