Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done


Well, I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door


Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done


Every time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that little old boll weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you


Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done


Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growing
And baby, it's been showing
From your head down to your toes


Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done


Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done
