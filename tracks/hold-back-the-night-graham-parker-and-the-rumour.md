Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
When you left you took the sun right out of my sky, yes you did
Wonder why you went away, and never told me why
When the sun go down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appear
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Loneliness, haunting me when I go to bed yes I do
Like a character in a book, that I have read
When the sun go down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appear

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
I said hold back the right, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the light
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night
Turn on the light
Hold back the night, turn on the light
