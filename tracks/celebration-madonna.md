Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight
Partyin' until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, you'll stay right by my side
So let's enjoy the celebration


Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
(Celebration!)
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration!)


I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher? Get closer to the fire
I don't know what you're waiting for


Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight
Partyin' until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, you'll stay right by my side
So let's enjoy the celebration


Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
(Celebration!)
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration!)


Boy you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life


Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight
Partyin' until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, you'll stay right by my side
So let's enjoy the celebration


Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
(Celebration!)
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration!)


I got you burnin' up, girl, 'cause I'm on fire
Turn it up, girl, you can't deny
Ain't enough birds to make me fly
Got the thang bang, feel good to make you hot
I know they told you that I was trouble
Break it down, girl, and I ain't gon' lie
Do you still wanna come closer to me
Or are you shy?

Let me wrap my arms around you, baby girl
Couldn't match this night if I searched all around the world
Standing around in a circle
In the middle of the dance floor

Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight
Partyin' until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, you'll stay right by my side
So let's enjoy the celebration


Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
(Celebration!)
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration!)
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
(Celebration!)
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration!)
