I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for


Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher? Get closer to the fire
I don’t know what you’re waiting for


Come join party
Yeah
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
Yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you


Boy you got a reputation
But you’re gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for


Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life


Come join party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you


Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance? Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on

What are you waiting for?


Come join party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you


Boy, you got it
It’s a celebration
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let’s get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got it
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let’s get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
