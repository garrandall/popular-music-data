Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Somethings bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says don't worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby

I guess I shouldve kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now
I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says don't worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby

She told me baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you know how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you

Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says don't worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby
