Here comes summer
School is out, oh happy days
Here comes summer
Gonna grab my girl and run away
If she's willing
We'll go steady right away
Now let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home

Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Almost June, the sun is bright
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna see her every night
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Lots more time to hold her tight
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home

School's not so bad but the summer is better
They give me more time to see my girl
Walk through the park beneath the shiny moon
Oh when we kiss she makes my hair curl

Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Feel her lips so close to mine
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
When we meet her eyes both shine
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Let's have summer all the time
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home

Here comes summer (here comes summer)
School is out, oh happy days
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna grab my girl and run away
If she's willing (here comes summer)
We'll go steady right away
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home

Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Almost June, the sun is bright
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna see her every night
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Lots more time to hold her tight
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home
