No
Is not an answer
On and on I try to understand you see
Love
Is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me
Can you feel it 
Or can't you see 
I'll never hurt someone as much I know
When you see me 
It's what you'll get 
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel



Don't know, don't know

If you don't know
It won't hurt you

Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you, ooo ooo ooo
You 
You play with fire
I know one day you're gonna be the one to burn
Love 
Is like a game haaa
What goes around comes around you wait your turn
It's a feelin' 
To change with time 
We'll always be together wait and see
If you know me 
That's what you'll get 
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel



Don't know, don't know

If you don't know
It won't hurt you
What you don't know
Don't know
What you don't know
Might hurt you

Don't know

Don't know

Don't know oh ho oh

If you don't know
It won't hurt you

Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you
(Music break)

Know what I got
Hey hey hey

Not here not now not anywhere

Know what I got
Hey hey hey

If you don't know
You won't let go
What you don't know

No no no no no no no no no


Don't know, don't know

Whoa no no no no no no no no no no


Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you

Ho no no no no no no no

No no no no no no


Na na na no no no no

Na na na no no no no

Let me tell you what you don't know won't hurt you baby

Something that you don't know won't you hurt no
I don't wanna hurt you baby no
I don't wanna hurt you baby no
I don't wanna hurt you baby no oh oh no no
If you don't know
You won't let go
What you don't know oh oh
Na na na na na......
