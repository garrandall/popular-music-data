Walk down the aisle
Walk down the aisle

Every minute seems just like an hour
Every hour, such a long, long while

Til the day (til the day)
Til the day (til the day)
When we walk down the aisle

Can't help dreaming
All about her charms
Of her arms and her face
And her smile

I can't wait (I can't wait)
Til the day (til the day)
When we walk down the aisle

I can almost feel the organ playing
And my heart fills with delight
For soon, I'll be near my dear one
Who found me and brought me the light

Then the moment I'm longing for
How proud I will feel when I say
Yes, I do (yes, I do)
Yes, I do (yes, I do)

I'll be true forever
When we walk down the aisle
When we walk down the aisle
