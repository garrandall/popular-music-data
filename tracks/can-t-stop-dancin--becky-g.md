The lights are shining like the sun out tonight
Just keep your body moving how I like
Oh yeah, the music feels like paradise
Can't get any better, no
I wanna stay right in this moment for life
Baby, treat me wrong, treat me right


Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancin'
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go let go of me
Don't let go let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancin'


Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now


Your mind is going places I can feel
That further lets me know this is real
And I won't stop, you know I like it there
You can even go further, babe
'Cause nothing's forbidden
Don't be scared, no worries
Once I'm there, all is forgiven
So be prepared
To come and push up on my...


Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancin'
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go let go of me
Don't let go let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancin'


Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now


Believe it, I feel it
It's in the air
Although you can't see it, you know it's there
My heart keeps on racin', in overdrive
Once the music hits my body, I feel so alive
And it's alright
It's got me like...


Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancin'
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go let go of me
Don't let go let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancin'
Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancin'
Ay ay ay, aye
I don't wanna chance it
So don't let go let go of me
Don't let go let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancin'
