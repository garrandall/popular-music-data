Out of love, there's nobody around
All I hear is the sound of a broken heart
Out of time, no more waiting for you
Now the hurting is through, and a new day starts
And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights
And made it alive


Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love


Out of touch, with myself for so long
Now a feelin' so strong coming over me
Down the line, there's a lesson I've learned
You can love and get burned, if it has to be
And I see a change in my life
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside
And I realize

And I feel a change in my life
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside and I realize

No it can't be your love, no it can't be your love
No it can't be your love
