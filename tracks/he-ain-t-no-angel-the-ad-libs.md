He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright
(That's alright)

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright
(But it's alright)

Well, I don't want a lover
With a halo round his head
My sugar baby wears a
Stench of brim instead

Yeah, he's got a little bit
Of devil down is his soul

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But I don't care
(She don't care)

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But I don't care
(I'll love you right)

He didn't fly down from Heaven
With white wings on his back
He flew in from Kansas City
In a big, fat Cadillac

Yeah, he said he made his break
Playing rock and roll

(I ain't no angel)
No, sure not
(I'm not an angel)
No, no, but I don't
Want nobody but you

(I ain't no angel)
No, no, no
(I'm not an angel)
No, but nobody else will do

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright
(That's alright)

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright now
(It's gonna be alright)

You know he sleeps til sundown
And he keeps me up all night
And when it comes to loving
That boy, he's outta sight

Yeah, you know he makes
Me lose my self control

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright
(That's alright)

He ain't no angel
(I ain't no angel)
But that's alright now
(It's gonna be alright)
