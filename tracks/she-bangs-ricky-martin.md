Talk to me, tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse, and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb... yeah baby

Talk to me, tell me your sign
You're switchin' sides like a Gemini
You're playing games
And now you're hittin' my heart
Like a drum... yeah baby

Well if Lady Luck
Gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Til she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks


She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she
Looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history

She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me
That a woman's got one thing on her mind

Talk to me, tell me the news
You'll wear me out like a pair of shoes
We'll dance all night until the band goes home
Then you're gone... yeah baby

Well, if it looks like love
Should be a crime
They better lock me up for life
I'll do the time
With a smile on my face
Thinkin' of her in her
Leather and lace


She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she
Looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history

Man, if Lady Luck
Gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Till she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks


She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she
Looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
