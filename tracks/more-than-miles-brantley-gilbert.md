Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal


Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do?
There's more than miles in my rearview

Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south


Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they says a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do?
There's still more than miles in my rearview

Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her (damn)


So I'm turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can't put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I'm supposed to do, yeah
There's still more than miles in my rear view

More than miles, yeah
More than miles
