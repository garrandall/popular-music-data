All The Homies They Know What I Mean
Baby Let Me Show U How I Lean (Like A Cholo)

Lay Back Bounce In The Clube
When We Do A Dance Ya We Do It Like What

(Like A) Like A Cholo

Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side
Like A Cholo

All Up In The Clube Tan Beat
Lookin For Some Highness
We On The Tree
I Neeed A Bad One A Real Freak
Find Them At The Dance Floor So Don't Sleep

Damn I Like U Like U But A Really Want Her
Shes That Type I Can Tell Let Me Get Into Beat Take Her Back To The Hotal
But Right Now I'm On The Move
Show This Little Momma How A Gangsta Grove

I Don't Do A Whole Lot Just Enogh
Atleast I Decide To Keep My Elbows Up
Like This And Like That
All The Girls Know Where The Real G's At
You Could Find Us Way Up In The Back
Whatching That Ass Bounce Like A Low Low


I Lean Like A Cholo
Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side
Elbows Up Side To Side


Like A Cholo
I'm Brown I Get Down
The Girls Love How I Lean
Like A G To The Beat
Doing Why Mj's On My Feet

I'm Lookin Real Good I'm So Hood
Tryin To Stay Clean If U Know What I Mean

Pockets Full Of Feria
Mucho Dinero Look Me In The Eye Tell Me Pappy Te Quero

Let Me Do My Dance U Do Yours
Shakin What U Got Till Ur Sweating Out Ur Poors

Just Like That Ya I Like That

Ima Perro Trying To Tase That Cat
Hey Dj Won't U Play That Same Track
(Whined It Back) I Can Lean To That

Now She Wants Me
And I Ain't Going Home Solo Beacuse I Lean Like A Cholo


Like A Cholo

All The Homies They Know What I Mean
Baby Let Me Show U How I Lean Like A Cholo

Lay Back Bounce In The Clube
When We Do A Dance Ya We Do It Like What

All The Homies They Know What I Mean
Baby Let Me Show U How I Lean Like A Cholo
