Why can I be like any guy?
Why do they try and make me run? Son of a gun

Now what do they care about the clothes I wear?
Why get their kicks from making fun

Yeah, this world's got a lot of space
And if they don't like my face
It ain't me that's going any where, no

So I don't care then laugh at me
If that's so fair, I have to beg to be free
Then, baby, laugh at me and I'll cry for you
And I'll pray for you and I'll do all the things
That the man up stairs says to do
I'll do 'em for you, I'll do 'em, I'll do 'em all for you

It's gotta start some place
It's gotta start some how
I'll make that other cheek mine
And maybe the next guy
That don't wear a silk tie
He can walk by and say hi
Say hi instead of why
Instead of why
Instead of why, babe
Instead of why
What did I do to you?
