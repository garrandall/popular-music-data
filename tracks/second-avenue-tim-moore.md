Since we can no longer make it, girl
I've found a new place to live my life
It's really no place at all
Just a hole in the wall, you see
It's cold and dusty but I let it be
Livin' here without you
On Second Avenue

And since our stars took different paths
I guess I won't be shavin' in your looking glass
Guess my old friendly grin
Must have started to dim, somehow
And I certainly don't need it now
Still, I keep smiling through
On Second Avenue

I can still see you standing
There on the third-floor landing
The day you visited we hardly said a word

Outside it was rainin'
You said you couldn't be stayin'
And you went back to your flowers and your birds

Since we can no longer see the light
The way we did when we kissed that night
Then all the things that we felt
Must eventually melt and fade
Like the frost on my window pane
Where I wrote: "I am you"
On Second Avenue

I can still see you standing
There on the third-floor landing
The day you visited we hardly said a word

Outside it was rainin'
You said you couldn't be stayin'
And you went back to your flowers and your birds

Since we can no longer see the light
The way we did when we kissed that night
Then all the things that we felt
Must eventually melt and fade
Like the frost on my window pane
Where I wrote: "I am you"
On Second Avenue
