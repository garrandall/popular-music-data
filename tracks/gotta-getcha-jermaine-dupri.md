I been watching you for so damn long but I don't know what to say or do,
I be sittin' around fantasizin' bout' what I wanna do to you,
Here's somethin' about the way you move your body I can't take,
Specially when you turn around and you make ur ass shake,
You da the number one most requested in the club like one of my jams,
But no matter what when I come in your right here where I am,
Breakin' it down like we in bed,
Gotta a nigga spendin' up all his bread,
Bendin' over to the front,
Lookin' back at me like whatcha want,



I gotta getcha getcha getcah getcha,
Someday, Someday,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
If it's the last thing that I do,

I gotta getcha, I gotta getcha,
And it don't matter if that's ur bitch wit'cha,
Cause my man's here too so let's switch up,
And we be lookin' at each other get the picture,
And my body not Beyonce' but big girls we been holdin' it down,
And light-skin used to be way in but brown-skin is tha hot shit now,
And don't take me as a one-hit wonder keep me hangin' out on the show,
Ya betta act like I'm tha real deal and real bitches i'm tha last one left,
Might not see me up in a thong but i'll be rockin' my addais suit,
Ur chick can put a tight dress on but she still won't look this cute,



I gotta getcha getcha getcah getcha,
Someday, Someday,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
If it's the last thing that I do,

Shit if that's the case baby what's it gon' take for us to get it jumped off right now (Right Now)
I got check books, credit cards, all that shit just tell me hows it gotta go down,
And usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though (Kay)
Cause you super bad and for real though (Kay)
Ohh can't wait for my lips to kiss ur lips both sets but you don't hear me though, (Hear me thought)



Oh Yes,
I wanna splurge wit' ur credit cards let me drive ur car all up and down the boulevard,
Ain't fittin' to talk playa go do ya part yeah I like ur southern draw might letcha eat it raw,
Is ya really hard don't stop get it ya'll down by law let me take ya to the titty bar,
These chicks ain't shit I mean none of ya'll,
Come on get it get it run up in the suga bars,



I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
Someday, Someday,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
If it's the last thing that I do,

I gots to getcha no matter what it takes,
I gots to getcha and I won't make mistakes,
Baby I gots to getcha like I told you before,
And I'm gon' getcha bets believe me for sure,



I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha,
If it's the last thing that I do.
