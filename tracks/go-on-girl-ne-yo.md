I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude, no, I'm not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking me, Earl James and Jimmy
Yep, she had plenty
But love for me, she didn't have any


I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on


Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl


I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Tried to settle down and look what I get
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks from many men
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends
Just not knowing, truly not knowing
I look back now like, "Man, I was open"


I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on


Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl


The mistake I made is clear
(We never should've been together)
That's the reason you're not here
(I know that I can do much better)
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby, I'm feeling no stress
I'm too fly to be depressed
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Hey, oh


Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl


Go on girl
Go on girl
Go on girl
I'll be fine
