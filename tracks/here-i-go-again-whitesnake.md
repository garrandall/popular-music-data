I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone

But I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
I am gonna hold on
For the rest of my days

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
I have made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go
Here I go again
