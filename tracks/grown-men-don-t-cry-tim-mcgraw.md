I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away


But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry


Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind


And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry


I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
"I haven't had my story yet"

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
"I love you dad"


And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry
