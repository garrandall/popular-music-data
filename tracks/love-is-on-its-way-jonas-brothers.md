Young hearts,
I believe if we are not far
from becoming who we truly are
Love is on it's way

Dreamers, 
you see everything in color
while the world is getting darker
Love is on it's way


So, hold on another day
Cause love is on it's way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on it's way
It's alright,you'll find 
a brighter day
cause love it on it's way


Leaders, 
show us how to love each other
It could help us to recover
Love is on it's way
Lonely, 
I believe if you find me
Then together we will truly see
Love is on it's way

Yeahh


So, hold on another day
Cause love is on it's way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on it's way
Its alright, you'll find
a brighter day
cause love is on it's way

Yeahh

Hold, on another day
Cause love is on it's way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
cause love is on it's way
it's alright, you'll find
a brighter day
cause love is on it's way
Cause love is on it's way
cause love is on it's... way
