This little girl of mine
She's as cold as ice
I asked her did she love me?
She told me, no dice

How can I make her love me?
How can I make her mine?

This little girl of mine
Treats me like her brother
Can't that little girl see
I want to be her lover

I try to make her love me
With everything that I know how

Mission impossible
Mission impossible
Mission impossible
She just can't be loved
She just can't be loved

This little girl of mine
She's like a statue in the park
Sometimes I wonder
If that little girl's got a heart

How can I make her love me?
How can I make her mine?

Never see an answer
To this mystery
But I know it's gonna take
A better man than me

I try to make her love me
With everything that I know how

Mission impossible
Mission impossible
Mission impossible
She just can't be loved
{ Repeat and fade out }
