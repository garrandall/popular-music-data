Well, I remember way back when
I must've been 9 or 10
When I saw my very first band
Playing a little Dixieland
Yeah, I knew immediately
That's where I wanted to be
With them boys up on the stand
Playin' in a honky-tonk band

One of the boys
Making beautiful noise
Playing with my friends
Until the music ends
One of the boys

Well, it's plain to see, I got my wish
And I've been lucky ever since then
And one day, I'm meeting my maker
I don't know where or when
But I still love the gypsy life
Yeah, I'm still havin' fun
And though I ain't gettin' any younger, I'm a
Long way from done

One of the boys
I'm making beautiful noise
Yeah, playing with my friends
Until the music ends
One of the boys
Making soulful noise
Rollin' down the road
Headed for another show
Just one of the boys

Standin' on stage on a Friday night
Feelin' the warmth of the old spotlight
Got my guys on my left and my right
Said "Hey, boys
Make a little noise"
Me and the boys
Woo!

Now time has passed, things have changed
I've seen 'em come and go
I lost a lot of my very best friends
And I still miss 'em so
And when I look up in the sky
I see all of them guys
Up there smilin', shining bright
And everything is alright

One of the boys
I'm making beautiful noise
Yes, I'm playing with my friends
Until the music ends
One of the boys
Making soulful noise
I'm rollin' down the road
A-headed for another show
Making beautiful noise
Me and the boys
It's a beautiful noise
Just one of the boys
