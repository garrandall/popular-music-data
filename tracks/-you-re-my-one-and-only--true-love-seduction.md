Ohhhh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When you came into my life
You showed me what true love was meant to be
You brought light into my shadows
And made me be your number one priority
And when you hold me in your arms
The rest of the world seems to disappear
I'm in heaven when I'm with you
And for the first time I can tell it's real
You're my one and only
My one and only true love, true love
(You're my) you're my one and only (my one and only)
My one and only true love, true love, true love
Ohhhh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So many times before
I thought that I had really found true love
But all I really found
Was someone who would abuse my love
Seduction, surrender, to a feeling
That is oh, so new
My heart is on fire, so I'm giving all my love to you
Ohhhh-oh
You're my one and only
My one and only true love, true love
You're my one and only
My one and only true love, true love
(Ohhhh-oh) You're my one and only
(Ohhhh-oh) My one and only true love (oh-oh) true love
(Ohhhh-oh) You're my one and only
(Ohhhh-oh) My one and only true love (oh-oh) true love
(Ohhhh-oh) True love
We're two great tastes that taste great together
We'll be around forever and ever
A symbol of love that will last through time
A river in France, a statue in the Guggenheim
Tight like a punch from a Mike Tyson blow
I'm in love
You're my one and only
It's you and only you
Just you, that I want to share my life with
No one in this world
Can bring me all the joy
All the joy you bring
You're my one and only
My one and only true love, true love
You're my one and only
My one and only true love, true love
(Ohhhh-oh) You're my one and only
(Ohhhh-oh) My one and only true love (oh-oh) true love
(Ohhhh-oh) You're my one and only
(Ohhhh-oh) My one and only true love (oh-oh) true love
