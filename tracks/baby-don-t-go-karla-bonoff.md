Chorus:
You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go

I see it in your face
In your eyes - when you turn away
You think it's all a waste
You're going today

I won't pretend
I won't say it - won't hurt me bad
Won't you try it agaon
What ever happened - to all what we had

Chorus:
You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go

Solo

Bridge:
Don't fight, just hold me tight
Everything is gonna work out right
I won't beg, but you heard what I said
I need you ev'ry day and night

Chorus:
You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go

And if you close the door
I can't wish you well anymore
You really turned me on
So don't come running back
'cause I know you'll never see

Chorus:
You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Uuh, Uuh, Huh, Baby don't go
