Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me


This world has lost it's glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love, right now
There'll be no other time
And I can show you how, my love

Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me


You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say


It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away


You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say


It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
