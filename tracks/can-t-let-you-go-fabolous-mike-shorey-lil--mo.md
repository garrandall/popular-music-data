Listen girl you know my situation,
you know my problems and the shit that I'm facin'
i told you everything you need to know about the kid,
you kept it realer than my friends with the shit you did.
i got caught up, and I never talk up
i look at you and feel some way like baby pass some more cups
and then I'm drinking and yawning and sinking and falling
you know I like my milk in the morning, ha
but I thank yeah, always me and her
no matter what time you would always answer
for that, I should'a put some diamonds on a ring
fuck what anybody says you're a diamond in this ting


but I have to let you go
coz I don't wanna hurt no one no more
i'm sorry I can't do this no more
i don't wanna let you go
girl I really wanna be with you, wanna be real with you
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm in the wrong
but I have to let you go
you're the only one I want in my life
i wish I could make you my wife
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm living wrong
so I have to let you go


you were worried every time that I leave the crib
even more when its a pouch that I'm leaving with
you never knew if I'd make it back home and you sat there stressed keepin' your eyes on that phone,
got a million bitches, but they ain't you
you heard a few rumors, but they ain't true
i miss it when you get me mad
then I diss you then I kiss, then that feeling when you look up that you dissed me then I kiss, uh
we used to fri non stop
i make you cum then you get on top
we had some time ill never forget baby,
not a moment with you I regret baby


but I have to let you go
coz I don't wanna hurt no one no more
i'm sorry I can't do this no more
i don't wanna let you go
girl I really wanna be with you, wanna be real with you
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm in the wrong
but I have to let you go
you're the only one I want in my life
i wish I could make you my wife
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm living wrong
so I have to let you go

girl I really wanna be with you, wanna be real with you
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm in the wrong
but I have to let you go
you're the only one I want in my life
i wish I could make you my wife
i can't leave you alone
i know I'm living wrong
so I have to let you go
