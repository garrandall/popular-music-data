Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, we been wilin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, we been wilin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, we been wilin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, we been wilin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, we been wilin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, we been wilin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright
