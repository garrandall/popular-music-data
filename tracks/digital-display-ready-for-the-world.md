Digital, display
No smoking
No smoking sir
Digital
Does anyone have any time to play?
No smoking
Does anyone have any?

1, 1, 1 no smoking
2, 2, 2
3, 3, 3 no smoking sir
4, 4, 4

I could go on counting for hours, the things that I like
Please don't move baby stay right here, stay right inside
I don't mind if you turn your back on me, cause I know you're still good
Even if I wanna turn on a light, in this position I don't think I could

36, I always dreamed of your measurements in neon lights
24, at Christmas baby maybe you can light up
My room and brighten up my nights, 36

I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display

Digital display, I wish your music start to flow
Digital display, to make your digits want to show
Digital display, I could turn you off by day
From your digital display

You always did know how to make one beg
For they already should have had
But since I know how to make you digits show I feel that I don't have to
Ask take my hand and ill take you yours and well guide in the right way
And when its there you can tell your friends
How you made my digit display?

You're what I've been waiting for to raise my low score
Cause I've been striking out all day and it makes me feel this way

Digital display, like I can't get no
Digital display, when the going gets tough
Digital display, I just want my part to play
With your digital display

I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display

Digital display, I wish your music start to flow
Digital display, to make your digits want to show
Digital display, I could turn you off by day
From your digital display

Digital digital, display display, digital
Can I play?

1, 1, 1
2, 2, 2
3, 3, 3
4, 4, 4

I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display

Digital display, I wish your music start to flow
Digital display, to make your digits want to show
Digital display, I could turn you off by day
From your digital display

Digital display
