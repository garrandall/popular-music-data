Ever since we've been together
You've been buggin' me about
Another woman
Yes you have

I'm gettin' sick and tired
Of bein' accused
I'm gonna make it through, honey
Yes I am

But when I come home from work
I can hardly
Close my eyes

You keep buggin' me and naggin' me about
Some hearsay and jive
Ohhh, yeah yeah...

You've never seen me do nothin' wrong
When I get my check
I bring it home
And you still runnin' me with that
He said, she said, you did it

All this gossip going around in this neighborhood
Oh yeah!
Neighbors talkin' about neighbors
And that's no good
No it ain't, baby

And you tellin' me about what Shirley said
Honey, that ain't true

But did Shirley tell you
What she was really tryin' to do?
I know she didn't, baby

She was tryin' to get me
To go to the Holiday Inn
And she's supposed to be your so-called friend

And you're still runnin' to me
With that he-said, she-said, you did it


You know you keep tellin' me about how tired you are
Well I'm the one that's tired of that hearsay jive, baby
Every time I walk out of my door, I'm staring Shirley right in the face
And she's tellin' me about some woman you were with the night before


Look here, I don't care nothin' about what Shirley said, you know?
Hey, and I don't worry 'bout what the preacher said, it wasn't nothin' about honor, and-and, you know, faith, and things
You gonna have faith in me, you know?
I'm your man


But Shirley's my best friend


Look here, lemme tell ya somethin'
I don't want her comin' over to my house no more. I don't want her comin' over
Hey, I guess I'm tellin' ya, I don't want it
I don't want it. It's okay, just here, look, look...

You never seen me do nothin' wrong
When I get my check
I bring it home
And you still runnin' to me with that
He said, she said, you did it

That's a lie, baby!
I can't take no more, no!
They're tryin' to break up our happy home
You know, honey, I would do you no wrong
That hearsay jive, ain't nothin' but talk
They're tryin' get me to pack my bags and walk
That hearsay jive don broke up a lot of homes
Oh, that hearsay jive will make you do things wrong...
