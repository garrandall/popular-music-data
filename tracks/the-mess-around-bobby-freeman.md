New dance that just hit town
New dance that just hit town
New dance that just hit town
New dance that just hit town
New dance that just hit town
It's called the mess around

Well, everybody's doing that dance
From America all the way to France
They've even doing it across the land
They've got them doing it on Bandstand

That dance that just hit town
Which is called the mess around

Me and my baby do that dance
When we're walking down the street
Me and my baby do that dance
Every time we meet

That dance that just hit town
Which is called the mess around, hey

Well, first you glide
Then you slide
Then you and your partner
Walk side by side

Round and round, up and down
Then you're doing the mess around

If you don't know how
To do the dance right now
Watch me and I'll show you how

First you glide, then you slide
Then you and your partner
Walk side by side

Then you're doing the dance
That just hit town
Which is called the mess around

Hey, hey (let's do the mess around)
Hey, hey (let's do the mess around)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Let's do the mess around)
Hey, hey (let's do the mess around)

Mess around (mess around)
Mess around (mess around)
Mess around (let's do the mess around)

I said, come on, baby
(Let's do the mess around)
Come on, baby (let's do the mess around)
Come on, baby (let's do the mess around)
Come on, baby (let's do the mess around)
