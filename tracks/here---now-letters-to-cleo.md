You boy ain't nothing but trouble
The kind I ain't seen in awhile
And I gotta get me out of here

Don't go and ask crazy any questions
Like I maybe don't know what I'm doin'
And I gotta get me out of here

The farthest thought and I simply thought things were right from now on here
Just got here and I'm leavin'
Smile and think of it but don't leave 'em dead or mix me up in it
'Cause I'm gone and you can't make me stay

It would appear I've been here lots and lots of times before
So please don't laugh
And I wait out in the hallway
Now diggin' back it's a big mistake
And one I've made before
And I would like to be out
Out in the hallway

You boy ain't nothing but trouble
The kind I ain't seen in awhile
And I gotta get me out of here

Get me out of
Get me out of
Get me out of
Get me out of
Get me out of
Get me out of
Get me out of here
