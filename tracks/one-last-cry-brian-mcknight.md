My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on a shelf I saw you
Holding hands standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
I gave my best to you
Nothing for me to do

But I have one last cry
One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind
This time stop living in lie
I guess I'm done to my last cry

I was here you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do

But I have one last cry
One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind
This time stop living a lie

I know I've gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on
And on, and on...

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after my hand and my...

One last cry, one last cry
Before I'll leave it all behind
Ive gotta put you out of my mind
For the very last time
Believe in lie, I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down, I guess I'm down
To my last cry...
