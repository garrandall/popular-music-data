Please don't mind what I'm trying to say 'cause I'm, I'm being honest
When I tell you that you
You're part of the reason I'm so set on the rest of my life
Being a part of you
You tell me what you think about being open,
About being honest with yourself

'Cause things will never be the same.

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning while I'm falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

And don't waste time getting to the point, 'cause I'm, I'm patiently waiting
For your next phone call, your next excuse for losing sleep again
Tell me what you think about being open,
About being honest with yourself

'Cause things will never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning while I'm falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

'Cause I can't stop it now
It's so amazing how
I know I cant, I could never walk away

How can we resolve this now
We let it go, and wonder how 
This can never be the same
Can never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning while I'm falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you, I'm begging!

'Cause I can't stop it now,
It's so amazing how,
I know I cant, I could never walk away.

Please don't mind what I'm trying to say, 'cause I'm, I'm being honest.
