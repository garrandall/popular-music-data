you can reach but you can't grab it 
you can't hold it control it you can't bag it 
you can push but you can't direct it 
circulate regulate oh no you cannot connect it 

you know you're chewing bubblegum 
you know what that is but you still want some 
you just can't get enough of that lovie dovie stuff 

you get confused but you know it 
yeah you hurt for it woork for it LOVE 
you don't always show it 

LET GO LET'S GO... DISCOTHEQUE 
GO GO... LET GO... DISCOTHEQUE 

looking for the one 
but you know you're somwhere else instead 
you want to be the song 
the song that you hear in your head 

LOVE 

it's not a trick... you can't learn it 
it's the way you don't pay that's okey 'cause you can't earn it 

you know you'e chewing bubblegum 
you know that is but you still want some 
'cause you just can't get enough of that lovie dovie stuff 

LET GO LET'S GO... DISCOTHEQUE 
GO GO... LET GO... DISCOTHEQUE 

looking for the one 
but you know you're somwhere else instead 
I want to be the song 
be the song that you hear in your head 

LOVE 

but you take what you can get 
'cause it's all that you can find 
oh you know there's something more 
but tonight, tonight, tonight 
BOOM CHA 
BOOM CHA 
DISCOTHEQUE 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? 

take these hands they're good for nothing 
you know this hands have never worked a day 
take these boots they're going nowhere 
you know these boots they don't want to stray 
you got my head filled with songs 
you got my shoelaces undone 
take my shirt go on take it off me 
you can tear it up 
if you can tie me down 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED? 

take the colours of my imagination 
take the scent hanging in the air 
take this tangle of a coversation 
and turn it into your own prayer 
with my fingers as you want them 
with my nails in your side 
with my teeth at your back 
and my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED? 

love's a bully pushing shoving 
in the belly of a woman 
heavy rhythm taking over 
to stick together 
a man and a woman 
stick together 
man and woman 
stick together ... 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? 
DO YOU FEEL LOVED? 

and it looks like the sun 
but it feels like the rain 
and there's heat in the sun 
to see us through the rain
