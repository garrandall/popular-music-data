When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all, I had faith in you
I just kept on saying
Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I just kept on saying
Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
You and I, we got a special thing
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
And I'm gonna keep on saying
Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh no, not my baby
Not my babe
Not my baby
Not my sweet baby
Oh no, not my baby
Not my baby
My baby
Not my sweet baby, oh no
