I confess, I messed up
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around
And I know you dressed up
"Hey kid you'll never live this down"

And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with
And I'm just the boy using too many chances

I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"

I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So say what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

Write me off, give up on me
'Cause darling, what did you expect?
I'm just off a lost cause
A long shot, don't even take this bet

You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right

I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"

I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So say what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

Always on
(Always on)
You said you'd keep me honest
Always on
(Always on)
But I won't call you on it
Always on
(Always on)

I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So say what are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
