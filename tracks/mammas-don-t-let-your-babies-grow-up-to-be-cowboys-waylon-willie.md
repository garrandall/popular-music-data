Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold


Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis
And each night begins a new day
And if you don't understand him, and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away


Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love


Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings


Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him


He ain't wrong, he's just different, but his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right


Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love


Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
