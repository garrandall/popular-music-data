Time on my hands
Since you've been away, boy
I ain't got no plans, no no no no
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpane
Is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy


I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down


Sleep don't come easy
Boy, please believe me
Since you've been gone, everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, “Goodbye”?
Look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, oh baby


I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down


Oh, baby love
Goin' down, goin' down
Mmm, I'm goin' down
Oh I, I


I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down


Oh, goin' down, goin' down
Oh, I don't know what to do
If I ever lose you, I'll be goin' down
I said, “I'll be goin' down”
Oh, please forgive me, baby
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
What did I do wrong?
I said, “What did I do wrong?”
Please forgive me, baby, and come on home
Goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down
Mmm
