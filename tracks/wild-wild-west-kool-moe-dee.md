Wild Wild West, Jim West, desperado, rough rider
No you don't want nada
None of this, six-gunning this, brother running this,
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react,
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at,
With Arthemus, from the start of this,
Running the game, James West taming the West so remember the name
Now who ya gonna call?


Not the GBs


Now who you gonna call?


J Dub and AG


If you ever riff with either one of us
Break out, before you get bumrushed at the Wild Wild West
When I roll into the Wild Wild West
When I stroll into the Wild Wild West
When I bounce into the Wild Wild West
Sisqo, Sisqo


We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West


Now, now, now, now once upon a time in the West
Mad man lost his damn mind in the West
Loveless, kidnap a dime, nothin' less
Now I must put his behind to the test
(can you feel me)
Then through the shadows, in the saddle, ready for battle
Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all the riffin' ya did,
Front and center, now where your lip at kid?
Looking at me
Who that is? A mean brother, bad for your health
Looking damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too, ain't trying to hear that
Trying to bring down me, the champion
When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is,
I'm the quickest they is, did I say I'm the slickest they is
So if you barking up the wrong tree we coming, don't be starting nothing
Me and my partner gonna test your chest, Loveless
Can't stand the heat then get out the Wild Wild West


We going straight to (when I roll into the) the Wild Wild West (when I stroll into the)
We going straight to (when I bounce into the) the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West


Can you feel it
Come on
Come on
Keep it moving
Keep it moving


To any outlaw trying to draw, thinking you're bad,
Any draw on West best with a pen and a pad,
Don't even think about it, six gun, weighing a ton,
10 paces and turn (one two three), just for fun, son,
Up 'til sundown, rolling around,
See where the bad guys are to be found and make 'em lay down,
The defenders of the West,
Crushing all pretenders in the West,
Don't mess with us 'cause we're in the Wild Wild West

We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm rolling to the The Wild Wild West
We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm strolling to the The Wild Wild West
We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm bouncing to the The Wild Wild West
We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm rolling to the The Wild Wild West
We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm strolling to the The Wild Wild West
We're going straight to The Wild Wild West
When I'm bouncing to the The Wild Wild West


We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
Come on

Wild Wild West
When I roll into the Wild Wild West
When I stroll into the
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
Wild Wild West
Wild Wild West
Wild Wild West
I done done it again y'all done done it again
Wild Wild West
Wild Wild West Big Will, Dru Hill
Wild Wild West Big Will, Dru Hill
Wild Wild West one time
Bring in the heat, bring in the heat, what?
Wild Wild West
Can't stop the bumrush
The Wild Wild
