Yeah


Welcome to Atlanta, home of them dirty birds
Anybody hatin' get kicked to the curb
Any other team is absurd
Wearing black, white, silver, red is for the Blood
No one scared of getting dirty 'cause we came from the mud
And we hungrier than ever, he rise, she rise
We rise together, birds of a flock
More like birds of a feather
No one here to party until we get the Lombardi
When we giving up? Never
Scratch it off your wishlist, mark it on your calendar
A-town players never play wit' no amateurs
Eighty thou' strong and the fans all screaming
We get knocked down and we coming up swinging
And we putting in work, all done in brotherhood
Yeah, we like family and ATL's motherhood
Brand new home, let the games begin
This season, we back at it again
Luda


Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo


Welcome to Atlanta, where the Falcons play
And we coming for that W like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roaming
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
Welcome to Atlanta, where the Falcons play
And we coming for that W like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roaming
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning


Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And all I'm thinking 'bout is the Superbowl again
But in the meantime, in between time
It's been heavy on my mind since '99
See, I've been putting it down here since '83
Since William Andrews and Bartkowski
When Fulton County stadium was the place to be
If you rep the A-town, then you feel just like me
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules and call me the mayor
Tail-gating in the parking lot, it's like the club
The energy, the brotherhood, everybody rise up
Together, we rise on the rest
And the rest of these guys
The badge of our pride
Around the city, all sides
Brand new home, let the games begin
'Cause this season, we gon' do it again, holla


(Eastside) Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo (Westside)
(Northside) Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo (Southside)
(Eastside) Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo (Westside)
(Northside) Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo (Southside)


Welcome to Atlanta, where the Falcons play
And we going for that W like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roaming
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
Welcome to Atlanta, where the Falcons play
And we going for that W like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roaming
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
