Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?
Skip a rope

Daddy hates mommy, mommy hates dad
Last night you should'a heard the fight they had
It gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?
Skip a rope

Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now what was that they said about a golden rule?
Never mind the rule, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?
Skip a rope

Stab 'em in the back that's the name of the game
And mommy, and daddy, are who's to blame

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Just listen to your children while they play
It's really, not, very funny, what the children say
Skip a rope
Skip a rope
Skip a rope
Skip a rope
