It's Gucci
Fifth Harmony


I need somebody with some patience
'Cause you know I got a temperament
And yeah, you got a reputation
Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kinda situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you
FBI interrogation
I would get up there and lie for you


When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, eyyyy


Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you


You the type that I could bake for (bake for)
'Cause baby, you know how to take that cake
And I'm the only one you wait for
'Cause baby, you know that I'm worth that bake


When push come to shove
You show me love (you show me love)
When push come to shove, eyyyy


Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, (It's Gucci!) down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you


It's like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in
I gangsta and his bride just walked in
We on the same team and we ballin'
Got me showin' off my ring like I'm Jordan
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me
When I was sittin' in the cell is when you showed me
It takes a real one to put her with the old me
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat
That's why we at the game on the floor seats
The diamonds you can see them from the nosebleeds
You make a man, feel like you won a trophy


Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down (love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down (yeah)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (down down down)
Long as you're holding me down, down, down (I'm gon' love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (long as you're lovin' me, boy)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you
