This is my prayer for love
This is my prayer for love, oh lord
Let me fill his life
Full of sunshine and gladness
Never let me bring him
One moment of sadness

This is my prayer, oh lord, oh lord
When trouble comes
Never let him doubt me
Let him feel my love
Around and about him

For this is my prayer, oh lord, oh lord
Yeah, my prayer, oh lord, oh lord

And when I'm old and gray
These are the words I'd like to hear him say
Yes I would, yes I would

Oh oh, darling my life has been completed
You are the only one
That I have ever needed
Oh this is my prayer
My prayer, this is my prayer
Yeah, this is my prayer
Oh lord, this is my prayer
Make him need me, make him want me
Be my lovin' man, oh lord
