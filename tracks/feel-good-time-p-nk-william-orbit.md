(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)



We go where we like
We got over time
We get paid to rattle our chains
We go in the back
Paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed (Untamed)


Now our time, a real good time
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time, a real good time
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time (Said now our time)
A real good time (It’s a really good time)
Baby, you're mine


We know how to pray
Party every day
Make our desolation look plain
Riding in a rut
Till the powers cut
We don’t even have a good name
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed (Untamed)


Now our time, a real good time, ooh
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time, a real good time
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time (Now our time), a real good time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're mine


Doo doo doo doo, baby
Ah, ah, do do do
(Sell me something big and untamed, untamed)


Now are time, a real good time oh
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time (I said now our time)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Real good time (It’s a really good time)
Now our time
Now our time, a real good time


Feel good, real good, it’s the same old saying
Real good, feel good, don’t got no more brains
Feel good, real good, it’s the same old saying, yeah, yeah
Feel good, real good, I don’t got no more brains
Baby, you're mine
