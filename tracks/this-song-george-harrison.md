This song has nothing tricky about it
This song ain't black or white and as far as I know
Don't infringe on anyone's copyright, so...

This song we'll let be
This song is in E
This song is for you and...

This tune has nothing Bright about it
This tune ain't bad or good and come ever what may
My expert tells me it's okay

As this song came to me
Quite unknowingly
This song could be you could be...

This riff ain't trying to win gold medals
This riff ain't hip or square
Well done or rare
May end up one more weight to bear

But this song could well be
A reason to see that
Without you there's no point to... this song
