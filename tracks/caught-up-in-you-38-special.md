I never knew there'd come a day
When I'd be sayin' to you
"Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true."


Don't, don't you know the kind of man I am?
No, said I'd never fall in love again
But it's real, and the feeling comes shining through


I'm so caught up in you, little girl
And I never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
How good it could be


It took so long to change my mind
I thought that love was a game
I played around enough to find
No two are ever the same


You made me realize the love I missed
So hot, love I couldn't quite resist
When it's right, the light just comes shining through


I'm so caught up in you, little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
How good it could be


Fill your days and your nights
No need to ever ask me twice, oh no
Whenever you want me
And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away, oh no
I can't live without you
I'm so caught up in you
Yeah, yeah, yeah


And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away, oh no
I can't live without you


I'm so caught up in you, little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
How good it could be


Little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me and taught me
You got me so caught up in you
