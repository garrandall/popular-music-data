50, Nicole
Itâs just another one
Another number one


Iâm complex, difficult to understand
I donât know if itâs staged
Itâs just to make a better man
I wanna it in the morning
Right early I want it
I rise as the sunrise
Baby now get up on it
Give to me good
Shawty work it like it should
You follow instructions
Then I follow instructions
The ultimate seduction
More kissing and touching
Feels super natural
First chance Iâm at you


Come here baby and be my baby

Me like the way that he push up on me
Me like the way that he goinâ down down down down down

No you never gonna let no girl take him from me
Never gonna let no girl steal him from me
Never gonna let a girl get that close now

Til you feel like you need me
Chest to chest

Come correct to make a sweat
Itâs making us wet
Say my name, say my name
Positions we change
