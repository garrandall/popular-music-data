You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back knockin' on my do'

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

I begged ya not to go but you said, 'Goodbye'
Now you come back tellin' all those lies

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

If you had-a listened long time, ago
You wouldn't be goin' from do' to do'

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been
