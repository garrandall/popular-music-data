WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU
Pat Boone
You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me all alone
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone

CHORUS:
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubled mind

(CHORUS)
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will until I die

(CHORUS)
