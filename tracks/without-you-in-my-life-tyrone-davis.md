Oh, baby

Oh, I, I'm a happy man
But if the day ever came
When I couldn't call out your name
Oh, my life would never be the same
Can you hear me, baby

I swear before God
My life would never be the same

Oh, baby, you see because
Without you, baby
Who made me what I am
And without your love, baby
My life wouldn't be worth a dime

I said without you in my life
It would never be the same
Can you hear me, baby

I swear before God
My life would never be the same

Woo ee, lord, have mercy

Now every man I know
Has something that he loves
And he wouldn't put nothing
In this big wide world above

You see, some men love cars, yeah
Some men love diamond rings
Some men love a whole lotta women
Others love fancy flashy things

But me, if I had just one wish
Ooh, my dear, it would be just this
If I could live for a thousand years
I'd spend all those years with you
Now can you hear me, baby

Cause without you in life
Girl, I just wouldn't know what to do
Now can you hear me, baby

We've been together so long
You been my mother
You been my sister
You been my brother
Oh, you been my father too
