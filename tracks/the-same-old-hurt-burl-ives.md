Got a new house with new lumber
Even got a new phone number
Did it all since we broke apart

Got acquainted with new faces
Started going to new places
But I've got that same old hurt in my heart

Got a new suit for next Sunday
Got a new job starting Monday
Got everybody thinking I'm half smart

Got a new vocabulary
Even got a new canary
But I've got that same old hurt in my heart

No matter what I change
Same old hurt stays the same
Always there reminding me that we're apart

Got a new wallet full of money
Got a new girl that calls me 'Honey'
But I've got that same old hurt in my heart

No matter what I change
Same old hurt, it stays the same
It's always there reminding me that we're apart

Got a new wallet full of money
Got a new girl that calls me 'Honey'
But I've got that same old hurt in my heart

Got that same old hurt in my heart
