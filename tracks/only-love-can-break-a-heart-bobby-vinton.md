Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Last night I hurt you
But, darling, remember this
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

You know I'm sorry
I'll prove it with just one kiss
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Give me a chance to make up
For the harm I've done
Try to forgive me and
Let's keep the two of us one

Please let me hold you and
Love you for always and always
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again
