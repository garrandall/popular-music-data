Well, I've got two lovers,
And I ain't ashamed.
Two lovers, and I love them both the same.

Let me tell you bout, my first lover.
He's sweet and kind, and he's mine, oh, mine, and
Treats me good like a lover should.
And makes me love him.
I really really love him oh, oh, I love him so.
And I'll do everything I can to let him know.

But, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed.
Two lovers, and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you bout my other lover.

Well, you know he treats me bad.
Makes me sad.
Makes me cry, but still I can't deny, but
I love him, I really really love him. oh, oh, I
Love him so. And I'll do everything I can to let him know.

Darlin' well, don't you know I can tell.
That whenever I look at you, that you think
That I'm untrue, 'cause I say that I love two.
But, I really, really do.
Cause, you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.
(They both are you)

Well, I've got two lovers...
