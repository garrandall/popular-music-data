Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon light
A corner bar, an it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
An he walked up, and said: "What'll it be?"
I said: "The good stuff"

He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kinda went misty
He said: "You can't find that here

'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin' so much
An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
An' I smiled and said: "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: "That's my Bonnie
Taken 'bout a year after we were wed"

He said "Spent five years in the bar
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love"
"An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Bein' right there as our time got small
An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He said: "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
An' look into those eyes, so deep in love
An' drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"
