If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life


Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life


Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life


Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you
