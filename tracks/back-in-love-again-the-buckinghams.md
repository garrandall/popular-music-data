Here I am back in love again
And I'm happy that it's not pretend
At last I've found a girl to give my heart a whirl
Someone who's love is from a dream

So here I am back in love again
Thinkin' back I can't remember when
I thought I'd never find, this feeling in my mind
Someone whose love is what it seems

I've been lookin' for someone to love me again
I've been lookin' for someone to love me again

I thought I'd find a girl to give my heart a whirl
Someone who's love is from a dream

I've been lookin' for someone to love me again
I've been lookin' for someone to love me again

I never thought I'd find a girl to make me feel this way
I've only had these envied loves; I've thrown them all away
...
