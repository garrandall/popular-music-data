Jesse James was a lad 
That killed many a man 
He robbed the Glendale train 
He stole from the rich 
And he gave to the poor 
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain 

Well it was Robert Ford 
That dirty little coward 
I wonder now how he feels 
For he ate of Jesse's bread 
And he slept in Jesse's bed 
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave 

Well Jesse had a wife 
To mourn for his life 
Three children 
Now they were brave 
Well that dirty little coward 
That shot Mr. Howard 
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave 

Well now Jesse was a man 
A friend to the poor 
He'd never rob a mother or a child 
There never was a man with 
the law in his hand 
That could take Jesse James when alive 

It was on a Saturday night 
Yeah the moon was 
shinin' bright 
They robbed 
the Glendale train 
And the people they did say 
o'er many miles away 
It was those outlaws yeah Frank 
and Jesse James 

Well Jesse had a wife 
To mourn for his life 
Three children 
Now they were brave 
Well that dirty little coward 
That shot Mr. Howard 
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave 

Now the people held 
their breath 
When they heard of 
Jesse's death 
They wondered how 
he'd ever come to fall 
Robert Ford it was a fact 
He shot Jesse in the back 
While Jesse hung a picture 
on a wall 

Now Jesse went to rest with 
his hand on his breast 
The devil upon his knee 
he was born one day in 
the County Clay 
And he came from 
a solitary race 

Well Jesse had a wife 
To mourn for his life 
Three children 
Now they were brave 
Well that dirty little coward 
That shot Mr. Howard 
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave
