Early one mornin'
While you were asleep
I received a letter
But there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact
I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling
Said open it
It said, "Dear reader
Once close friend of mine
Hope that this letter finds you in time
Cause your love is endin'
And my life's just beginnin'
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you"
And it made me wanna say


I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
I don't ever wanna see you again, no, yeah
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you


It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doin' to me
I wanted to lay down and die
Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
But somehow I knew I had to get over it
He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why


I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
And I don't ever wanna see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you


And you say you love me?
(And you said you love me baby)
Love must've been blind
Cause I sure didn't see this one comin'
(I once was blind but now I see)
My best friend, huh?
They say keep the one's you love close
(Why'd you have to be so low down?)
And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losin', girl
(You were the closest thing to me baby)
Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy
(Knowin' all of the pain you caused me)
Listen to me, baby
I gave you everything
My love and my ring
And you violated me


And I don't wanna see you again
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear (so clear)
And I can move on from here (move on from here)
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby (I'm gonna say a prayer for you baby)
I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see you no more)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you


I don't ever wanna see you again
(Never would be too soon)
But I stuck by you till the end
(I'd rather have a cold day in June)
And my conscience is clear
(So clear)
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
(I need you right now, but...)
I don't ever wanna see you again
(I don't ever wanna see you. You know I don't really need you)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
(You walked around, let me down, feels so good you're not around)
That you were messin' around with
Didn't want to notice it...
