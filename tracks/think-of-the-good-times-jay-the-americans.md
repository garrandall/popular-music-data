You were the only one I could see
Now that we're through, if you think of me
Think of the good times, only the good times
Walks in the rain, warm summer nights
Remember the kisses and not just the fights

One foolish moment drove us apart
If there's a spark still left in your heart
Think of the good times, only the good times
You in my arms, two hearts like one
Don't tell me that it is over and done

Once we promised we'd love forever (way back then)
Can't we let these wonderful memories bring us together again

If you'll admit you think of me yet
Darlin' come back, forgive and forget
Think of the good times, we'll only have good times
Your lips on mine (where they belong)
Where they belong
But this time we won't let our good times go wrong

We'll think of the good times, only the good times
Yeah, we'll think of the good times, only the good times
Oh, we'll think of the good times, only the good times
