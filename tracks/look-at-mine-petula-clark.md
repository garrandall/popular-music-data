Look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine

If you think her eyes are brighter
Look at mine
If you think her lips are softer
Look at mine

If you think her love is stronger
Don't you hang around much longer
Stop awhile, take your time
And get yourself to my place
And look at mine

If you like her dress are better
Look at mine
If she writes you nice love letters
Look at mine

If you think her heart is willing
Don't you wait to make the kiilling
Stop awhile, take your time
And get yourself to my place
And look at mine

Hey, look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine
I've got everything you need
All the time

If you think her smile is sunshine
Look at mine
If you think her looks are so fine
Look at mine

If you think her future's better
Just forget the day you met her
Stop awhile, take your time
And get yourself to my place
And look at mine

Stop awhile, take your time
And get yourself to my place
And look at mine

Why don't you look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine
I've got everything you need
All the time

If you think her smile is sunshine
Look at mine
If you think her looks are so fine
Look at mine

If you think her future's better
Just forget the day you met her
Stop awhile, take your time
And get yourself to my place
And look at mine

Look at mine, look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine
Look at mine, look at mine
Look at mine
