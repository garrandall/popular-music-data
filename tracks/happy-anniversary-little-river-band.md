Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

I'm so happy for you baby
Now that you've found somebody new
I see it in your eyes
Lord, it's no surprise
What he can do for you

But when I look back baby
When I look back to what we had
And I know I'm countin' good times
But there were just as many bad

And so I wish you
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

There's a lesson here to learn
When your baby ups and leaves you
Carry on, don't feel concerned
Even though you're so much in love
You need a little help from above, oh

Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Oh, ain't no foolin' with you baby
Only the words are hard to find
You got me tremblin' at the knees
Answer won't you please
Before I lose my mind

This is our fifth year, baby
And it feels like I'm in jail, Lord
I'm holding on to this card
Can't seem to get it in the mail
And the card reads

Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Oh yeah, happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind
Ah yeah, happy anniversary, baby
Got you on my mind

Oh, have a happy anniversary
'Cause I've got you on my mind
Always on my mind

Happy anniversary
Happy anniversary
