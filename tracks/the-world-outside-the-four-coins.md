Let's hear it for the bar staff, one two three
Because if you're up on your feet, or you're down on your knees
Come rain or shine they give you what you need
So just take my money, just take my money

Let's hear it for the bar staff, one two three
Because if you're up on your feet, or you're down on your knees
Come rain or shine they give you what you need
So just take my money, just take my money

I'm sorry about that time when I rolled in at ten to two
And tried to buy a round of drinks for everyone but you
You rolled your eyes and helped me out, you didn't have to do that
So here's to you and all you do, you wash away the blues

Let's hear it for the bar staff, four five six
Because when the world outside is raining stones and sticks
They take you in and they get you fixed
So just take my money, just take my money

Let's hear it for the bar staff, four five six
Because when the world outside is raining stones and sticks
They take you in and they get you fixed
So just take my money, just take my money

I'm sorry about that time I was completely off my face;
I really should have been at home, not crowding out your space
You sat me down and gave me water, made sure I was safe
So I could pull myself together, live to fight another day

How much do I owe? I guess it's time to go home
I've been sitting at this bar all alone, how much do I owe?
How much does it cost? How much have I lost
Every time that coin gets tossed? How much does it cost?
So won't you ring up my tab, maybe call me a cab
You know I'll be back, next time things get bad
Because you know how it goes â everybody gets low
How much do I owe?
How much do I owe?

Let's hear it for the bar staff â roll them a seven!
You pulled me out of hell, you guys are going to heaven
So pour another round and let's sing it again:
Let's hear it for the bar staff, eight nine ten

Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
Let's hear it for the bar staff
