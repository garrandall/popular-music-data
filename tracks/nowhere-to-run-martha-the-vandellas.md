Nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide

It's not love I'm runnin' from
Just the heartbreak I know will come
'Cause I know you're no good for me (you're no good)
But you've become a part of me

Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah

Nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be, no

Each night as I sleep, into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon, that I'll forget you

When I look in the mirror, to comb my hair
I see your face just a-smilin' there

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, from you baby
I got nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me

How can I fight a love, that shouldn't be?
When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me

My love reaches so high, I can't get over it
It's so wide, I can't get around it, no

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide from you babe
Just can't get away from you baby, no matter how I try

I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be

Nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide (nowhere to hide)
Got nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide (nowhere to hide)
