Baby, oh baby
I love to call you baby
Baby, oh, oh baby
I love for you to call me baby

When you squeeze me real tight
You make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you

Baby, oh baby
You look so good to me baby
Baby, oh baby
You are so good to me baby

Just one look in your eye
And my temperature goes sky high
I live for you and can't help it
You know I really don't want to help it

B A B Y, baby
B A B Y, baby

Whenever the sun don't shine
You go out to light my hind
Then I get real close to you
And your sweet kisses see me through

I said baby, oh baby
You look so good to me baby
Baby, oh baby
How I love for you to call me baby

When you squeeze me real tight
You know you make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you

B A B Y, baby
