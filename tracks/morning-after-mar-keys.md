Yeah, its always been dane
Always the same
All about the same girl and the same pain
Now I got two girls with the same name
Wait, I'm feelin' myself
See it's been a whole week
And i can't even tell
Right between goin' to heaven or going to hell
Feel like I'm stuck in a cell
Told me I'm sellin' soul
Are you sellin' yourself
I feel like I'm walkin' on shells
What should I tell, I feel like Adele
Feel like my hands in the air is the way that they want me
Stay quiet and keep to yourself
Maybe we're livin' in hell
Maybe it's all in our minds, or all a matter of time
You have no vision, you're blind
An lately I'm losin' myself
Now I'm harder to find
I feel like I'm stuck in a bine
Feel like I'm stuck in a vine
Loopin' a day at a time
Wake up you're workin' at nine
Why are we told never get out of line
And why would I think you would ever be mine
You never gave me a sign
And now you're the one that I'm leavin' behind
Runnin' from something that's bigger than I
I'm, so sick of nothin'
Wanna be somethin
Sausage McMuffin
Just to ease the pain this morning while my stomachs rumbly
Minimum wage
Another day that I can't pay
Nothings stuck in fuckin' gray
You eat gourmet I microwave oven
Runnin' you're stuck on a leash
Wanna see Spain, and I wanna see Greece
Wanna see things I would never believe
I wanna wake up with a view of the sea
I wanna believe, I wanna achieve
I wanna perceive everythin' I could be
Perceiving is key
We are what we see
And lately I've been in this rut
Now I wanna be, free


I don't wanna hold back for you
Put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know whats after you
Who's after you, who knows
Lose myself chasin' after you, I
Only ever got half of you, I
I don't know whats after you
Who's after you, who knows and who cares
Cause I'm run run I'm running from here
You're watching me run run I'm running from here
You're watching me run run I'm running from here
I'm running from here
I'm running from here
Oh, no no no no no

I guess what I wanna say is I feel stuck
I do like a girl with a big butt
I either don't drink or get too drunk
And pass our on my best friends futon
I need to move on from this basic shit
I wake up, eat and go and take a piss
You do somethin' fun and have to take a pic
And really life is a movie
Go and make a flick
You gotta make a pick
You gotta take a chance
Can't see the world when it's in your hands
And when I first started it was Ty and Dan
Now it's still us, plus a couple fans
I've been stressin' and I've been workin' hard
Hard is not enough when you regard a star
Been shootin' far only hittin' mars
There is more to life than just girls in bars
There is more to life than just gettin' by
Now you drink the pain so you can chase the high
When they say you can't, you gotta question why
You will never understand my plan to drive, damn
Still stuck in this town
Think of the lights while I'm ridin' around
I focus on me I don't care who you found
I'm coming for king only thing is the crown
I'm tired of feelin' so down
They say that I'll make it as soon as I'm found
But fuck being found
I stuck to my morals and ground
I care about my passion, my heart and my sound
I care about the people here holdin' it down
My ex was a mess who was messin' around
Ignorin' your texts you're irrelevant now
It's over and now imma run 'til I'm found



No time to wait
Runnin' from somethin' I'm tired of safe
I wanna be someone you never replace
I only see pain when I stare at my face and
Damn, open your eyes
Open your heart
Open your mind
You're taking your time
You're taking too long
They're gonna forget you without a new song
It's, kinda funny how the game works
Talk about money bitches get paid dirt
And we all end up in the same hearse
So your legacy is really what makes worth
And, I don't wanna be stuck in this loop
Complacent and basic is how you will lose
We're standin' for somethin' we're able to choose
And honestly, Mark, I've been runnin' from you
