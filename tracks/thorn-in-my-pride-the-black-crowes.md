Wake me when the day breaks
Show me how the sun shines
Tell me about your heartaches
Who could be so unkind?
Do you dream to touch me?
And smile down deep inside
Or could you just kill me?
Hey, it's hard to make up your mind sometimes.

My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride
My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride

Are you wanting inspiration?
You spill your secrets on me
Then you tell me with a whisper
Of things that will never be.
Do you hear me breathing?
Does it make you want to scream?
Did you ever like a bad dream?
Sometimes life is obscene.

My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride
My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride
My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride

Lover, cover me with your sleep
Let your love light shine, let it shine
Lover, cover me with a good dream
Oh, let your love light
Oh, let your love light shine

Oh, I wanna know, do you ever wanna let it shine?
Do you ever wanna let it shine, baby?
Your love light, your love light
Listen, lover, cover me with your sleep
Let your love light shine, let it shine

Lover, cover me with your sleep
Let your love light shine, let it shine
Lover, cover me with your dream
Let your love light shine, let it shine

Thorn in my pride
