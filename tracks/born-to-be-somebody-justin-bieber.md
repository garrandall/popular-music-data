There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set free

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it, I can taste it
Change is, coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall

I'm going all the way
I can feel it, I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Feel it
Believe it
Dream it
Be it

I was born to be somebody (born to be, yeah!)
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me (no, no, woah)
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Oh, oh
And this world will belong to me
Yeah, yeah, oh
This world will belong to me
