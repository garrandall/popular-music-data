Something 'bout the way she’s wearing her dress a little tighter
Something 'bout the way she’s starin', she’s lookin' to start a fire
Something 'bout the way she’s dancin' and drinkin' chill Patron
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

Something 'bout the way she’s blushin' you can tell she isn’t sure
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

If I had a woman like that
Man I’d let her know
I’d hold her tight
I’d hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She’d never ever be alone


Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, Lord if she’s lonely now
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long
