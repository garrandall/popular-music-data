(Cindy's gonna cry)
(Cindy's gonna cry)

I know that Cindy's gonna cry
When I tell her that
I don't love her anymore

I know she'll find it hard to speak
As the tears roll down her cheek
And I'll feel like running out the door

I know that Cindy's gonna cry
When I ask her to give back
The ring she's had so long

And when she puts it in my hand
I know every speech I've planned
Will come out sounding all wrong

My Cindy gave so much to me
And she loved so faithfully
Oh, I never meant to hurt her so

But although she's not to blame
Somehow I don't feel the same
So I've got to let her go

I know that Cindy's gonna cry
When I tell her that
I may cry a little too

But I just gotta face it now
And I'll see it through somehow
Cause though Cindy's gonna cry
I just can't help loving you

But I just gotta face it now
And I'll see it through somehow
Cause though Cindy's gonna cry
I just can't help loving you

(Cindy's gonna cry)
(Cindy's gonna cry)
(Cindy's gonna cry)
