Freak-A-Zoids, robots, please report
Freak-A-Zoids, robots, please report to the dance floor
Z-O-I-D-S, Z-O-I-D-S, Freak-A-Zoid
Z-O-I-D-S, Z-O-I-D-S, rock baby
Dance

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up

Kick up your heels
Baby, relax your mind
Leave all your worries to me
‘Cause I am programmed to take care of you
And all of your physical needs
You see…

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up, Oh dare scream
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up

Shake your body like you just don’t care
I said, oh baby, I can be your Freak-A-Zoid if you dare
I said, shake your body like you just don’t care
I said, I can be your Freak-A-Zoid if you dare
I spell Z-O-I-D-S, Z-O-I-D-S, rock baby

So baby come here, let me satisfy you
I just know what you need
I never get tired, I’m rechargeable
My senses are ready to please, you see

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up, Oh dare scream
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up

I am now in total automation
You every wish is my command
Take me to your dance floor

(Freak… a…)

We are Midnight Star
We’re gonna show you how to do it, yes we are
We’re got Freak-A-Zoids, robots, and asteroids
They won’t stop, don’t stop, rocking the floor
They say…

Female: (Oh, hello, and what’s that you’re doing?)
Male: (The Freak-A-Zoid)
Female: (The Freak-A-Zoid? How do you spell it?)
Male: (Z-O-I-D-S)
Female: (Z-O-I-D-S. Zoids?)
Male: (Freak-A-Zoids!)
Female: (OH! BY CHIP, I THINK I’VE GOT IT!)

Rock baby
Z-O-I-D-S, Z-O-I-D-S, rock baby

Z-O-I-D-S, Z-O-I-D-S, rock baby

Dance

They say that we don’t like that rock and trouble
I’m gonna rock you, if I’m not old
I said
The little kiddies, they like what I do
I’m gonna make them party until the midnight dew
I said

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up

Shake your body like you just don’t care
I said, I can be your Freak-A-Zoid if you dare
I said, shake your body like you just don’t care
I said, I can be your Freak-A-Zoid if you dare

(Freak… Freak…)

Midnight Star
Makes our
Freak-A-Zoids
Robots
Asteroids
It makes really me hard
Makes me hard
Makes me hard, to the dance floor

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up, Oh dare scream
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up

I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up, Oh dare scream
I’ll be your Freak-A-Zoid
Come on and wind me up
