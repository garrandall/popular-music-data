Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own

Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy with it (Oh
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)
Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
'Cause I am right so I gots to win (Uh, uh, uh)
Break bread with the enemy (Fuck)
But no matter how many cats I break bread with
I'll break who you sendin' me (Yeah)
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing (Uh, uh, uh)
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day (Give up)
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said "Freeze!" (Uh)
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!


First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!

X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya


Ain't never gave nothing to me (Yeah)
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin' somethin' from me (Uh, huh)
I ain't got it, so you can't get it (Yeah)
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't with it (Yeah)
Hit it with full strength (Fuck)
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothin' (Fuck)
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doin' this for 19 years (Fuck)
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears (Fuck)
I put in work, and it's all for the kids (Uh)
But these cats done forgot what work is (Uh, huh)
They don't know who we be, looking
But they don't know who they see, nigga


First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya (Come on)
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go! (Come on)
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya


Ay yo, where my niggas at?! I know I got them down in the game, give 'em love and they give it back (Oh
Talk too much for too long (What?)
Don't give up, you're too strong (What?)
Dub to the wild wild hunneds (Yeah)
Shout out to niggas that done it (Come on)
And it ain't even about the dough (Uh, uh, uh)
It's about getting down for what you stand for, yo, for real!


First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go! (Come on)
