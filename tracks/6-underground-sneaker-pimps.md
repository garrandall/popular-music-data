(A one, two)

Take me down, 
6 underground, the ground beneath your feet (A one, two)
Laid out low
Not meant to go
No where or way to meet (A one, two)
I've got a head full of drought
Down here
So far off from losing out
Round here
Overground
Watch this space
I'm open...to falling from grace

Calm me down
Bring it round
To way high off your street (A one, two)
I can see
Like nothing else
In me you're better than I wanna be
Don't think cuz I understand
I care
Don't think cuz I'm talkin'
We're friends
Overground
Watch this space
I'm open...to falling from grace

Talk me down
Safe and sound
Too strung up to sleep (A one, two)
Wear me out
Scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap (A one, two)
I fake my life like I bleed
Too much
I'll take whatever you're givin'
Not enough
Overground
Watch this space
I'm open
I fake my life like I've lived
Too much
I'll take whatever you're givin'
Not enough
Overground
Watch this space
I'm open...to falling from grace

(A one, two)
(A one, two)
(A one, two)
(A one, two)
