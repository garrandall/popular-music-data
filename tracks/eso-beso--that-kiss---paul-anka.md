Mmm, eso beso, ooh that kiss 
Aah, eso beso, ooh your kiss 
It's got something, don't know what 
But whatever it's got, it's got a lot 

When we samba (the bossanova) 
Close like this (the bossanova) 
Ay, ay caramba (the bossanova) 
Who unleashed that kissÂ  (the bossanova) 
Hold me closer and we'll soar 
For the samba's the quickest way to make amor 

As we dip and sway and caress this way 
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay" 
Like the samba sound, my heart begins to pound 
I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco 

Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh that kiss (the bossanova) 
Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh your kiss (the bossanova) 
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar 
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore 

As we dip and sway we caress this way 
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay" 
Like that samba sound, my heart begins to pound 
And I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco 

Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh your kiss (the bossanova) 
Kiss me mucho (the bossanova) I love your kiss (the bossanova) 
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar 
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore 

Ah this dance (the bossanova) 
Ooh, romance (the bossanova) 
I love that kiss (the bossanova) 
Kiss me mucho (the bossanova) 


A little more mucho (the bossanova) 
Then we'll dance 
Ah that kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss 
Mucho, mucho, mucho
