When you fell and skinned your knees
By jumping fences, climbing trees
I used to laugh and call you tomboy

You'd run across the meadow
While the sun would chase your shadow
In those carefree days

Freckle faced and April tan
You always seemed to understand
What daffodils were saying, tomboy

I watched you, thinking I'll be smart
And in a while, she'll start to
Change her ways

But then I went away
And I got hurt pretty bad
They sent me home
And it's too bad they bad

Cause just outside my window
I can see the lovely lady
Who two short years ago
Was just a kid

A car drives up
You greet your date
And then I sit up awful late
Until you're safely home
My tomboy

You kissed that boy
I turned my head
And wheel myself back to my bed
While teardrops flow

Sometimes you come to visit me
But I don't want your sympathy
It's only you I want, my tomboy

But I won't spoil your happiness
So I'll make sure you never guess
I love you so

Sometimes you come to visit me
But I don't want your sympathy
It's only you I want, my tomboy

But I won't spoil your happiness
So I'll make sure you never guess
I love you so

When you fell and skinned your knees
By jumping fences, climbing trees
I used to laugh and call you tomboy

You'd run across the meadow
While the sun would chase your shadow
In those carefree days
