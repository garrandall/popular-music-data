Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talkin' crazy, sayin' that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo
I'mma do it acapella, yeah

Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said, "Get a rich boyfriend,
You don't gotta love 'em, girl, you can pretend."
You bet I totes believed her, yeah, every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread
Mama always said, "Nice guys finish last.
Beat him at his own game, honey, take the cash."

Oh, and what a lucky girl you will be
But no, he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk

Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo
I'mma do it acapella, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'mma do it acapella, yeah

Out on our first date, he took me gourmet
We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy
Daddy always said, "Let the gentleman pay.
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet."
I saw his bad intention, he didn't wanna talk
He put the saucy on it (Oops!) time to check my watch
Daddy always said, "Money can't buy class.
You don't wanna get stuck takin' out trash."

Oh, and yeah I guess it wasn't meant to be
Because he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk

Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo
I'mma do it acapella

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'mma do it acapella
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me do it in falsetto
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Never mind, bring the beat back

Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went fallin' out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talkin' crazy sayin' that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo
I'mma do it acapella
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'mma do it acapella, yeah
