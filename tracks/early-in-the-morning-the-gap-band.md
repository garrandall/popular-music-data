Oh, I never, you know I loved you till you left me
Oh, I never, you know I cared till you were gone
I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I lost you till you're gone
Oh, I never, knew I loved you till you were gone

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
Gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

Now I gotta get up early every morning
'Cause the early bird always catches the worm
Now I gotta get up every morning
Gotta make up for the lesson I've learned
Gotta find me a lover that won't run for cover
Gotta find me a lover that won't run the mother

'Cause I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I lost you till you're gone
She had a pretty face that drove me wild
I even wanted her to have my child

Early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

(Team say it)
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover

(Ladies just sing it one time, sing ladies)
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover

Early in the mornin'
In the middle of the day, baby
Late at night, mama
Everything gonna be all right

Early in the mornin'
In the middle of the day, baby
Late at night, baby
Everything will be all right

Early in the mornin'
In the middle of the day, baby
Late at night, baby
Everything will be all right

Early in the mornin', baby
In the middle of the day, baby
Late at night, mama
Everything will gonna be all right, yeah

Early in the mornin', baby
In the middle of the day, baby
Late at night, mama
Everything will gonna be all right
