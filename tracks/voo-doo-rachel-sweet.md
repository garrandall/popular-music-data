Close your eyes baby, make a wish
Wanna try, wanna try
You love the power 'cause I'm flying high
Flying high

Cast a spell
Can you read my mind
Are you surprised
At what you find?

So don't ask me to dance, voodoo
'Cause I'm caught in your magic spell
It's such a spooky romance, voodoo
You can tell little honey, who can tell? Voodoo
That you do so well

Close your eyes baby, make a wish
Do you think of me, think of me
You've got the power
Got control of me, mentally, totally

Cast a spell
Can you read my mind
Are you surprised
At what you find?

So don't ask me to dance, voodoo
'Cause I'm caught in your magic spell
It's such a spooky romance, voodoo
You can tell little honey, who can tell?
Voodoo that you do so well, with the voodoo that you do so well

Hold me in the shadow, touch me in the night
Something wrong, We'll never feel so right
Wait for you

So don't ask me to dance, voodoo
'Cause I'm caught in your magic spell
It's such a spooky romance, voodoo
You can tell little honey, who can tell?

So don't ask me to dance, voodoo
'Cause I'm caught in your magic spell
It's such a spooky romance, voodoo
You can tell little honey, who can tell? Voodoo
