Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, itâs one more day for progress
And we canât slow down âcause more is best
Itâs all an endless process


(Well) I miss Mayberry
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke
Where everything is black and white
Picking on a six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
Bye, bye

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting
Through the trees as the wind blows
Thatâs when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through Godâs window
Now I canât fly
But I got two feet that get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear




Sometimes I dream Iâm driving down an old dirt road
Not even listed on a map
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back



Bye, bye
I miss Mayberry, I miss Mayberry
