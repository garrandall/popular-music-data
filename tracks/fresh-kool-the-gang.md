Conversation is going 'round
People talking 'bout the girl who's come to town
Lovely lady, pretty as can be
No one knows her name she's just a mystery

I have seen her maybe once or twice
The one thing I can say is, she's very nice
She's a lady, one I really want to know
Somehow I've got to let my feeling show

She's fresh, exciting
She's so exciting to me
She's fresh, exciting
She's so inviting to me, yeah

I've been thinking about the way you walk
Baby, I like the way you talk
Tell you something I really can't hide
Heaven must have sent you to be by my side

Fresh and lovely like a dream come true
I'll give anything to spend the night with you
What a feeling and I can't stop it baby
Miss frisky lady take me away

She's fresh, exciting
She's so exciting to me, yeah
She's fresh, exciting
So inviting to me, yeah

Fresh as a summer breeze
She'll take you by surprise
She means so much to me
I'll do whatever to make her mine, baby
Oh yeah

She's fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh

Fresh as a summer breeze
She means so much to me, yeah
I want to take her by the hand
And pray she'll understand

'Cause I love the way she walks
And oh baby, I love the way she talks
I've got something and I hope she'll understand
Miss frisky lady, oh

Sheis so fresh and I love that lady,
Oh, how I love 'em so, yeah

She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's so fresh, she's so fresh
She's so fresh
