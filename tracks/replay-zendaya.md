Make it stop
Sound so good I just can't take no more
Turn it down, turn it up
I don't know, I don't know (know)
But don't stop, don't move
Just keep it there (right there)
Keep it right there, keep it right there

I wanna put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you everywhere I go


Yeah
Wanna put this song on replay,
I can listen to it all day,
I can listen to you all day,
Hear you all day
Yeah
Wanna put this song on replay,
We can start all over again and again, yeah
Wanna put this song on replay


Don't stop,
Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder
I don't wanna miss a single thing,
I wanna hear every melody, yeah.
B-b-b-b-beating, beating,
Beating so loud, you can feel it (feel it)
B-b-b-b-beating, beating, beating
Beating for you

I wanna put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat, play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go, play you everywhere I go




Feel it all, feel it all crashing down (down, down)
I'm so lost, I'm so lost in your sound
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay (put this song on replay) on replay
Lis-listen to you all day, to you all day!



Yeah
