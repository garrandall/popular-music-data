I saw a man today who said he'd talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time I prayed
Oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago


Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago


I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy
And so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago


Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know, I've tried since fifteen years ago
