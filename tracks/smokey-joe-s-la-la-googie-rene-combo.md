Miscellaneous
Joe's Gonna Die
They got Chris, they got Aaron.
It looks like Umbrella's done it again.
Cuz this time it ain't in Raccoon City,
This time it's in Kokomo, and it's happening to me.
Somebody help me.
Kill the zombies
Before they destroy the town.
Kill the zombies
They're chasing me all around.
Kill the zombies
Before they take us all down.
Kill the zombies.
What am I supposed to do?
Everyone's got the virus.
Chris Retfield, where are you?
Help me overcome this.
Dead dogs are chasing me,
And so are giant spiders.
This evil nightmare just can't be.
Here come the hunters.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Everyone's dead, I'm the only one still alive.
I feel the lickers, they're on my tail.
Oh, God, save me from this hell.
Somebody help me.
Kill the zombies
Before they destroy the town.
Kill the zombies
They're chasing me all around.
Kill the zombies
Before they take us all down.
Kill the zombies.
I run down a dark alley
To escape the monsters.
I hear them coming after me.
Now they've got me cornered.
This can't be happening,
It's unbelievable
Won't someone please save me
From this Resident Evil?
