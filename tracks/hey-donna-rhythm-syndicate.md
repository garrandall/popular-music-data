Hey Donna
Rhythm Syndicate
(Sturken/Rogers)

Yeah!
Listen up

First time I saw you
You were different than the rest
The way you walked into the room
The way you wore that dress
I did everything to impress you
Trying all my favorite lines
But you looked into my eyes and
Cut me down to size
Said you don't play for keeps
Then don't waste my time

Hey Donna
Why you wanna do me like that
Why do me like that
Stole my heart and you won't give it back
Give it back
Donna, Donna, Donna

I can't take it no more
Took you out to dinner
And I treated you so right
But when I took you for a ride
You said Baby not tonight
What do have I to say
To make you mine
I can't take this living on a dream
You got me on the run
You're so fine
You make it hurt so good
I just gotta scream

Hey Donna
Why you wanna do me like that
Why do me like that
Hey Donna
Loving you is the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had

Hey Donna
Why you wanna do me like that
Everytime you smile
Girl it drives me wild
Hey Donna
Stole my heart and you won't give it back
Hey Donna
Why
Locked it up and threw away the key
Don't you know you oughta be with me

Best I ever had

That look in your eyes
Just gotta say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey Donna why?
