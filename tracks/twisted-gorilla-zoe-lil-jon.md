In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted 

Ok, let's go, Shawty got her hands on ground and her ass' on my face 
Don't tell her my boy dranks on the face list, do another round but to buy another case 
Why in a rush? Say what you mama givin? Maybe wanna meet your mama 
Yah, got me through her money, baby girl there's rhumba 
we can have a samba party, hardy, drinks .. 

Girl your ass is memorable, you should be a center fold 
got me stuck, I'm so caught up, on how to .. no tits girl 
.. remind your ass how fine it is, tell your man how blind he is 
bet that's is on rewinding shit, dj might of rewind this shit 

Dance, shake what's in your pants do it with no harm 
In the 3 point stop, dj out of control, .. re roll 
no stop and let's go, put your hands on the floor, put your hands on the floor 

In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted 

We getting twisted in the club, you tell me what's in your car 
We got bottles off the bar, you got .. roll it up, you got cash then throw a stack 
you got hands then throw it back, we got rose motel 
getting twisted that's so .. 
we can throw a couple 2 more nose that just might rub us 
tell a ..friend we just might do it, you nasty girl, you look like .. 
..like supper, wake up in the morning, ..on the liquor, I was drunker than a .. 

Dance, shake what's in your .. do it with no harm 
In the 3 point stop, dj out of control, .. re roll 
no stop and let's go, put your hands on the floor, put your hands on the floor 

In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted 
In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me 
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted, let's go, let's go.
