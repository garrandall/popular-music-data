Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light, those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne, you don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money, you don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Put on the red light, put on the red light
Put on the red light well, put on the red light
Well, put on the red light, oh

I loved you since I knew you, I wouldn't talk down to you
I have to tell you just how I feel, I won't share you with another boy
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light

You don't have to put on the red light, Roxanne, put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Put on the red light, put on the red light
Put on the red light well, put on the red light
