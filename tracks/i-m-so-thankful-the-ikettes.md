You're the one I
Met in skies of gray
And you're the one who
Chased the clouds away

I thought that I would
Never find a love all mine
And for this, I'm so thankful
For this, I'm so thankful to you

Thank you, baby
Ooh, thank you, baby
Ooh, baby

You're the flame
Who set my soul on fire
I'm proud to have a
Love that you inspire

And when we walk together
Hand in hand, understand
For this, I'm so thankful
For this, I'm so thankful to you

Thank you, baby
Ooh, thank you, baby

I used to think
That I could be your queen
And have the things
That only money brings

But I have more than
All that gold can buy
That is why, for this
I'm so thankful
For this, I'm thankful

For this, I'm thankful
Ooh, every day now
Ooh, every minute
