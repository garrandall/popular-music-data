Young, sad, and blue
'Cause we're through
And no one's gonna want you, boy
Young, sad, and blue
'Cause we're through
And no one's gonna want you, boy


Hate to sound sad and blue
Because I'm actually elated
That I'm getting rid of you
No more crank calls on my telephone
Random chickenheads
Asking me, baby, if you've come home


Wandering eyes, endless lies
Bottomless pits of your bullshit
Making me cry
Things that aren't true
Patience for you
I gotta say goodbye to all this pain
I hope I never see your face again
Because I'm




I used to trip off your chest and pretty smile
But now I see your true self
For what you really are
Your sex was just tactics
For things you couldn't do
And now that we're not together
I don't have to fake it through
