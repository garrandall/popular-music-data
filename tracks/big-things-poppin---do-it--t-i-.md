Hey, hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, 'cause I'ma do it, 'cause I'ma do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it

Now lemme hear you say
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Ball on these suckers, shawty, losin' is not an option

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, 'cause I'ma do it, 'cause I'ma do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now lemme hear you say
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Ball on these suckers, shawty, losin' is not an option

Now do it to the maximum, take it why you askin' 'em?
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational
See I said I was "King" and them lames started laughin'
Same sucker now want the King on a track with 'em

I composed several classicals, you know like "Top Back"
"Dope Boy", "Bring 'Em Out", and "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I'ma top, what you know about that?
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back (Do it)

See me raise hell, at a show just like that
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that"
Yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail

I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slangin' in the chair
I will slang, no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale

Let's do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, 'cause I'ma do it, 'cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now lemme hear you say
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Ball on these suckers, shawty, losin' is not an option

Now I do it like a ball player, when you see me ballin'?
Stacks tall as ball players, from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati, or the Riverdale
Arizona, California, I make it rain anywhere

Pullin' out in public shawty who you think you finna scare?
I send a missiles at you have you going in your underwear
I tote a pair of 40's on me, so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it's goin' down

A-Town, West Side, club you should catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lyin', said they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm something like a stalker, I be everywhere the strap be

The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it, I could get a 100 on a tab
Sell 'em all, double down, do the math
Think I won't pull up in something with 200 on the dash?

Yeah I do it, you better do it, you better do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, 'cause I'ma do it, 'cause I'ma do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Ball on these suckers, shawty, losin' is not an option

Now I do it like I wanna do it, I do it right in front of you
Real, vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my partner Phil daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and they grandmama too

Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want cause she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and it's you I bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two

I do it for my partners, gon' make sure them, stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers, ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pops and my cousin too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these rappers copy me?
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it this good and do it different
No matter what I do you know I do it to death

Hey I'ma do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, 'cause I'ma do it, 'cause I'ma do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now lemme hear you say
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and lil' things stoppin'
Ball on these suckers, shawty, losin' is not an option
Now do it
