Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame?
You say
One love, one life
It's one need
In the night
One love
We get to share it
Leaves you, darling
You don't care for it
Mary

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well, it's too late
Tonight
To drag your past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One... one

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head?
Well did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing
That was all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
Simply, hurt each other
Then we do it again

You said
Love is a temple
Love is a higher law
Love is a temple
Love is a higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life you got
To do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters
And my brothers
One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One... one
One... one
One, one love, one lov
