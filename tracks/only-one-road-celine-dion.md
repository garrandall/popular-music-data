I'm looking back through the years
Down this highway
Memories,
They all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will

When love was too much to bear
I just left it there

Here I stand face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time
I never realized

And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around

There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back,
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said "Goodbye" but our hearts did not hear
Now, my love, there's nothing left to fear

With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you

There is only one road I'm walking
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walking
But I'm gonna run back,
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

There is only one road I'm walking
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walking
But I'm gonna run back,
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

'Cause I'm gonna run back,
I'm gonna run back
'Cause, baby, I need you right here
Beside me
