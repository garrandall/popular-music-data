Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
With you, I felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over but you just can't get over

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closin' time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they'll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you'd never feel again

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishin' you were with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closin' time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Yeah (yeah)

Oh, girl, this is for the best friend
But this girl meets boy, girl don't make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hm hm
You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you're goin' through, I do

So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishin' you were with somebody
'Cause you don't wanna go home when it's closing time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain't ever been broke
The kind of lips that get your eyes to close
I know just what you're goin' through
'Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
I wanna kiss somebody
