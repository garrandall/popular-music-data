Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
(Wasted)
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Ha, rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking

Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send 20 more cases

Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie but it's on like Jimy X
Pill poppers geeked up krazy whole click rolling
Everyone wasted purple codine sprite

Pink don't wasted, mix up, grandma drunk it
Then taste it, now grandma sipping syrup
Leaning wasted walking 'round fuck up
Twisting her finga home gurl

Slipped up drunk got wasted now
She back stage an she tryna get famous
Hit me up the drinky, drinky Gucci Mane
Shake it, club night, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking

Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send 20 more cases

I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck dis almond joy
Said she gotta stop sucking 'cause her jaw's sore

Gotta bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Party just popping up but now he rolling more
Rolled on, 3 pills now, he on 4 idk, why?
But that remy turned into a whore

Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got the 40 on my waist and it's off safety
'Bout 40 goons wit me and we all wasted
Only remy straight tonight dawg no chasing

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking

Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send 20 more cases

Only click faded we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelet we white boy wasted
No shirt, fuck it unless your arms tatted
We slapping trunk disgusted the liquor

Keep wasting 285 east side me and Plies wasted
Racing seven big booty broads chasing spring break
50 thousand white girls shake it some dancing naked
But everyone wasted magic city Monday

Ball players wasted this one for yo' uncle
Drinking Thunderbird wasted 12 pack wasted
I need more cases and Gucci not a racist
All my diamonds Caucasians

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking

Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send 20 more cases

This has been a GPSA
Ghetto public service announcement
We don't get fucked up no more, we get wasted
Gucci Mane, Plies, Fat Boi, wasted
