You walked in to the room
I just had to laugh
The face you wore was cool
You were a photograph


When it's all too late
It's all too late


I did not have the time
I did not have the nerve
To ask you how you feel
Is this what you deserve?


When it's all too late
It's all too late


Change
You can change
Change
You can change


And something on your mind
Became a point of view
I lost your honesty
You lost the life in you


When it's all too late
It's all too late


We walk and talk in time
I walk and talk in two
Where does the end of me
Become the start of you?


When it's all too late
It's all too late


Change
You can change
Change
You can change


What has happened to
The friend that I once knew?
Has he gone away?

When it's all too late
It's all too late
Change


Change
You can change
Change
You can change


Change
You can change
Change
You can change


Change
You can change
Change
You can change
