Too bad what's happened to our good love
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
We have to hurt sometime, this is my first time
The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
And the last word in lonesome is me
