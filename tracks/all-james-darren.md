Yeh, Stop Me
Stop Me
Stop Me

At the forefront of all of these people I front for
She might have found a reason to walk out the front door
There's not enough hindsight to see what comes after
And 20/20 tells me this is only one chapter

I see you standing in the intersection
Dodging the traffic in your direction
But I'm bout to hit you with these confessions
You can't have love without affection

Even with evil with me wasn't just an expression
Nah, School of Roses, I'm still learning my lesson
Now my career's not a rearview mirror
Cause everything that I see is smaller than it appears

I wanna, make art, make love and not war
The ceilings too high and I can't find the floor
We said we'd be together to glorify the Lord
So Blue's wondering what the goodbyes are for

Stop me, stop me, oh somebody stop me
We'll both have a lemonade on the rocks please
My main squeeze, I never meant to be cocky
We're moving so fast, let's keep it at God speed

Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong, then please stop me

I think it's time for me to turn the mirror around
Everything that I see is looking different now
New start, Broussard had to break it down
Made it on SportsCenter Darren, you can take a bow

Oh God, I hear Jesus on a Honda ad?
While I'm watching King James bring Ohio back
From the 'Bus to the 'Land we got plans
And nobody's worried about Kevin Durant

I'm from the home of the Macho Man, I'm so savage
Waiting on my Miss Elizabeth to help me manage
Oh Yeah, wanna see'm buck wild
The way they smile when they see AJ Styles

This song's the serenade when LeBron hits the stage
I'm ballin' with the Rock, Brahma bullin' like Dwyane
Touch down in the D with Osteen and Sway
I'd rather be alone then to change from Unashamed so

Stop me, stop me, oh somebody stop me
This startin' to feel like the theme song from Rocky
The world loosin' they minds, we gettin sloppy
I'm followin Your creed, the devil is tryin to box me
(Keep tryin yo)

Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong, then please...

JGivens

(Check)

She asked what my greatest fear (fear) was (was) to my ear buds, clear drugs controlling a beer buzz
What if career cheer doesn't color fast enough to hear plus, what if Jehovah just couldn't hear enough

Shed blood (blood) our mama's
What if He was never to reappear cause, cause blood just wasn't enough, Wes (Wes) in that puddle of mud, I hope it's clearin up

Get up, I get down fist pound on the microphone, it sounds like xylophones to tear ducts, make a ear duck, if it's over ya head, look, open your headlights, highway, deer, bus crash site

Ignorantro'll go a year just add another year half life, cue the bag pipes
Light a candle like a flashlight, write his handle on the mantle of the beast of humble's past life

Stop Me, and oh, nobody drop me
Two by two, they just sold out the Roxy
Face in hand, but time is how a clock see

Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
Oh... Stop Me
Keep praying for us in proxy
