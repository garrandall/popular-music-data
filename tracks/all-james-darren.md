All the words I can recall
Could never capture all
The loveliness of you

All the phrases I might sigh
Could never tell you why
I want so much to hold you and enfold you

All your love bring to me
Come to me, darling, cling to me

And I promise you that

All my life I'll give my all
No task will be too small
And nothing be above me if you love me

All your love, bring to me
Come to me, darling, cling to me

And I promise you that

All my life I'll give my all
No task will be too small
And nothing be above me
If you love me
I will give my all
