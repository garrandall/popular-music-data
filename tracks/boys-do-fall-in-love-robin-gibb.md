Baby said
You got to be a lover one way or the other.
Nobody wins without once givin' in
So don't cry now
Don't cry now.
Love is just a game you play in high school
Girls know how to be cru..
Most of the time girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now
Don't cry..
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room

At the end of the day makin' love to the paper moon
And she said -
Boys do fall in love
They make time
Makin' love on a saturday night.
And she said
Hearts will be as they dance in the street to a radio -
Oh
Boys fall in love.
Baby knows I like to be excited
No one wants to fight it.
It's getting late so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now
Don't cry now.
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room.
At the end of the day makin' love to a paper moon
She said -
Boys do fall in love
They make time
Makin' love on a saturday night..
Boys do fall in love
They make time
Makin' love on a satuday night..

Boys
Boys
Oh
Boys
Boys
Boys
Oh
Oh

Boys
Boys
Boys
Oh
Oh
Boys
Boys
Boys
Oh
Oh.
Boys do fall in love
They make time
Makin' love on a saturday night..
Boys do fall in love
They make time
Makin' love on a saturday night.
