In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?


How could you be so cold
As the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why would she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talking talking talking talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So why I got something new to see?
And you just gon' keep hating me
And we just gon' be enemies

I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
