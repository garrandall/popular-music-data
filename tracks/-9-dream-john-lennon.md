So long ago
Was it in dream?
Was it just a dream?
I know, yes I know
It seemed so very real,
It seemed so real to me.

Took a walk down the street
Through the heat whispered trees
I thought I could hear (hear, hear, hear)
Somebody call out my name
As it started to rain
Two spirits dancing so strange

Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©

Dream, dream away
Magic in the air,
Was magic in the air?
I believe, yes I believe
More I cannot say, what more can I say?

On a river of sound
Through the mirror go round, round
I thought I could feel (feel, feel, feel)
Music touching my soul, something warm, sudden cold
The spirit dance was unfolding

Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
Ah! BÃ¶wakawa poussÃ©, poussÃ©
