Mmm
Here comes the mailman walking up the street
And it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
Because he he brought me, (yes he did)
I said he he brought me, (yes he did)
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong (we had a love)
It would take a lifetime to break us apart
Oh yes
But I found out today I was wrong
And my reward was a broken heart my my heart
Oh here comes the teardrops welcome a welcome to my eyes
And I couldn't hold 'em back no matter if I tried

Wo wo oh
You know it hurt me so inside
Won't you pardon me while I cry
Because he brought me (yes he did)
I said he brought me (yes he did) a letter full of tears
(here comes the mailman) Those aren't drip drop tears (bringing me tears)
Can't you see them falling (here comes the mailman bringing me tears) wo
Wo oh wo wo oh wo wo oh oh oh (hey, yes he did, hey hey , yes he did, hey
Hey hey woo
Yes he did)
I thought (hey hey hey woo yes he did)
We had a love so strong
(hey hey hey woo, yes he did)
