(Oh mammy
Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)

I may be your forgotten son
Who wandered off at twenty one
It's sad to find myself at home
And you, you are not around

If I could only hold your hand
And say I'm sorry yes I am
I'm sure you really understand
Oh Ma, where are you now.

(Oh mammy
Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)

(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)
Oh mammy mammy mammy
(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)
I need you mammy, mammy
(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)

The house we shared upon the hill
Seems lifeless but it's standing still
And memories of my childhood fill
My mind
Oh mammy mammy mammy.

I've been through all the walks of life
Seen tired days and lonely nights
And now without you by my side
I'm lost
How will I survive.

(Oh mammy
Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)

(Oh mammy
Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)

(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)
Oh mammy mammy mammy
(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)
I need you mammy, mammy
(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy, You never miss the water 'til the well run dry
(Oh mamy)
Oh mammy, I guess I'll always be your grownup child
(Oh mamy)
Oh mammy, I need your shoulder to pray if I ever cry
(Oh mamy)
Oh mammy, I need your warm embrase and your comfort and smile
(Oh mamy)
Oh mammy, If only you could see or hear my voice cry
(Oh mammy)
Oh mammy
(Oh mammy - mammy - blue
Oh mammy - Blue)
