Ayy, free D-Dawg
Ayy, 4KTrey
Bitch ass nigga, ayy, ain't nobody, ain't nobody safe
Northside 38, we put guns to the face, who gon' die today?

Gang shit, blow your brain, bitch, who you playin' with?
Pistols get to sparkin', do no talkin', get your mans hit
Them gunners go to tweakin', pop your top, that be that kill switch
That shit you talkin' phony, run up on me, you get killed, bitch
Uh, uh, bangin' 4KTrey, oh, she a slime bitch?
Plus she got some tricks that's up her sleeve that blow your mind, shit
When it come to me, she never scared, she bust that fire quick
Hold on, bitch, I really been that, I ain't tryin'

Taliban, I get a bitch to make 'em buy the iron
He got them, nothin' but convicted felons off of my end
Dive in, I promise after that you gon' get shot then
Green flags in matte black Range Rovers and green FN's
I ain't them dudes, bitch, you gon' pop who? Oh, you should try then
Bitch, I be that nigga cock it back and go to firin'
I'm bustin', no discussion, after that, you hear them sirens
Came in buckin', that shit turnt us up, then people end up dying
Feelin' good, I got drugs in my body
Lookin' for me, come and see me in the back 'cause I ain't hidin'
Cut up, don't try to stop me, bitch, I see you watchin'
Make my shooter kill a nigga, then whack the bitch who drivin'

Gang shit, blow your brain, bitch, who you playin' with?
Pistols get to sparkin', do no talkin', get your mans hit
Them gunners go to tweakin', pop your top, that be that kill switch
That shit you talkin' phony, run up on me, you get killed, bitch
Uh, uh, bangin' 4KTrey, oh, she a slime bitch?
Plus she got some tricks that's up her sleeve that blow your mind, shit
When it come to me, she never scared, she bust that fire quick
Hold on, bitch, I really been that, I ain't tryin'

She gon' pop the cat for me and make it act bipolar
She was in the bed, nigga get to clappin', Leave her rollin' over
Back to back, I stab it, I was leanin' started dreamin', dozin'
You know what I mean, off them beans tryna bend it over
You showin' off your gun, well nigga, pop it then
I ain't sharin' none of my hundreds out my pocket, friend
What you on, say you drove? Need to stop it then
With them tools, I make blues, blow this like a harmonica
Say you gon' stamp me, put yo mammy on that front row
I go to blappin' where you standin' with that Draco
These niggas some hoes, your best interest is to lay low
You say it's up so I catch you, bitch, I'ma knock your fuckin' face low
On gang, nigga

Gang shit, blow your brain, bitch, who you playin' with?
Pistols get to sparkin', do no talkin', get your mans hit
Them gunners go to tweakin', pop your top, that be that kill switch
That shit you talkin' phony, run up on me, you get killed, bitch
Uh, uh, bangin' 4KTrey, oh, she a slime bitch?
Plus she got some tricks that's up her sleeve that blow your mind, shit
When it come to me, she never scared, she bust that fire quick
Hold on, bitch, I really been that, I ain't tryin'
