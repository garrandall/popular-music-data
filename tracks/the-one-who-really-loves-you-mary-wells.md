Some other girls are filling your head with jive
So, now you're acting like you don't know I'm alive
Love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you

Suzie, only wants you
Until the day, yeah
(Only wants you until the day)
That she'll again have her true love
Who's far, far, away, yeah
(Girl to love who's far away)

(Wake-up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Ginny, only wants you
'Cause she thinks she has to have everyone
Minnie, only wants you
For she think that hurting me would be fun
Oh, oh, oh

Silly Lilly
You know she doesn't really want you
Wwith a love that's true
In fact, there's no other girl
In this whole wide world
Who can love you like I do

They get tired of you
Then they're gonna put ya down
(Put you down, put you down)
They ain't gonna want you hangin' around
(Hangin' around, hangin' around)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

I-I-I do (yeah-yeah)
Really, really, love you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah-yeah)

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(I really love you)
Yeah, I really really love you
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
