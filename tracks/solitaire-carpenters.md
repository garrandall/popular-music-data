There was a man
A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifference

A heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
Within his silence

And solitare's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love
It always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope
Goes up in smoke
Just how it goes
Goes without saying

There was a man
A lonely man
Who would command
The hand he's playing

And solitare's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love
It always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

And solitare's the only game in town

And every road that takes him
Takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
