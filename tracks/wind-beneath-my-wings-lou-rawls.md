You know. It must have been cold standing there in my shadow
You never had the sunlight on your face
To know you were content to let me shine
Why you walked a few steps behind

And I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one behind me with all that strength
Just a face without a name
I never heard you once complain

Did you ever know that you are my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got right here in my heart
I want you to know that I know the truth
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you are my hero?
You're everything that I would like to be
I could fly higher, higher than an eagle
I said you are the wind beneath my wings

Did you ever know that you are my hero?
You're everything that I would like to be!
I tell ya, I could fly higher, higher than an eagle
I said you are the wind beneath my wings
My wings
