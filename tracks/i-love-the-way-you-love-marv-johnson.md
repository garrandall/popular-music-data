The sweet things you do to me like holding my hand
When I'm low you let me know you always understand

And, I know (I love) the way you love
You make me feel so fine
I love the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine

I'll never do you wrong, I'll never make-a you cry-why-why
If you stop loving me I know that I'll just die

Because I love (I love the way you love)
Yay, it makes me feel (it makes me feel) so fine
And I love (I love) the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine

Folks tell me now and then "Find somebody new"
I don't care what the people may say, I'm stickin' right here with you

Because I love (I love the way you love)
Yay, yay, I know (it makes me feel so fine)
And I love (I love) the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine

(I love the way you love)
(It makes me feel so fine)
(I love the way you love)
(Because I know you're mine, all mine)

Folks tell me now and then "Find somebody new"
I don't care what the people may say, I'm stickin' right here with you

Because I love (I love the way you love)
Yay, it makes me feel ( it makes me feel) so fine
And I love (I love) the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine

One more time!

I love (I love the way you love)
The way you hold me, baby
(It makes me feel so fine)
Yay, a-yay, a-yay
I love (I love) the way you love
