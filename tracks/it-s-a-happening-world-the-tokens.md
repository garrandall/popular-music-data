Yeah...
Were takin' over
Ey...

Mr. Deranged some may say I'm mental
A fist to the face to keep my name off your dental
Its elemental, his rhymes evidential
But he was screaming so loud you would think he's heavy metal
I got this I got that credibility to back that
Hop up on my track, in reality you sound wack
Real talk I ain't tryna hate though
If you's a real mc how come you sitting on the bench bro
Irrelevant, kill it for the hell of it
Blowing out your candles you would think you was a celebrant
Uninvited guest I'm a tyrant at your resident
Make a lucky guess I devour and leave no remnants
Terminate to educate I'm messing with your mental state
The fight you should anticipate, I'm heavy you just featherweight
LDP confederate, you should probably relocate
Theres a price on your head and you know that I am well awake

Y'all can keep on hating I don't care yeah it's alright
Cause I get a lot of love plus these girls fine
Got my mind on my money steady grind time
Shining brighter never stopping till the world's mine
Never stopping, never stopping till the world's mine

Though how many times you try you can never break my dream
Break my team, make believe but you can't kill my self-esteem
Kingin' and killin' it in the game, that's how we do
Living by doing the right thing, those my people
We gon' reign we'll take a seat on our throne
Pop patron let's share a toast to them sticks and âem stones
Here's for the haters, for the doubter and the douch-ies
Look back at it man it's better than a mo-vie
See what they say don't matter what matter's what we say
We choose our own path don't settle for lee ways
Keep praying with faith and move it to make it happen
Only you can help yourself so mix some action with that passion
Everlasting it's forever once that you find inner peace
Life's a puzzle that you solve by finding that missing piece
You can't buy it with cash you gotta learn to earn it
Work, sacrifice, burn and in return it's worth it

Y'all can keep on hating I don't care yeah it's alright
Cause I get a lot of love plus these girls fine
Got my mind on my money steady grind time
Shining brighter never stopping till the world's mine
Never stopping, never stopping till the world's mine

Make no mistake I'm in the game to put all of you to the test
Make no mistake is exactly my formula for success
Been a perfectionist ever since I was born to be the best there is
Destined to lead Philippine Hiphop to its exodus
Get rid of the pestilence the rest of us should know
That I am more than just a prophet I'm a testament of hope
And I am full of myself call me a bastard truly bold
But if I never came to be the freaking standards would be low
Yo I'm here to own it, here to own the game and mold it
Into something I'd be proud of every time that I would hold it
Make it golden and open make it everybody's token
Make a change think of a thousand ways to recreate the broken
Here to own it, my lyrical style is branded as an asset
And with a flow so great every song I make's a classic,
After classic after classic
And you don't gotsta ask it whatever is the limit to this rapture
I surpassed it, make no mistake about it

Y'all can keep on hating I don't care yeah it's alright
Cause I get a lot of love plus these girls fine
Got my mind on my money steady grind time
Shining brighter never stopping till the world's mine
Never stopping, never stopping till the world's mine

Never stopping never stopping (na uh oh uh)
L D Peace
