Well, you can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay

Well, you get stuck with the wrong woman
There's only one thing that you can do:
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
And pull the ground right over you


Well, you can have her (you can have her)
I don't want her ( I don't want her)
She didn't love me (didn't love me ) anyway (anyway)
She only wanted (only wanted) someone to play with (one to lay with)
But all I wanted (all I wanted) was love to stay (was love to stay)

The girl I love, she, up and left me
She ran away with my best friend
Comes home at night just for an hour
When day light comes she's gone again


Life without love is mighty empty
But confession's good for the soul
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
Than have the world and all of it's gold

(You can have her) you can have her
(I don't want her) I don't want her
(She didn't love you) She didn't love me, (anyway) anyway
(She only wanted) she only wanted (someone to play with) someone to play with
(But all I wanted) Ohh! (Was love to stay) Ohh!

You can have her (you can have her)
I don't want her (I don't want her)
She didn't love me (didn't love me) anyway (anyway)
She only wanted (only wanted) someone to play with (someone to play with)
But all I want (all I want)
All I want (all I want)
All I want (all I want)
All I want (all I want)...
