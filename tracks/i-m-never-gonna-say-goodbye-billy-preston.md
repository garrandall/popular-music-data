Somebody lied to me
It just can't be, you can't be gone forever
Somebody got it wrong
You were gonna love me all my life
Weren't we good together
Now I'm on my own
And I don't think I'll ever learn to live
One day alone

So I'm never gonna say goodbye
Say goodbye is something i can't bring myself to do
Cause as long as I don't say goodbye
Darling I know, part of me will always be with you

What am I gonna do
Having you was all i ever wanted, wanted
Where am I gonna go
To feel the way I felt inside your arms
Still my life is better
Loving you as I do
Thanks for being with me darling
Thanks for being you

Oh,I'm never gonna say good bye
Say good bye, say good bye
Say goodbye is something I can't bring myself to do
Cause as long as I don't say goodbye
Darling I know, part of me will always be with you, with you
