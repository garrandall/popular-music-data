My girl got a big ol' booty
Your girl got little ol' booty


Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing rocking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you bring it

Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine, baby
Let me see ya


Shake shake shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work work work senora
Ride into my ride

Miami is the house without a doubt
Iâm the chico in the club that they yell about
I'm from the city where women are real
Bodies all great 36 24 38, too many body parts fake
Hili dale, I run for you mami
And that ass was off the chain
Hit that thing so hard she call 411

Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing rocking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you bring it

Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine, baby
Let me see ya


Shake shake shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work work work senora
Ride into my ride

Miamiâs in the house without a doubt
Iâm the chico in the club that they yell about
Everythingâs in line that they rub about
Donât believe me, check the bank account
Been around the world like the sun
Iâve seen more breast than your new born son
Mommyâs ass is off the chain,
Iâma hit it so hard she gonna call 411 pain

Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing rocking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you bring it

Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine, baby
Let me see ya


Shake shake shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work work work senora
Ride into my ride

1 little 2 little 3 little 4
5 little 6 little 7 little Ooo


Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing rocking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you bring it

Give it to me dale mama, I like that dale mama
Give it to me dale mama, I like that dale mama
Give it to me dale mama, I like that dale mama
Give it to me dale mama, I like that

Shake shake shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work work work senora
Ride into my ride

1 little 2 little 3 little 4
5 little 6 little 7 little Ooo
