You know everybody talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me
I say you talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me

I had given love, everything I had
All my good turned on me and did me so bad

You just talk about love
Well, baby, here's what love's done to me

You know you talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me
I say you talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me

I've got a heart full of tears but I'll keep on trying
A man's always deceiving me and lying

You know you talk about love
But baby, that's how love's got me

Everybody, talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me
I say you talk about love
But baby, here's what love's done to me

Love's got me praying every night
Everybody I get don't do right
I've given up trying to fuss and fight

You just talk about love
But, baby, that's how love's got me

You just talk about love
But baby, that's what love's done to me
You just talk about love
But baby, that's what love's done to me
You just talk about love
But baby, that's what love's done to me
