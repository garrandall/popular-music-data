(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart

How come my heart deserts me
Burning full of love and desire
How come every time she kiss me
It sets my soul on fire

How come every time she leave me
It seems like I've lost a part
I may be too young to marry
But not to hide an aching heart

(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart

How come every time she kiss me
It thrills me from head to toe
How come every time I see her
It lifts me right off the floor

How come every time I'm with her
She whispers so soft and low
It makes me want to jump and holler
And bump my head into a door

(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young, and Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart

(Too young)
I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young)
