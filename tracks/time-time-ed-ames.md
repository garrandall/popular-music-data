Rolls the hills along
Makes the stars go round
To the sky's bright song
Stirs the endless sea
Maybe time will bring
You back to me

The summer was golden
Their love young and new
His bold arms, her rendesvous

But now leaves have fallen
And tears fill her eyes
His warm lips a memory
As she sighs

The snow's come
And gone now
And still, they're apart
How empty
Her yearning heart

But spring brings it's promise
And old memories burn
While she dreams
With summer, he'll return

Maybe time will bring
You back to me
