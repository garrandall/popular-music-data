I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, but it's a-hurtin'
All I want is for you to make love to me

I'll never be your beast of burden
I walk for miles, my feet are hurtin'
All I want is for you to make love to me

Am I hard enough
Am I rough enough
Am I rich enough
But I'm not too blind to see

I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home girl and draw the curtains
Music on the radio saying come on, baby, make sweet love to me

Yeah all your sickness I can suck it up
Throw it all on me, baby, I can shrug it off
There's one thing, baby, I just can't understand
You keep tryin' to tell me I ain't your kind of man

Ain't I rough enough 
Ain't I tough enough
Ain't I rich enough, in love enough
Please, please
Please, please

Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
Pretty, pretty, such a pretty, pretty little girl
Come on, baby, please, please, please

You can put me out, out on the street
Put me out with no shoes on my feet
But put me out, put me out, put me out of misery
Yeah

I'll never be your beast of burden
Don't need no fussin'
Don't need no nursin'
All I want is for you to make love to me 

I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never (never) never (never)
Never, never, never
