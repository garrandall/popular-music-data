If he loves you
Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town
I'd change my name


When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings


When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings


The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
I'm going to find a place to live
Give you all I've got to give


When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings


If I could break down these walls
And shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying
I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife


When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
