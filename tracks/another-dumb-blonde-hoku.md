I think that itâs time that I should just let you go (let you go)
So I'll tell it to your face instead of tellinâ it to you on the phone (on the phone)

You see I thought that you were special, baby 
Something unique but lately I've come to find
That youâre not really interested in my heart or mind (or my mind)

That's alright, thatâs okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright (that's alright)
That's okay (that's okay)
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me no, no 
'Cause it's not me no, no, oh no

Last night I went to a party hoping I'd see you there
And sure enough you were hanging on some other girl playinâ with her hair
And I overheard you tellinâ her the very same thing you said to me that night before
Hook, line, and sinker you were walking with her out the door

That's alright, that's okay 
You never loved me anyway (I never loved you anyway) 
And I think its time for you to just move on (thatâs alright, thatâs alright)
That's alright (that's alright) 
That's okay (that's okay)
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me no, no

'Come on just a little trophy hanging on your arm so
All your friends are seeinâ you got it goinâ on
When I see what you are so clearly 
But baby, baby that's not alright with me

That's alright that's ok I never loved you anyway
That's alright that's ok you never loved me anyway

You never loved me then it's alright (yeah, yeah)
Then it's alright (yeah) 
Yeah, yeah
I said yeah

It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright
(itâs alright, itâs alright)
Go ahead and find whatcha need
(itâs alright, itâs alright)
'Cause it's alright with me
(then I think itâs time for you to just move on)
