I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get, mmh
Oh, oh she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Nothin' yet, you ain't been around
That's what they told me
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something your never gonna forget, baby
You know, you know, you know you just ain't seen nothin' yet
You need educatin'
You got to got to school
Any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then
She looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something
Here's something that your never gonna forget, baby
Baby, baby, baby you ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
You ain't been around
You ain't seen nothin' yet
That's what she told me
She said, I needed educatin', go to school
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
Got something for you right now
Feels good, alright, how do you do that?
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
I deserve it one of these days
Woohoo, but I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
I ain't seen nothin' yet
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
If you want to show me what I ain't seen, where I ain't been
Lalalalalala
