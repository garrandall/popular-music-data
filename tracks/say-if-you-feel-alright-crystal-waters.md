Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright


Pay attention, listen here
Crystal's gonna make it clear
Everybody here tonight
Better have a real good time
Let your hair down and decide
Come go with me for the ride
Don't sit down, get on up
Join with the rest of us


Hands in the air waving
I want your body shaking
Boot stomping, music rocking
No, we ain't never stopping
Higher and higher, we're going higher
Higher and higher, were going...


Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright


It's the slam, it's the jam
Every child, woman and man
Use your skills you possess
If you wanna pass this test
Don't conserve, just go wild
Turn it up until it's loud
Scream and shout, use your lungs
Y'all join in, let's have some fun


Hands in the air waving
I want your body shaking
Boot stomping, music rocking
No, we ain't never stopping
Higher and higher, we're going higher
Higher and higher, were going...


Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright
Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright

Just say hey (ho!), if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright
Just say hey (now scream!), if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright


Feel the power, feel the heat
Feel together, feeling free
There's no need to ask why
Don't let time pass us by
Come on out, feel the flow
Just let yourself go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Come on, come on, come come


Just say hey (a-ooh-ah!), if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright
Just say hey (a-ooh-ah, ooh-ah!), if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright
Just say hey, if it feels alright
