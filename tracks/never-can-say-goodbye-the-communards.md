No no no no
Never say, never say
Say goodbye. no no no

I never can say goodbye, no no no no I
I never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough, I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration-a piercing me right through the core
It says "turn around you fool, you know you love her more and more"
Tell me why, (Tell me why) is it so?
Don't want to let you go

I never can say goodbye boy, ohby baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, oh, oh
I never can say-a goodbye boy, oho, no
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, oh

Never can say goodbye, no no no no I
Never can say goodbye (Never say goodbye boy)
I keep thinkin' that our problems soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feelin', there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same ol' dizzy hang up, can't do with you or without
Tell me why, (Tell me why) is it so?
Don't want to let you go

I never can say goodbye boy, oh oh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, oh, oh
I never can-a say-a goodbye boy, oh, oh
I never can say goodbye, no no no no no no no, oh, oh

Never can say goodbye boy

Never can say goodbye boy

Every time I think I've had enough, I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration-a piercing me right through the core
It says "turn around you fool, you know you love her more and more"
Tell me why, (Tell me why) is it so?
Don't want to let you go

I never can say goodbye boy, oh oh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, oh, oh
I never can-a say-a goodbye boy
