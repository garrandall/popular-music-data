I sure do hope this is a long night,
Cause I've never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes I fall in,
A little more and more,
Looks like we started us a fire,
Wrapped up in flames of desire, 
With every touch their burning higher,
Two shadows dancing on the wall,

With nothing on but the radio, 
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low, 
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight,
In tangled sheets we'll be here all night,
And when we wake up in the morning,
We might stay like this all day,
Two people meant to be together,
Two lovers dreaming of forever,
And it just keeps on getting better,
With every tender little kiss,

With nothing on but the radio, 
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low, 
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together,
Two lovers dreaming of forever,
And it just keeps on getting better,

With nothing on but the radio, 
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low, 
With nothing on but the radio

You and me and the lights down low, 
With nothing on but the radio
