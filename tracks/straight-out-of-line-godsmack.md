There's no reason
There's no compromise
Change in seasons
Living the high life
I don't know you
So don't freak on me
I can't control you
You're not my destiny

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

I'll confess this you're my tragedy
I laid you to rest just
As fast as you turned on me
Gone for ever
Vanished the memories
Displays of pleasure
Are masked by your misery

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

Lie to me

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

Lie to me
