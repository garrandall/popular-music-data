Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body, oh-oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I already know what you wanna do


Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude


But tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh


You're so damn pretty
If I had a type, then baby, it would be you
I know you're ready
If I never lied, then baby, you'd be the truth


Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude


But tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh


(Hah! Luda)
Tonight I'm, gonna do (Gonna do)
Everything that I want with you (With you)
Everything that you need, everything that you want
I wanna honey, I wanna stunt with you (You)
From the window to the wall, gotta give you my all (My all)
Winter and the summertime
When I get you on the springs, I'ma make you fall (Make you fall)
You got that body that make me wanna get up on the floor just to see you dance (Dance)
And I love the way you shake that ass
Turn around and let me see them pants (Pants)
You stuck with me, I'm stuck with you
Let's find something to do (Do)
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude


But tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh, that tonight I'm fuckin' you
Oh-oh, you know-oh


That tonight I'm fuckin' you
Yeah, tonight I'm fuckin' you
Yeah
