We've already said goodbye
Since you've got to go
Oh you'd better go now
Go now, Go now
Go now
Before you see me cry
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling, darling
I'm still in love with you now?

We've already said so long
I don't want to see you go
Oh you'd better go now
Go now, Go now
Go now
Don't you even try...
Telling me that you really don't want me to end this way
'Cause darling, darling
Can't you see I want you to stay?

Since you've got to go
Oh you'd better go now
Go now, Go now
Go now
Before you see me cry
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling, darling
I'm still in love, still in love with you now?

I don't want to see you go
But, darling, you'd better go now
