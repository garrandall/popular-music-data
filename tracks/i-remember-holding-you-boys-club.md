Time will never lose
Memories we choose
Choices that we've made for love

Voices in my head
They call me away
You were right beside me
I'm in love


Maybe I should have known it
Maybe I should have seen
But I stayed lost in my dreams
Now that you're gone


I remember holding you
Feeling felt so right
Now I find I'm reaching out
In the middle of the night

All those things
I should have said
Now my chance is gone

All alone
I'm reaching out
Even though I know
It's wrong, so wrong


We will never know
What my heart will never show
I will keep it all inside

Somehow when I tried
You knew that I lied
In my heart
I feel untrue






Oh, I know
I know, I know
I know it's wrong

All the times I should have seen
Everything you meant to me
Now I only hold you in my dreams



I remember holding you
I remember holding you
(I know, I know)
(I know, I know it's wrong)

I remember holding you
I remember holding you
I remember holding you
(Feeling felt so right)
Felt so right

All those things
I should have said
(Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah)
I remember holding you
