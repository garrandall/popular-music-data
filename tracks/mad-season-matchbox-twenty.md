I feel stupid
But I know it won't last for long
And I've been guessing
And I could have been guessing wrong
You don't know me now
I kinda thought that you should some how
Does that whole mad season got you down?


Well I feel stupid
But it's something that comes and goes
And I've been changing
I think it's funny how no one knows
We don't talk about
The little things that we do without
When that whole mad season comes around


So, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?
It seems to me you'll come around


I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season


I feel stupid
But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know I still turn you on
You've grown colder now
Torn apart, angry, turned around
What that whole mad season knock you down?


So are you gonna stand there, are you gonna help me out?
We need to be together now


I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season


And now I'm crying, isn't that what you want?
And I'm trying to live my life on my own, but I won't, no
At times I do believe I am strong
So someone tell me why, why, why
Do I, I, I
Feel stupid
And I come undone
Well I come undone


I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken


Well I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, I'm a child and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come, oh, I come undone, in this mad season


In this mad season
It's been a mad season
Been a mad season
