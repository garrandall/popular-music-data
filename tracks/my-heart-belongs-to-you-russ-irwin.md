Love will bring all the things
That we choose to give it
And everything lost within
Then we will find forgiveness

And all that we believed
Is lost and not received or so it seems

And my heart belongs to you
And if I'm far away
Something in me remains

And my heart belongs to you
And if you feel so bad
Think of the love we have

And you will see that love is the root of resolution
And anger breeds only the road of desperation

And all that we believed
Is lost and not received or so it seems

That my heart belongs to you
There is no compromise
Nothing to fear or hide

And when you can't find nobody else
To share a smile or show some comfort
Baby when I can't be with you
You've got to know that

Still my heart belongs to you
Here and from far away
Something in me remains

And all that we believed
Is lost and not received or so it seems

That my heart belongs to you
