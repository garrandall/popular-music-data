Everywhere everywhere
Everywhere I go
Everywhere that Iâve been
The only thing I see is
Is beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Donât you know donât you know
Youâre beautiful donât you know
Donât you know donât you know
Beautiful donât you know know know

Live your life live your life
Let the love inside
Itâs your life itâs your life
Got to play it right
Take your time take your time
Take your sexy time

Lose your head lose your head
Your beauty itâs inside you
Inside you
Donât let âem bring you down no
The beauty is inside you
Donât let âem bring you down
Cos you start your life today
Live any thoughts youâve dreamed off

Everywhere everywhere
Everywhere I go
Everywhere that Iâve been

The only thing I see is
Is beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Donât you know donât you know
Youâre beautiful donât you know
Donât you know donât you know
Beautiful donât you know know know

Take your time take your time
Take your sexy time
Lose your head lose your head
Your beautyâs deep inside
Inside you
Donât let âem bring you down no
Your beauty is inside you
Donât let âem bring you down no
The beauty is inside you

Donât let âem bring you down

Everywhere everywhere
Everywhere I go
Everywhere that Iâve been
The only thing I see is
Is beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Donât you know donât you know
Youâre beautiful donât you know
Donât you know donât you know
Beautiful donât you know know know
