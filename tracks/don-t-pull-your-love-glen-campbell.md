Don't pull your love out on me baby
If you do, I think that maybe I'll just lay
Me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me here to drown in my own tears

You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird
Gonna fly right out of here without a single word
But you know you'll break my heart
When I watch you close that door
'Cause I know I won't see you any more

Haven't I been good to you
What about that brand new ring
Doesn't that mean love to you
Doesn't that mean anything
If I throw away my pride and I got down on my knees
Would you make me beg you pretty please

There's so much I want to do
I've got love enough for two
I'll never use it girl If I don't have you

Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you just wait a life time before you leave
If you must go, I won't say no
Just so we can say that we tried
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
