Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together

I am so happy, baby
Now that you are my lady
We can hold hands together
Every day, come what may
I promise you I'll always 
Give you my lovin' always
You can depend on me girl
All the time, rain or shine

You're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it
Day time, night time
Your time, my time

Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together never felt like this before
Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together

You bring me new excitement
I never knew what night meant
We got a thing together 
very few ever knew
You can be sure of one thing
All of the love that I bring
I'm gonna keep you happy
All the time rain or shine

You're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it
Day time, night time
Your time, my time

Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together never felt like this before
Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together

Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together never felt like this before
Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together
