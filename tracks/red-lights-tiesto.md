Blacked out, everything's faded
On your love I'm already wasted
So close that I can taste it now... now

So let's break right out of these gilded cages
We're gonna make it now
Don't ever turn around
Don't ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go...
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

There ain't no reason to stay
We'll be light years away...
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights...

White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can't ignore...no...

We can't back down
We'll never let them change us
We're gonna make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go...
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

There ain't no reason to stay
We'll be light years away...
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights...
We could just run them red lights...
