A man can't do
No more than a woman'll let him
She won't make mistakes
If she knows she'll regret them
A woman'll stick by ya
Through thick and thin
And a  woman like this
I know I got to win


I know (I know I got a sure thing)
Honey, I know (I know I got a sure thing)
I know (I know I got a sure thing)
I got a sure thing (sure thing with my baby)
Listen to this


Me and my baby been together
Through all kind of weather
I don't care what happens
We're always together
When I see her talking
To some fellow out on the street
When the conversation is over
She comin' straight home to me


Yeah (I know I got a sure thing)
Oh yeah (I know I got a sure thing)
I know (I know I got a sure thing)
I got a sure thing (sure thing with my baby)
Listen to this too


I go to work in the morning
With a satisfied mind
Don't have to worry
About that woman I left behind
When I come home in the evening
My aching back she'll rub
Dinner's on the table
And my woman's in the tub


Oh (I know I got a sure thing)
Ha ha ha, I know (I know I got a sure thing)
I know (I know I got a sure thing)
I know (sure thing with my baby)


Mmm (sure thing with my baby)
I got a sure thing (sure thing with my baby)
Oh (I know I got a sure thing)
I know (I know I got a sure thing)
She's everything (I know I got a sure thing)
She's my woman in my dreams (I know I got a sure thing)
