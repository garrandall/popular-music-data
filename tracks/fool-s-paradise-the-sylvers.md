Living your lives in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
Of high society
Living your lives in a fool's paradise
But what can I do


I didn't make this world
I was only born
That's everybody's attitude
Who's life was torn, oh
(Life) is not what you make it
That's what the upper class make it seems to you
Well (Come on, come on now)
People, open up your minds
'Cause this is what you wanna do


Living your lives in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
Of high society
Living your lives in a fool's paradise
It's part of growing up


A child shows much perception
But he's pointing the finger
In full spite of profit and go-getters
Who strives for more, oh oh
More money, more power, more security
He stays so empty inside
So busy trying to get ahead
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
Except for


Living your lives in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
Of high society
Living your lives in a fool's paradise
If there's some people choose
Who's life they're willing to lose
But never
Will they fight their own war


Then he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
Then he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
Then he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
