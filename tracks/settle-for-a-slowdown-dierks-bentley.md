I must look just like a fool here
in the middle of the road
standing there in your rearview
and getting soaked to the bone
this land is flat as it is mean
a man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
the glow of a brake light.

But your wheels just turn,
down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
the slightest sign that you might miss
what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
but I'd settle for a slowdown.

I held on longer then I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
would fade in time.

But your wheels just turn
down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
the slightest sign
that you might miss
what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
but I'd settle for a slowdown.

But your wheels just turn
down the road ahead
if it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
your just a tiny dot on that horizon line come on tap those brakes
baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
Im not asking you to turn back around

I'd settle for a slowdown
come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down.
