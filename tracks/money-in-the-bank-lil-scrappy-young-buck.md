Okay-kay-kay-kayyy, G's up, Lil Scrappy
I got money
BME (BME), money in the bank, G-Unit!

I got money in the bank (yea)
Shawty what you drank

I'ma get that, dough and fuck with dem, hoes
Young ladied that know me know Scrappy's a, pro
Fill up at the, bar go get a mas-sage
Find me a couple we can make it a, me-nage
You be tryin, hard but nigga don't, start
You be doin shit is gon' get you to the, morgue
I go get that, paper a mega f**kin watch
I be pullin out knots, that can buy me a, yacht
Hold on baby, please, go get on yo', knees
If you don't do it for me then do it for the, cheese (yea)
I got extra weed (yea) money long like sleeves (yea)
If a nigga try to creep, I got extra heat
Got a bank account (cha-ching) with a large amount
If a nigga wanna talk, nigga we can let it bounce (bounce)
Take it outside, nigga fuck fallin back
Killers run up in the club, ballin with a bigger stack

Two step with me, let me show you how it goes

The Murcielago, lemme show you how it rolls
I got a Bentley that I only drove one time
50 bought it for me shorty but it's still mine
My Chevy clean and the paint look like lemon-lime
You wanna shine, it ain't hard, just get on your grind
We keep a bankroll, wallet full of credit cards
Cup full of Cristal, box full of cigars
Dirty South tatted on my back, I'm country
She said she like the way I talk, these hoes love me
Club goin crazy, we throwin out stacks
G-Unit South yeah, tell the DJ bring it back
See I'm A-Town stompin in a A-Town hat
But I'm reppin Tennessee, like my homey Project Pat
It ain't 'bout where you from homeboy it's where you at
Scrappy beat me on the dice, yeah it's cool I'll be back
Cause I got

50, got me, Lil Jon, got me
I got a big-ass squad, how you gon' stop me
Y'all niggas, watch me, rise to the, top
My shit gon', sell, yo' shit gon', flop
Lil Jon, got me, 50, got me
I got a big-ass family, how you gon' stop me
Y'all niggas, watch me, rise to the, top
My shit gon', sell, yo' shit gon', flop
