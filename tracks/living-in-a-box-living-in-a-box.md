Woke up this morning
Closed in on all sides
Nothing doing
I feel resistance
As I open my eyes
Someone's fooling
I've found a way to break through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on in my own mind

Am I living in a box?
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?

Life goes in circles
Around and around, circulating
I sometimes wonder
What's moving underground
I'm escaping
I've found a way to break through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on in my own mind

Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?
Woah

Uh-huh
I found a way to break through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on in my own mind

Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living, am I living, am I living
Am I living, am I living, am I living

Am I living in a box? (am I living, am I living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box? (am I living, am I living)
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?
