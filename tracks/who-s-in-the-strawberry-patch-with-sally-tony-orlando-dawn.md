One day happy, one day sad
Feeling good, then feeling bad
In anger words are spoken
Then haste a heart is broken

Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Now that she's not picking them with me?
Oh no, I don't care what they're doing there
'Neath the shade of the old apple tree

Hey, I bet they're laughing and talking love talk
Just like the way we used to do
Ah, who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Whispering 'I love you'?

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love-maker
That I ever had
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally?
Who's making love to her tonight?

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love-maker
That I ever had
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
While the Wabash moon is shining bright?

Had I been true to her
I'd be there now
In the strawberry patch with Sally tonight, oh yeah
In the strawberry patch with my Sally tonight
