Don't ya love her madly 
Don't ya need her badly 
Don't ya love her ways 
Tell me what you say 

Don't ya love her madly 
Wanna be her daddy 
Don't ya love her face 
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door 
Like she did one thousand times before 

Don't ya love her ways 
Tell me what you say 
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door 

All your love 
All your love 
All your love 
All your love 

All your love is gone 
So sing a lonely song 
Of a deep blue dream 
Seven horses seem to be on the mark 

Yeah, don't you love her 
Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door 

All your love 
All your love 
All your love 

Yeah, all your love is gone 
So sing a lonely song 
Of a deep blue dream 
Seven horses seem to be on the mark 

Well, don't ya love her madly 
Don't ya love her madly 
Don't ya love her madly
