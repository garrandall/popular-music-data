Go granny go

I was sitting on the beach
Just picking up some sun
When my buddy ran up to me
He said you won't believe what's going on
But it's something that you've gotta see

You know that bathing suit
That they're talking about on the tv and radio
Well granny's wearing one by the hot dog stand
And she's putting on quite a show

Yeah, in her one piece topless bathing suit
In Boston she'd be banned
In her one piece topless bathing suit
She's the coolest girl in the sand

So I got up to take a look at her
And I finally made it through the crowd
Where some of the guys were clapping their hands
And some of them were laughing out loud
But there she was like my buddy did say
For everyone to see
That little old lady about 94 doing the watusi
Yeah, oh... ha ha ha

One piece topless bathing suit
In Boston she'd be banned
In her one piece topless bathing suit
She's the coolest girl in the sand
Yeah... go granny go

One piece topless bathing suit
And she's only 94 years old
One piece topless bathing suit
And she's only 94 years old
(Repeat to fade)
