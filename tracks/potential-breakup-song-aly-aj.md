It took too long
It took too long
It took too long for you to call back
And normally I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday
My stupid birthday

I played along
I played along
I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
Don't let me go
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Living for me

This is the potential break-up song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please
Please tell me

We got along
We got along
We got along until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that?
Let me repeat that
I want my stuff back

You can send it in a box
I don't care just drop it off
I won't be home
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Minus you I'm better off
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Living for me

You can try, you can try
You know I know it'd be a lie
Without me you're gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly
Bust up the situation that you're gonna miss dearly, dearly
C'mon

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
(no)
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
(no, no, no, no)
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
(no, no, no, no)
Living for me

This is the potential break-up song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please
Please tell me

This is the potential make-up song
Please just admit you're wrong
Which will it be?
Which will it be?
