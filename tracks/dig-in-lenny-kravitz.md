It's time to face and come-on in and join the party
Life has been waiting for you to care
Don't try to fake it, jump on in and get it started
There's so much lovin for you to share!

There is nowhere to run
There is no way to hide
Don't let it beat you
Say 'nice to meet you' and 'bye'

Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Wake up and shake it, you didn't make your contribution
There ain't no time for you to spare
If you ain't part of the game then how can you find a solution
Nobody said that it would be fair

When the mountain is high
Just look up to the sky
Ask God to teach you
Then persevere with a smile
Yeah yeah yeah

Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time
Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time
Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Once you dig in
Yeah yeah yeah
And once you dig in
You're gonna have yourself a good time

Once you dig in
Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side

And once you dig in
