Fish were made to swim in the ocean
And boats were made to sail on the sea, yeah
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
(You were made for me)
(You were made for me)

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree, yeah
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
(You were made for me)
(You were made for me)

We’ll have our quarrels
And you’ll upset me
(Tell me what can I do?)
But what-what can I do?
You’ve been mine
Since the first minute I met you
(Never) And I’ll never
Never, never leave you

(Fish were made to swim in the ocean)
Oh, yes, they were
(Boats were made to sail on the sea)
Oh, yeah (Uh-uh-uh)
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me

(Grapes were made to grow on a vine)
Oh, yes, they were
(An apple was made to grow on a tree)
Oh, yeah (Uh-uh-uh)
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me

(You were made for me)
Oh, yes, they were
(You were made for me)
Oh, yeah
(You were made for me)
Like a fish in the ocean
(You were made for me)
Like a boar on the sea, baby
(You were made for me)
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
(You were made for me)
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
(You were made for me)
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
(You were made for me)
Yeah
(You were made for me)
I know, you were made for me
