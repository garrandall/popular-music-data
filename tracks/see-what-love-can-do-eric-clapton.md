When your world, it starts to fall apart
Look deep within, within your lonely heart
Do your best my friend, try and understand
It's only you, pull yourself through


When you tell your story
Make sure your story is right
Every little single word is true
See what love can do
See what love can do


When the words are in the music, the music is the song
The world would be so happy, if we would all just get along
I want to see it, a smile on every face




See what love can do
See what love can do
See what love can do
See what love can do
