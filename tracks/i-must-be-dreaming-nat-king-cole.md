I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be because

You say you love me
You say you want me
You say you need me
And I can't believe that

Someone as wonderful as you
Could change my luck
And make my dreams come true

I must be dreaming
But if I'm dreaming
I'll go on dreaming
The rest of my life
Dreaming of you

I must be dreaming
But if I'm dreaming
I'll go on dreaming
The rest of my life
Dreaming of you
