(Had to survive, livin' in the light
Have to stay alive, livin' in the light
Have to survive
Livin' in the light)

Hold the beat, stop the beat, drop the beat

Children of nature
From another culture
Had to survive
Livin' in the light

Stolen from the center (Of the world)
Untimely departure
Somehow survived
Livin' in the light

(Had to survive, livin' in the light
Have to stay alive, livin' in the light
Had to survive
Livin' in the light)

Rootical subculture
Oh, the sound of the street dub-vendor
Knew you had to survive
Livin' in the light

Beautiful yet scattered
Through it all your spirit never shattered
Glad to stay alive
Livin' in the light (Oh)

(Had to survive) Oh, I, I, I (Livin' in the light), I, I
(Have to stay alive, livin' in the light) Ohohohohoh
(Had to survive) Yes, in a light
(Livin' in the light) So bright, had to guide you home

(Have to survive, livin' in the light) Children of nature
(Have to stay alive, livin' in the light) Livin' in the light, yes
(Had to survive) Had to survive
(Livin' in the light) I, I, I, I, I

There's ways we can sometimes turn our wrong to right (Aha)
But some things we can never change
Things can be so fine
Livin' in the light

(Hold the beat, stop the beat) (Oh) (Drop the beat)

To those who know what I mean
And those who don't, I'll tell you
Follow good feeling through
And let the superficial pass you by, oh yeah

Livin' in the light, yeah, yeah

(Have to survive, livin' in the light) Children of nature
(Have to stay alive, livin' in the light) Livin' in the light, yes
(Had to survive) Had to survive
(Livin' in the light) I, I, I, I, I (Oh)

(Have to survive) Oh, I, I, I (Livin' in the light), I, I
(Have to stay alive, livin' in the light) Livin' in the light, yes
(Had to survive) Had to survive
(Livin' in the light) I, I, I, I, I

Yeah (Had to survive, livin' in the light)
Ow! (Had to stay alive, livin' in the light)
(Had to survive
Livin' in the light)
