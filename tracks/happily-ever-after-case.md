Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last May, don't know the exact day
In my hand there was a ring
And you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
And I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife (yes I will)
I will be your man, your protector, your best friend
'Til my humble life is ended
Then time begins again (couldn't we)

Couldn't we please be happily ever after
We can be strong together for so long (our love goes strong so long)
Couldn't we please be happily ever after (couldn't we be, baby)
Leaving you never stays forever strong


When I was away (umm...hm)
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
In so many times, could picture this day inside my mind
And for so many years, oh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh(yes I will)
Take you for my wife, the center of my life
And I will never ever fade
From this choice I've made, oh...oh

Couldn't we please be happily ever after (come on)
We could be strong together for so long (said my love is strong)
Couldn't we please be happily ever after (Couldn't we please baby)
Leaving you never stays forever strong (hey...oh...hey yeah)

You don't have to look no further than me (don't look no further, baby yeah)
You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy (I'm so happy I'm so happy, babe)
Beneath the side of God, I will make this vow to you (come on baby)
I'll be right here, stay with me (stay with me, baby hey)

Couldn't we please be happily ever after (Said I wanna be...said I wanna be)
We could be strong together for so long (Our love is...)
Couldn't we please be happily ever after (Couldn't we please baby)
Leaving you never stays forever strong (No, No...Said No, No I will never leave you, oh
