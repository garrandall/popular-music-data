Life was only a cloudful of rain
With the sun never shining on me
Sad and lonely but then when she came
She was all that I wanted to see

I want you to be mine
All I need is the words and the rhyme
I want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way
The image I see
Is that really me
To need you more each and every day?

She was looking like handwoven dreams
In her eyes I saw oceans of pearls
There she was, I felt lost it seemed
I could only be thinking of her

Want you to be mine
All I need is a little more time
Want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way
The image I see
Is that really me
To need you more each and every day?
