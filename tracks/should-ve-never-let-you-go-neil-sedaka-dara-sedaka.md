When you walk into a room
Your beauty steals my breath away

When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say

Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should have never let you go

(should have never let her go)

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share

But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear

I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so

Why did I have to write this song
I should have never let you go

Why in all the wide, wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear

I'll never understand

I'll never understand

Why I even give a damn

When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground

I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down

You're the kind I can't forget

Let the tears begin to flow

I have only one regret
I should have never let you...go
Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go
