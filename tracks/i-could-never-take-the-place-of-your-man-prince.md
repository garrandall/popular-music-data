It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Hm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah


And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man


It hurt me so bad when she told me
With tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
She couldn't stop cryin' cause she knew he was gone to stay
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
You know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied


And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
Oh OOhOhOhh!Oh



1, 2...
1, 2, Woo!

Ah...Oh
