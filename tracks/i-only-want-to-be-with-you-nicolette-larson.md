I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'cos you started something, can't you see
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked me if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

Now, listen, honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'cos you started something, can't you see
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked me if I'd care to dance
I feel into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

Now, listen, honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'cos you started something, can't you see
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you
No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you
No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you
