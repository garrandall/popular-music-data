I know
I know you had enough (Oh)
I know you had enough (Oh)
But stay a while (Oh)
I know you had enough of me (Of me)

Get 'em down, had enough
You and all your friends hopped out that Bentley truck (Yeah)
You doing your thing, baby live it up (Live it up)
You showin' out and you don't give a fuck (Yeah)
It's a rodeo, go on and touch your toes (Touch your toes)
I might hit you from the back and that's as far as it goes (Goes)
I done knocked 'em all down like some dominoes (Dominoes)
She get money off that pussy and she climb the pole (Yeah)
You got two choices, either heaven or hell (You got two choices)
Meanwhile put that dope on the scale (Dope on the scale)
Meanwhile, bitch I'm watching for twelve (Uh, huh)
Prayin' to my God, I ain't goin to jail

I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me
I can't really tell what you want
I know you had enough of me


Hey
Know you had enough (What?)
Livin' like what the fuck (Who?)
You can't trust, you think I'm in love with lust (Oh)
She look possessed, go and get it off your chest (Hey)
She asked to read my texts, lookin' in her eyes, she stressed (She stressed)
Shawty get wet like baguettes (Baguettes)
Take off your gown and your dress (Take it off)
She got C-cup, D-cup breast (D-cup)
She a bird and she live in a nest (Brrr)
I'ma swerve and get off of the X (Swerve)
The rock on her finger dyslexic (Stupid)
Get the money, I gotta protect it (Protect it)
On my hand, but I never regret shit
All these bitches lying, wanna sex me (Sex)
Eat it up tryna catch me (Eat it up)
They want the dressing and the recipe (Recipe)
I want the buns like the sesame (Sesame)


Yeah
And I can really tell that she love me (Yup)
Overload on Chanel and make her weep (Make her weep)
Know you had enough of the side piece (Side)
Know you had enough, we drink like five kegs (Purple)
Spike Lee, do the right thing (Right)
But she can't get enough of the piping (Pipe)


I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me
I can't really tell what you want
I know you had enough of me
