Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars


Fresh out from my bid
Bitch it's Lil Tuneche
I Lucille Ball, bitch I love Lucy
If these niggas dogs, I'm animal cruelty
Don't fuck with me at all, cause I'm twisted like an Rubiks cube
Oh my, look how the tie has flown
And they say time is of the essence
But what if there clock is wrong
But all my problems will be second
And all my worries will be gone
I'll have money back for breakfast smell like "bitch I'm rich cologne"
Ha, I'm so relaxed my Gucci flats ain't got a scratch
If you got a problem with I, well I will fix them, cataracts
They say it cost to be the boss
I paid the price including tax
Bitch I'm a fire flame spitter
And to me you niggas wax


(What ya talking bout)


In this World with my Tommy gun
But 9 clipped the red rum
100 millions dollars, put my life down for my son
Spend a little cash, bust a nigga ass
5 star nigga, 2 mill on the dash
Yeah, militant minded
Upown soldier, you have been blinded
Grinding all the time, nigga
Stuntin, and we shining
Diving in deep shit, the money keep climbing
Blah, the bottles keep poppin'
Dom P, Rose, Perrier poppin'
The bitches see we rocking, the whips we be rocking
Iced up, tatted up, fire flame blaaap




Uh, I got pussy coming to me
Shot gun in my draws make your woman bite the bullet
Sittin' in my hog, tell my chauffer to the pent house
Pockets so deep it's like my money gotta swim out
Marley say fuck em, Scoob say fuck em
Bitch I still the best overall like a jumper
Weezy F F, fire flame spitter
Hundred million dollars, pocket change nigga


See these first class flights
We strapped up in the trenches
Nigga want some business bitch
We getting it in this business
Some ten figure niggas blood rich gang nigga
Fire flame spitters, point blank nigga
Money and the power, swag out the shower
Spending nigga pen, them pussy's running like some cowards
Bigger than life nigga, c4 bitch
Ahundred million dolllars, my son born rich
Blaaapp!


Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
