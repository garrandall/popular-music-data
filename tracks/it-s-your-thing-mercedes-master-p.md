Hello?
(May I speak to Mercedes?)
Yeah, this me
(Is JaQuon over there?)
Who?
(JaQuon)
Oh


Let me tell you about your baby daddy
Waking me up early in the morning, we gone and
How you know he's creeping with me
How you think I know you get off of work around three
I suppose you want to sit and chat
Probably wondering where your man is at
So why you keep on sweatin' me, testin' me
When it's truly plain to see where he wants to be
Right here next to me


It's your thang, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)


Me tell no lies, yeah I like to ride
Keep your eyes on your prize, tell your homegirls don't cry
Say uhhh when you get it, I'm a soldier when I hit it
Hoody hooo when I get it, I told you wasn't no limit
At four circle, I'm a V-12, girl can't you tell
I'll rock your bells from eight, to twelve
Make you want like a dog, my name below your drawers
I know you want it all, ha ha ha ha, but don't fall

Let me tell you about your baby daddy
Waking me up early in the morning, we gone and
How you know he's creeping with me
How you think I know you get off of work around three
I suppose you want to sit and chat
Probably wondering where your man is at
So why you keep on sweatin' me, testin' me
It's truly plain to see where he wants to be
Right here next to me


Ohhh oh oh
Ohhh oh oh
Ohhh oh oh
You got me twisted, callin' me about your man
You got me twisted, callin' me about your man

(You got me twisted girl
Talkin bout goin on Jerry Springer
Huh, don't hate the player baby, hate the game
Matter of fact, why don't ya'll put these boxing gloves on
I know you just got your nails and your hair done
But uh, whoever win, it's your thing boo
Ha, that's what I'm talkin' bout)
