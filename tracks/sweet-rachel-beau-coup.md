Rachel, what do I do now
You got me going but I can't
Seem to find out what to do

Cause I'm a man that finds
Himself giving all I can
Then you tell me time
Will bring us closer at hand


Sweet Rachel
When am I gonna find out
The world's not always
What we want it to be
Sweet Rachel
When am I gonna find out
That it'll always be hard for me

Rachel

When I was younger
I could run all around
But now I'm older
Dreams seem to settle down
Yes, they do

I've got so much love
Living down inside my soul
But I'm afraid my heart
Can't take the lonely toll



Rachel

Sweet Rachel
When am I gonna find out
The world's not always
What we want it to be

Sweet Rachel
When am I gonna find out
The world's not always
What we want it to be

Sweet Rachel
Rachel, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet Rachel
Rachel, oh, oh, oh, oh
