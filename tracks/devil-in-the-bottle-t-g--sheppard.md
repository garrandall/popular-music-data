I come home late at night with my shoes in my hands
Stumble in the back door being quite as I can
And I know she there in bed cold and all alone
And she's crying cause I'm breaking up our home

And she knows (and she knows) the hell I'm going through
In this world (in this world) inside my head
There's a devil (there's a devil) in a bottle
And he wants to see me dead

I fall into her arms and she helps me with my clothes
Yeah she stays on with me cause she really knows
Cause I'm trying lord to find my freedom
By escaping to the only freedom I've ever known

And she knows (and she knows) the hell I'm going through
In this world (in this world) inside my head
There's a devil (there's a devil) in a bottle
And he wants to see me dead

There's a devil (there's a devil) in a bottle (in the bottle)
And he wants (and he wants) to see me dead
And it's killing her to see me die this way
