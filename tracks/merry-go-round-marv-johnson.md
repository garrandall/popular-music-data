Merry-go-round, merry-go-round, merry-go-round, merry-go-round

I love you but you love him
He loves her and she loves me
Tell me why, why, why is love a merry-go-round
Merry-go-round, merry-go-round?

I need you but you need him
He needs her and she needs me
Tell me why, oh why, why is love a merry-go-round
Merry-go-round?

To love and not be loved in return
Is like no, no love at all
But darling, my darling, why can't you see
That I was meant for you
And you were meant for me?

Oh, I love you but you love him
He loves her and she loves me
Tell me why, why, why is love a merry-go-round
Merry-go-round, merry-go-round?

Oh why, is love a merry-go-round?
