Seems like the other day 
My baby went away 
She went away, 'cross the sea 

It's been two years or so 
Since I saw my baby go 
And then this letter came for me 

It said that we was through 
She found somebody new 
Oh, lemme think, lemme think 
What shall I do 

Oh, no 
Oh, no 
Oh, no no no no no 
Remember, walking in the sand 
Remember, walking hand in hand 
Remember, the night was so exciting 
Remember, her smile was so inviting 
Remember, then she touched my cheek 
Remember, with her fingertips 
Remember, softly 
Softly we met with a kiss 

Whatever happened to 
The girl that I once knew 
The girl that said, she'd been true 
Oh, whatever happened to 
That night I gave it to you 
What will I do with it now 
Oh... 

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no
Remember, walking in the sand
Remember, walking hand in hand
Remember, the night was so exciting
Remember, her smile was so inviting
Remember, a then she touched my cheek
Remember, with her fingertips
Remember, softly
Softly we met with a kiss 

Whatever happened to 
That girl that I once knew 
That girl that said, she'd been true 
Whatever happened to 
That night I gave it to you 
What would you do with it now
