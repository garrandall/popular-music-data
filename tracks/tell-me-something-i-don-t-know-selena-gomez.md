Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feeling
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreaming


I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no


Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know


Tell me, tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me something I don't know


Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
This life I'm pursuing
The odds I'd be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million
One in a billion
One in a zillion


I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no


Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know


Selena, hit the track
Like Katrina, making waves
Like Cold Medina, make them say, "I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
Really ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say it won't be easy


Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know


Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
