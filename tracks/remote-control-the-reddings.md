Transistor connector, solid state invention
Guaranteed to make you move
So much coming from this little bitty box
Gets your mind into a groove.

News, music, commercials too
Everything from jazz to pop
Night, day, or in between
Seems like it will never stop

Here comes the music,
Push button to your soul
How do you use it
Turn on your radio.

Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Your Radio (It's coming at your body, let it take control)
Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Let it take control (It's coming at your body, let it take control), Ooh

Everybody's got one, some have two or three
Some wear head phones on the street
Car stops at a stop light, if you check it out
Driver's rocking to the beat

Games, weather, and recipes
It's about as plain as day
Young, old, they all agree
Radio is here to stay, Yeah

Here comes the music,
Push button to your soul
How do you use it
Turn on your radio.

Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Your Radio (It's coming at your body, let it take control)
Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Let it take control (It's coming at your body, let it take control)

Here comes the music,
Push button to your soul
How do you use it
Turn on your radio.

Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Your Radio (It's coming at your body, let it take control)
Remote Control (Theres a good, good feeling on your radio)
Let it take control (It's coming at your body, let it take control)
