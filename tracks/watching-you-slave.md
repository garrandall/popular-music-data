Walking down the street
Watching ladies go by
Watching you
Walking down the street
Watching ladies go by
Watching you


Watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you


Looking at the ladies, all of them fine
All of them so lovely, I can't make up my mind
But I'm lookin' at you from the corner of my eye
I can see you now, you're steppin' so high and I'm


Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (one look and I was hooked on you, baby, whoa)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (watching you)
Watching you
Watching you


There you go swayin', blowin' my mind
You've got everything groovin' in time
God gave her beauty, she carries it well
I'm staring at your heart, baby, hoping you can tell


Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (hope that you can tell that I'm watching you, love)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (with the naked eye, baby, whoa)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (you're far away, but I can still see you clearly, whoa)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (watching you)


Love at first sight
Oh, baby, you're blowin' my mind
I just got to let you know
Energy flowin'
I said it feels so good
I gotta tell you my name is Stevie
What's yours, baby, whoa


Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (I'm watching you and only you, baby, whoa...ho...)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (you're blowin' my mind)


Gonna do a little dance for you
Watching you
Watching you


The girl looks just right to me, ha
Combination smile, body, physique, whoa, ho
All the ladies I've seen are really fine but
Baby, I'm watching you, you're right down my line


Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (oh...baby)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (oh you're right for me, you're right to the tee, baby)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (what must I do to let you know I'm checkin' you)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Watching you (whoa...ho...ho...yi, yi, yi)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by (whoa, whoa, ho)
Watching you (yi-yi-yi, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, oh, oh, oh)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, oh, oh, oh)
Watching you (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you
