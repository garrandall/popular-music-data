Up in the heavens
Across the sky
There's a place
Where love is divine

Lovers go there
All of the time
To be island of love
In the sky

And some day if
You stay with me
I take you there
Wait and see

Our dreams will come true
All of the time
On the island of love
In the sky

One of these nights
I'll hold you tight
And press your lips

To mine

Then if your love
Is really true
Angels would take
Us away

Way up to the heavens
Across the sky
To paradise
We will fly

They'll be so happy
All of our lives
On the island of love
In the sky
