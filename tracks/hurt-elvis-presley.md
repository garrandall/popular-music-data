I'm so hurt to think that you lied to me
I'm hurt way down deep inside of me
You said our love was true and we'll never, never part
Now you've got someone new and it breaks my heart


I'm hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Yes darling, I'm so hurt because I still love you so
But even though you hurt me like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you, oh you, not you
