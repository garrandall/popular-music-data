Mmm, I really gotta know
If you trust me, do you trust me now?
Hey, I really gotta know


You know that I love you
And that ain't gon' change
And though you're not here with me now
My love for you stays the same
Don't worry about those other girls
They can't take your place
You're the only woman in my world
And you can't be replaced


(Girl, you know)
You know that I love you
(Oh girl)
Girl, you're everything to me
(Oh girl)
Just let me show you
(Oh baby)
Just how much you mean to me


It's been such a long time
Since I've been with you
My friends say I should play around
They wish that they could have what I found in you
You know I'm not that other guy
Who broke your heart, mmm
You're still the only woman in my world
Even when we're apart


(Girl, you know)
You know that I love you
(Baby, yeah)
Girl, you're everything to me
(Just let me show you)
Just let me show you
(Oh baby)
Just how much you mean to me
(Girl, you know)
You know that I love you
(You know that I love you, pretty baby)
Girl, you're everything to me
(Just let me show you)
Just let me show you
(Show you, baby, oh oohyeah)
Just how much you mean to me


(Oh, girl)
I only have eyes for you
(Oh, baby)
Believe me, what I say is true
(You know it's true now)
You know my heart belongs to you
(And only you, and you can't be replaced)


(Girl, you know)
You know that I love you
(You know that I love you, baby)
Girl, you're everything to me
(You know that I love you, baby)
Just let me show you
(Just let me show you now)
Just how much you mean to me
(What you mean to me now)
You know that I love you
(Said, you know that I love you, baby)
Girl, you're everything to me
(You're everything to me)
Just let me show you
(Baby now, baby now, yeah)
Just how much you mean to me
(Oh, girl, yeah)
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
(Oh, girl)
Just let me show you
(Oh yeah)
Just how much you mean to me
(Oh, girl)
You know that I love you
(Said, you know)
Girl, you're everything to me
(To me)
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
