Funny how the phone stopped ringing
Your heart stopped singing
The way it used to do

You don't know who's to blame
Or if there's a reason
You just know you were warm
And now you're freezing

Funny, no goodbyes was spoken
The spell was broken
By the path of silent sighs

Funny, it's, oh, so funny
Funny how you just
Can't dry your eyes

You don't know who's to blame
Or if there's a reason
You just know you were warm
And now you're freezing

Funny, no goodbyes was spoken
The spell was broken
By the path of silent sighs

Funny, it's, oh, so funny
Funny how you just
Can't dry your eyes

Funny how you just
Can't dry your eyes
Funny how you just
Can't dry your eyes
