Whoo-hoo...
Whoo-hoo...

Walking home in the rain
And blood runs cold in my veins
News from a distance shore
Blues like never before
The moon is new
The moon is full
The moon is blue
The moon is cruel
Painted moon

Coming to the rescue
Angels from another world
Love is here to stay
So the angels say
Running to the rescue
Angels flying up above
Phantoms in the bay
While the natives pray
To the painted moon

I wash my face and get dressed
And time cuts into my wrist
So who invents our dreams
The hands that hold the machine
The moon is blue
The moon is cruel
Painted moon

Coming to the rescue
Angels from another world
Love is here to stay
So the angels say
Running to the rescue
Angels flying up above
Phantoms in the bay
While the natives pray
To the painted moon

Painted moon
Painted moon
Painted moon

Coming to the rescue
Angels from another world
Love is here to stay
So the angels say
Running to the rescue
Angels flying up above
Phantoms in the bay
While the natives pray
To the painted moon

Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Painted moon
Painted moon

Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Painted moon
Painted moon

I said...
