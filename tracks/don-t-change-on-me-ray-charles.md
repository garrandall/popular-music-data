Girl, you're my sunshine
Take away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river
Keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop
Keep it going, oh Lord


Well, I love you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me, yeah
Don't you change on me
I said, don't you change on me, no, no
Girl, you're my lucky star
Honey, don't change on me, yeah
Oh please, don't change on me
I keep begging, don't change on me, yeah


I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
I was living in darkness
But then you came
Bringing the sunlight
Easing my pain, God




If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
I want to know you
If we should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
No more stormy weather
