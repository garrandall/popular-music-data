Candles burning, glasses are chilled and soon she'll be by
Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try
And if all those plans I made don't melt the lady's heart
I'll put on the old 45's

And maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

It's been too long since I've seen her face light up when I come home
It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you to bring her back to me
I'm tired of listening alone

And maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay
