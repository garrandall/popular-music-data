Yeah, yeah (Hit-Boy)
, yeah, yeah
Sean, what up nigga? (Sean, what up nigga?)
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah, yeah


Couple riders with them llamas if you pick a bone wit' me
Put my bitch up on designer, got Balenci' on her feet
My momma say a couple prayers, keep them demons off me
Cause I know my head blessed, got so many reasons on me
Yeah niggas done tried and niggas done died, too many believers around me
Yeah I know my enemies meeting up, double teaming on me
Now you know nobody tried that ever got pieces off me
Fucking these hoes 'til they be dying, don't catch a seizure on me
See, Ferg used to move the product in the whole school (Yeah)
My psycho bitch, she got me shopping up at Whole Foods

I got your bitch up on the mattress while I'm fly no T (Woo!)
I'm sick and tired of all the yapping, little nigga I'm your OG (Woo!)
My diamonds shining like the ball that drop on New Year's Eve (Come on!)


Now drop down, you a freak (Milly rock)
Bend it over, touch your feet (Yeah!)
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique
Back that thing up on my nigga from the D


Okay, back out the hearse, they trapped out the church
Niggas say my name, okay they asked for the worst
Me and A$AP Ferg preaching back to back on the verse
Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk
Kill 'em all one-by-one, "Final Destination"
Fuck that medication, I'm sipping cold flu Echinacea
You done fucked up, I stayed up, sleep deprivation
They on the search nigga Know your worth nigga
Tell the DJ bring it back, reimburse niggas
Hum-du-allah, my finance advisors been through hell
Oh well, pshh, we on fire
Brung her back home more times than McGuire, higher
Trap Lord packed out the risers
Big getting his bread, your pocket on carb diets
I just start up a riot at all the Hyatts
And make them hoes leave right before they cook the omelettes


Drop down You a freak
Bend it over (Yeah) Touch your feet
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique
Back that thing up on my nigga from the D
On God!

Bend it over, woah (Come on!), touch your feet (Touch your feet)
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique (So unique)
 (Oh, that's me?)


Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
Me and A$AP Ferg preaching back to back on the verse
Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk
