When you just give love, and never get love
You'd better let love depart

I know it's so, and still I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love, and now you've gone
Since I fell for you ...

My life has been such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you ...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get these blues most every night
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get those blues most every night
Since I fell for you ...

Since you loved me, then you snubbed me
I prayed you put no one above me
Now I'm black and blue since I fell for you

Since I fell for you...For you...yeah
