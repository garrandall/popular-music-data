Five long years
We have been together
Your love and understanding
Has brought us through stormy weather
I must admit girl
I haven't always been good
But you stuck by me
Just like you said you would
Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams
If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver
I only did the things
I thought I had to do
And if I hurt you baby
I'll make it up to you
I can't say
I haven't done any wrong
Let him without sin
Cast the first stone
Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams
If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver
Let's forget about the past
Ride to a brand new day
Jumpin' over stumbling blocks
As they wander in our way
We got to keep goin'
'Til we reach our destination
Don't let nothin'
Hinder your inspiration
Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams
If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream baby
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream now
It might spoil our secret dream, child
It might spoil our secret dream, baby
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Oh girl, hey, hey, hey
Ride, ride, ride, ride, oh girl
