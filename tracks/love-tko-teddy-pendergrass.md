Looking back over my years
I guess I shedded some tears
I told myself time and time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight things ain't right,
I am losing again
Take a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

I think I'd better let it go
It looks like another love TKO
Think I'd better let it go (What you mind about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh Yeah)
Looks like another love TKO

Tried to take control of love,
Love took control of me
Because you lose all thoughts, sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps and the bruises
Of all the things of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on, faith is gone
It's just another sad song
