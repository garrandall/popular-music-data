Lookin' back over my years
I guessed, I've shedded some tears
Told myself time and time again
This time I'm gonna win
But another fight, things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again


Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O


Tried to take control of the love
Love took control of me
Cause you lose all thoughts, sense of time
And have a change of mind
Takin' the bumps and the bruises
Of all the things of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on, faith is gone
It's just another sad song


Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O


Tried to take control of the love
Love took control of me
Cause you lose all thoughts, sense of time
And have a change of mind
Takin' the bumps and the bruises
Of all the things of a two-time loser
See I try to hold on, my faith is gone
It's just another sad song


And I think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O
Oh, sometimes, sometimes I just feel like I wanna say, I wanna say
Cause it looks like another love T.K.O
Tired of gettin' beat up by love
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
Think I'd better let it go, let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O
Oh, they say love is better the second time around
Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
Cause I, cause I, cause I, I think I'd better let it go
