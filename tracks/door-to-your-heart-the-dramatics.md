Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?

In the corridor on a wall
Underneath the staircase in the hall
On a hook behind the door
In the closet, on the floor

In the cupboard on a shelf
In the basement in the dark
Oh, anywhere, see if there's
A place for me in your heart

'Cause I've been wanting you, needing you
Having you, waiting for the door to your heart
To swing open, to swing open
To swing open so that I can come on in

Let me in
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?

In the corridor on a wall
Underneath the staircase in the hall
On a hook behind the door
In the closet, on the floor
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

In the cupboard on a shelf
In the basement in the dark
Anywhere, won't you see that
Just one little
Place for me in your heart

'Cause I've been wanting you, needing you
And loving you, waiting for the door to your heart
To swing open, to swing open
To swing open so that I can come on in

Let me in, let me in
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
In your heart, anywhere

Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
