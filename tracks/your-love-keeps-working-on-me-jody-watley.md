I was so lonely
I was left with no one to call my own
Then you came along, boy
And saved my heart from turning to stone

Baby, you and your lovely smile
Opened my heart wide as a country mile
Like a bird that had broken wings
Through you I have learned how to fly

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Could I be dreaming?
I don't wanna wake up and find you gone
I never imagined, baby
That I feel like a queen on the throne

Do you know what, what you do to me?
You keep me flying high on this ecstasy
When you kiss me all over
Your passion burns straight through my heart

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

I don't know what you do to me
(Your love keeps working on me)
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
(Your love keeps working on me)
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Don't you ever leave me, baby
'Cause I have never felt so good
I think about you every morning
I think about you late at night
I just can't seem to get you off my mind

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, boy, it sets me free, yeah
I don't know what you do to me
But I've got to tell you, boy
Your love keeps working on me

I don't know what you do to me
(Your love keeps working on me)
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
(Your love keeps working on me)
But I got to tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Don't know what you do to me
Your love keeps working, working
Don't know what you do to me
But I got to tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me, yeah, yeah

Your love keeps working on me
Your love keeps working, working
Your love keeps working on me
Say, I got to tell you
Your love keeps working on me

Your love keeps working on me
Your love keeps working on me
Your love keeps working on me
Your love keeps working on me
