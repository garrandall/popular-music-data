Old man look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Old man look at my life,
Twenty four and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two

Love lost, such a cost,
Give me things, that don't get lost.
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Old man take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
and you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you.

I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last.
Rolling home to you.

Old man take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through

Oh look at my eyes
You can tell that true
Old man look at my life,
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through

Oh look at my eyes
You can tell that true

Old man look at my life,
I'm a lot like you were.
Old man look at my life,
I'm a lot like you were.
