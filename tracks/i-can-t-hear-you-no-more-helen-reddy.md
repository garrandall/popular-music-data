Here you are again
Tell me you're sorry baby
Tell me you wanna come back home
Where you belong
There you go again
Lyin and alibi'ing
Singin that same old worn out song
Here it comes now
I can't hear you no more
I've heard it all before
You ain't reachin me no how, no way
No time till noon today
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
You walked out on me
Once too often baby
And I can't take no more of your jive
And that's the truth
I ain't about to let you
Rub me in the ground
I'm not gonna throw away my youth
Not for any man
I can't hear you no more
I've heard it all before
You ain't reachin me no how, no way
No time until noon today
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
I've heard it all before
