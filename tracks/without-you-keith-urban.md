I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet

It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Oh Without you yea yea

Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me cause I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure

How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Without you oh

Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been building up so high
It's never gonna touch the sky without you

Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you
