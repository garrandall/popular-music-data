Lonely Silver Dove
Sweet Apache maid
Lonely Silver Dove
Sweet Apache maid

Alone, all alone by the campfire
She dreamed of her love, her delight
Away, far away on the prairie
Her love Golden Hawk shared the night

Sometimes at night with the moon he would come
Sweet were the moments they shared
But with the dawn he was gone with the sun

A smoke sign arose from the prairie
A breeze sighed a sad mournful song
The brave Golden Hawk had departed
Had gone to that great, great beyond

Sometimes at night when there's rain in the sky
She hears her love high above
He and his pony go thundering by
