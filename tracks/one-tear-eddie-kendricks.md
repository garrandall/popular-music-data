I wake up early every morning
With just one tear in my eye
I remember late one evening
My sweet baby said goodbye to me
Oh yes, she did

I cried so hard when she left me
I just rolled up in a great big ball
All my life drained from my body
'Cause that one tear
That one tear just wouldn't fall

How I tried to forget her
But this one tear won't set me free
I didn't know till she went away
Just how much that woman meant to me
Oh yes, she did

Without her my life is nothing
Even though she let me down
If my baby don't come home to me
In this one tear
In this one tear I'm gonna drown

Every night I, I say a prayer
And I whisper something, Lord
I've got to get my baby back
So this one tear
So this one tear will let me go

You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me

You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me
