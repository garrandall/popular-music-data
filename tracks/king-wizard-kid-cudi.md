I canât decide
What if lifeâs a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyâll learn
I canât ever front, know why?
Itâs not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, theyâll burn
I canât decide
What if lifeâs a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyâll learn
I canât ever front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Theyâll never take me alive
King Wizard!


You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know that uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, donât know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, yâall niggas really just donât know
Go, All day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ainât left
Iâm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ainât missed one step yet, yep




My head hurt, gotta give me something thatâll make me feel good
I remember couldnât tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ainât working, like me I had to put my bit in
All this rose gold Iâm dipped in dressed in ? while I coast in clouds
Thatâs my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
Iâm going, going Iâm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
Itâs finally my world
Here all the girls can be my girl
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl
