Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?

Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me, she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?

And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have, but it's really too late
Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh, another place



She just left me yesterday
She just left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, do you know what I mean?

She's a dandy, yes indeed
She's a dandy, but now she's free
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean? Yeah

Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, learn how to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?

Yeah, here comes it now..
