With your innocent eyes
You’ve been telling me lies
You’ve been making a fool of me
If it’s all a disguise
I’ve been living a fantasy
You’re lying with your innocent eyes
This situation I can do without
So don’t trouble yourself to call, I just found you out
While your lying eyes are saying
You wanted only me
Your heart is with another
And you’re saying what you think I’ll believe

With your innocent eyes
You’ve been telling me lies
You’ve been making a fool of me
If it’s all a disguise
I’ve been living a fantasy
You’re lying with your innocent eyes
How did I ever believe you
It was no surprise
Ah, just one look and I fell
For your innocent eyes
You’re lying with your innocent eyes
You’ve telling me lies
You’ve been making a fool of me
You
You
