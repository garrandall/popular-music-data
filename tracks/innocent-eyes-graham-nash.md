With your innocent eyes
Youâve been telling me lies
Youâve been making a fool of me
If itâs all a disguise
Iâve been living a fantasy
Youâre lying with your innocent eyes
This situation I can do without
So donât trouble yourself to call, I just found you out
While your lying eyes are saying
You wanted only me
Your heart is with another
And youâre saying what you think Iâll believe

With your innocent eyes
Youâve been telling me lies
Youâve been making a fool of me
If itâs all a disguise
Iâve been living a fantasy
Youâre lying with your innocent eyes
How did I ever believe you
It was no surprise
Ah, just one look and I fell
For your innocent eyes
Youâre lying with your innocent eyes
Youâve telling me lies
Youâve been making a fool of me
You
You
