Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play


Every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn


And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way


I'm always dragging that horse around
Our love is pastured such a mournful sound


Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground


So I like to keep my issues strong
But it's always darkest before the dawn


Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa


And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart


'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before


The dawn


Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa


Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa


And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back


And given half the chance would I take any of it back


It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone


It's always darkest before the dawn


Oh hoo oh hoo...


And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't


So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope


And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope


It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat, cause


Looking for heaven,


Found the devil in me
Looking for heaven,


Found the devil in me
But what the hell


I'm gonna let it happen to me


Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
