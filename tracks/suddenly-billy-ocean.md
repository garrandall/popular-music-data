I used to think that love was just a fairy tale

Until that first hello
Until that first smile.
But if I had to do it all again I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause this love is everlasting.

Suddenly - life has new meaning to me.
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of

You wake up and suddenly you're in love.

Girl
You're everything a man could want and more.
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside.
Holding hands as we walk along the shore

Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for.
Suddenly - life has new meaning to me...

Each day I pray this love affair would last forever.
Suddenly - life has new meaning to me...
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of

You wake up and suddenly you're in love.
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of

You wake up and suddenly you're in love.
