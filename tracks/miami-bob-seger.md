They saw the lights on the horizon
Out of the seas it came shinin'
The buildings so high
They seemed to touch the sky
Miami, Oh, Miami

They felt the warm breezes blowing
From off the strange new ocean
They reached the end safe
It was a new day
Miami, Oh, Miami

Oh, it must've seemed
Something from a dream
Shinin' through the night
All those city lights
Staring at the shore
Hungry, tired and worn
Could it really be
Were they really free

And so they came
A hundred thousand
To find a way of life
They could believe in
Far away from home
With nothing of their own
To Miami, Oh Miami

They saw the lights
Miami
