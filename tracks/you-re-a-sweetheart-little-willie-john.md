You're, you're a sweetheart
If there ever was one
If there ever was one
It's you

Life without you
Was an incomplete dream
You are every sweet
Dream come true

My search was such a blind one
And I was all at sea
I never thought I'd find one
Quite so perfect for me

Oh, you're, you're
You're, you're
You're a sweetheart
If there ever was one
If there ever was one
It's you

My search was such a blind one
And I was all at sea but
I never thought I'd find one
Quite so perfect
Quite so perfect
Quite so perfect for me

Oh, you're, you're
You're, you're
You're a sweetheart
If there ever was one
If there ever was one
It's you
