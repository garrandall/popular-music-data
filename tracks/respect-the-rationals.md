What you want, honey, you got it
What you need, honey you got it
All I ask is a
A little respect
When I come home

Hey, hey
Alright baby, yeah

You can do me wrong, honey
If you wanna
You can do me wrong, honey
While I'm gone
All I want is
Just a little respect
When I come home

Hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Alright baby, yeah

Hey little girl
You're so sweet little honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
All I want from you is,
Just a little respect
When I come home

Hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
C'mon, c'mon, cmon

Hey little girl
You're so sweet little honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
All I want is,
Just a little respect
When I come home

Yeah now baby
Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need
Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need
I just got to have it
I just got to have it
I just got to have it
I just got to have it
Just a little respect
Got to, got to, got to
Respect is what I need
