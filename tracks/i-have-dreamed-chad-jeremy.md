I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper
When you're close, so close to me

How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view

In these dreams, I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you

In these dreams, I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you
Loved by you, loved by you
