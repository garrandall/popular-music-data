As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines, that to me were so dear
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded love
