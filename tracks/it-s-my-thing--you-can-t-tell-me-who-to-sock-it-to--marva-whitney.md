You don't wanna leave me, man
It ain't no big deal
I don't need love
As bad as you
Makes no difference
Who you sock it to


Oh, it's my thing
That I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
Oh, it's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me, you can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
