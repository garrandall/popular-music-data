Outside my window, rain is falling down
And I can see your face, mirrored in my mind
I have to wonder, is this just a dream?
Are you thinking of me looking through your window too?
And I'll make a wish and send it out to you
I've got all my heart and all my love to give
I didn't mean to make you hurt or make you cry
I still feel this love, girl, deep inside...

I wanna stay forever with you
Feeling every heartbeat so close to mine
I wanna stay forever with you
Holding on to every breath
Stay forever with you

I remember all those endless nights
And we'd look into each other's eyes
Making everything alright
And every kiss would go on for eternity
The feeling of your touch would take my breath away

Oh, and I'll make a wish and send it out to you
I've got all my love and all my heart to give
And it's hard to feel it girl but I feel it too
Don't wanna live my life without you

I wanna stay forever with you
Feeling every heartbeat so close to mine
I wanna stay forever with you
Holding on to every breath
Stay forever with you

Even though we're apart, girl
I feel so close to your heart And now time is standing still
Waiting for you

I wanna stay forever with you
Feeling every heartbeat so close to mine
I wanna stay forever with you
Holding on to every breath
Stay forever with you (stay forever with you)

I wanna stay forever (feeling every heartbeat)
You know it's true
I love you
Stay forever with you (I wanna stay forever)
Holding on to every breath
Stay forever...
Stay forever with you...
I need you, my baby
Feeling every heartbeat
You know it's true...
I love you...
