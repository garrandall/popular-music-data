Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflections will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

An' I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe, I may be losin' you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms and you told me
"We don't need to worry, but you
You never say you're sorry"

Keep this love alive, for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
(I weep)
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

Haa, haa
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess, either one is my addiction
And where you're leadin' me I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But livin' in your arms
I can take it
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver

Let the Gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth girl, I love you still?
(The truth)

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
(Losers weep)
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

Hoo, hoo, hoo
Don't let him get too close to you
(You've got a stranger on your mind)
The dream is free
I know I'm only human if I cry
(Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye)

Hey
Hey, hey
Girl, I love you still

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
(Ah)
No one wins and losers weep
(Nobody wins)
Deception will show
(Show)
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
(Ah)
This is all we need to know

(Still)
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
(Ah)
No one wins and losers weep
Reflections will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
