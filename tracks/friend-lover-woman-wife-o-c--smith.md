She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife
She's the answered prayer every lonely man dreams of
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves

Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
And I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping;
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry
The morning always seems to catch us laughing
With the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times that I'm having
Wrapped up in my woman's loving arms
She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife
She's the answered prayer every lonely man dreams of
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves

And when the load gets heavy on my shoulders;
And I can't keep the pace, and I need a place to hide
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms
And hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside
'cause she's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife
She's the answered prayer every lonely man dreams of
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves
