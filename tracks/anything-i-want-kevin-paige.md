People always sayin' what you can and cannot do
Well listen to me people I just do what I want to
I cannot justify a man with the power
To decide if and when I come down off my tower

I know with the power from above
I can make it work for me when it comes to push and shove
I know from the talk upon the street
I can make a difference in who I meet

I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
Let it be anything anything anything I want

All my life I've always followed my dreams
People think you're crazy for your self esteem
I ain't gonna sit down on my attitude and pout
I'm gonna be heard even if I have to shout because

I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
Let it be anything anything anything I want

Take for instance just because I'm white
They say son you can't jam like that your skin is too light
But what kind of crap is that for someone to say
I think they're jealous because I jam the groove way
Kick it

I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
I can do anything I want I say you can't
Stop me from jammin' on
Let it be anything anything anything I want

Everybody sing with me say Anything I want they will not
Stop me from jammin' on no kick it
I can do you can do we can do anything we want
