In a couple of hours I'll be drivin' home to the one I love
So save your breath sweet painted lady it won't be me
Over the mountain and under the sea
They'll never be another one like mine for me
It was only an hour or so ago that I sang my song
Persuaded painted ladies that I could say I'd been free


Over the mountain and under the sea
They'll never be another one like mine for me


Mine is always, mine is grand
Don't you know that the woman that love me she understands
And can't you see that it's mine for me
And in a couple of hours I'll be driving home to the one I love
So save your breath sweet painted lady it won't be me


Over the mountain and under the sea
They'll never be another one like mine for me
You're for me, yeah

Mine is always, mine is grand
Don't you know that the woman that love me she understands
And can't you see that it's mine for me?


They'll never be another one like mine for me, yeah, yeah
They'll never be another one like mine for me, yeah, yeah, yeah
They'll never be another one like you for me
