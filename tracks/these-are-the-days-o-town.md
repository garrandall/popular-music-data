Motel, sitting in the dark
Empty room like an empty heart
Lovers stop, but they never stay
They don't look back as they drive away
Maybe I can fix this broken neon light
Fill in the cracks and paint it bright
That maybe love will stop here tonight


And if she knocks on my door
I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes
And I know I'll be everything that she sees in me
More than I ever thought I could be, but...


These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days


I gotta use this lonely time
To change the picture in my frame of mind
Outside the window, there's a sunny day
I wanna feel it on my face
You and I
We're out here looking for the same thing
An end to all the wondering
Waiting for someone to share this feeling


And if she knocks on my door
I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes
And I know I'll be
Everything that she sees in me
More than I ever thought I could be, but...


These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days


These are the days between your hopes and fears
These are the moments that are still unclear
It's still uncertain if she will appear
But like it or not, this is what I got
Oh, but


These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
And I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
'Cause these are the days
These are the days
When all that I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever
Living in the in-between
I'm stuck here in a place without love
And I just can't let it stay this way
But for now, I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days
