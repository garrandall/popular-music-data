I see raindrops falling
But they're not falling from the sky
I see my tears falling
Since you, since you said goodbye

My heart slowly breaking
And I know the reason why
My heart been forsaken
Since I, since I made you cry

Can't you see I'm sorry
My love for you will never die
I'm so brokenhearted
Since I, since I made you cry

Since I, since I made you cry
Since I, since I made you cry
