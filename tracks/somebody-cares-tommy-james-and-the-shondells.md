If you think I'd ever leave you,
Girl, you're wrong, I'd never want to.
And how could you know that my love is real?
A-take this kiss, and you'll know how I feel.


Somebody cares, and I'm gonna make you see.
Somebody cares, so put your trust in me, baby.

Now the time is going and the sky is cloudy.
The birds are leaving and the cold is nearing.
A-trust in me and you'll know the reason
That our love will last through many a season.



So give me a smile and you'll know that our love's true.
Don't be in doubt, 'cause I'd never hurt you.
A-trust in me and you'll know the reason
That our love will last through many a season.
