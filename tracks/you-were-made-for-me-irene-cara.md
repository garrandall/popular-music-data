People say I'm naive
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
And it will surely break
If love should ever leave
But I don't mind what they say
I know this love is gonna stay
'cause in the deepest part of my heart of hearts
I know that we will always be this way

I know you were made for me
Nothing can ever change, it's meant to be
Just like the moon was made for a lonely night
You are my light
Forever in this light

I thought I knew love before
With you I've found there's so much more
More than the love we make
It's the feelings we two can explore
We're just a woman and a man
We'll make mistakes like we all can.
But through it all, you'll see
By your side I will be
Growing closer to you each passing day.

I've heard it said that love is a crazy game
You play a little while then the partners change
Somewhere my heart knows our love has stood the test of time
You'll be mine
