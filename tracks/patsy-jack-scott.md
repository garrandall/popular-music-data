Ah, Patsy I'll be waitin'
Standing by the schoolyard gate
Ah, Patsy I'll be waitin'
Standing by the schoolyard gate
Now tell your mama and your papa
We've got a heavy date
Patsy, we're goin' strollin'
Strollin' at the record hop
Oh Patsy, we're goin' strollin'
Strollin' at the record hop
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And teach you how to rock
Now we're gonna (rock, Patsy, rock)
We're gonna (roll, Patsy, roll)
We're gonna (hop, Patsy, hop)
We're gonna hmmm (ohhh! )
I'm gonna show you how to swing
I'm gonna teach you everything I know
(Go, Patsy, go! )
(No!, no!, no! )
I'm gonna show you how to swing
I'm gonna teach you everything I know
Well, Patsy I'll be a-waitin'
Standing by the schoolyard gate
Now Patsy, I'll be waitin'
Standing by the schoolyard gate
Ah, tell your mama and your papa
We've got a heavy date
Well, now we're gonna rock (go, Patsy, go)
We're gonna roll (go, Patsy, go)
We're gonna hop (go, Patsy, go)
We're gonna... huh, well (go, Patsy, go)
Hm (go, Patsy, go)
Oh yeah (go, Patsy, go)
Oh Patsy (go, Patsy, go)
Uh huh (go, Patsy, go)
