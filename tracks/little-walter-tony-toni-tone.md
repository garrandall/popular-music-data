Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, "I doubt it'll be today"

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Started coming up with clothes I could not buy
And some I could not find
Taking girls to dinner, two at a time
I didn't pay no mind
When I saw him driving a brand new fancy car
I knew he'd gone too far
So when I tried again to ask him to pay today
Walter said, "Today? No way"

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Things were getting serious, I had to set him straight
My landlord could not wait
I sat him down and told him, he played me for a fool
'Cause I knew the things you do
Things start getting nasty, we broke into fight
I thought it would be short, but it lasted half the night
By the time we were finished, there was a knock at the door
When Walter went to open it, he was blown to the floor

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter
