Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy

Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way

Bonafide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done

Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy

Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way

Standing up, keep me on a rise
Lost control of myself, I'm compromised
You're incriminated, no disguise
And you ain't never running low on supplies

Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy (And you stay flexing on me)
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy

Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (Yeah babe)
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (Yeah babe)
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way

Hop in the Lambo', I'm on my way
Drew House slippers on with a smile on my face
I'm elated that you are my lady
You got the yum, yum, yum, yum
You got the yum, yum, yum, whoa
Whoa-oh

Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy

Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (Yeah babe)
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (Yeah babe)
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way
