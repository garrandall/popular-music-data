It came unannounced.
This feeling I feel for you.
I had to know was it what you felt too.
Not through your words but the way that you looked at me told me just how.
How much you really care.

So don't you try and hide your feelings cause it's so very plain to see.
(I can see forever) Forever in your eyes.
(In your eyes)
Just let your heart faithfully guide you.
Guide you to love infinity.
(I can see forever) Forever in your eyes.
(In your eyes)

Here we are.
Baby the time is right.
Now there's no doubt what the feelings right.
So just say the word cause I'm in it much too deep to turn away.
So please say you'll stay.

So don't you try and hide your feelings cause it's so very plain to see.
(I can see forever) Forever in your eyes.
(In your eyes)
Just let your heart faithfully guide you.
Guide you to love infinity.
(I can see forever) Forever in your eyes.
(In your eyes) Forever in your eyes.

Aww yeah.
I can see forever in your eyes.
Ah yeah.
Do I wanna hold you?
Your head on my shoulder.
With you, I'll never tire.
We'll take it higher and higher.
Do I wanna hold you? (I wanna hold you)
Your head on my shoulder. (Lay your head on my shoulder)
With you, I'll never tire. (I'll never tire)
We'll take it higher and higher. (Oo oo baby)

I'll never hurt you baby.
I'll never be untrue.
All my hopes and dreams, I realize that they're with you, baby.
I'll never leave you sugar.
I'll never leave your side.
Our love is here forever.
I can see it in your eyes.

Do I wanna hold you?
Your head on my shoulder.
With you, I'll never tire.
We'll take it higher and higher.
Do I wanna hold you?
Your head on my shoulder.
With you, I'll never tire.
We'll take it higher and higher.
