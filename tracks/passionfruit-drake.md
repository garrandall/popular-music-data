Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this mothafuckin' record
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better


Listen, seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no


Trying to think of the right thing to say
