J. White, I need a beat, I can't go off, off (Oh)

Lil Sally Walker walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me

I said go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), drop (Go)

Lil Sally Walker, uh, shake it proper, uh
Bend it over, make it wobble, uh, got a lot o' buns
Pick it up and drop it, uh, for the proper funds
Anything to make the profit come, get them dollars, hon'
Add that shit up just like mathematics
If you do it for free, then it's ass backwards
All of you bitches is mad at me
Pro'ly mad cause you ain't in my tax bracket
You bitches is broker than glass crackin'
You ain't gon' do shit, you just act ratchet
Play with me, you gon' get back handed
I toot it up and look back at it

Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me

I said go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), drop (Go)

Watch me throw it back and toot it, they love how I do it, uh
I'm the truth, you can't refuse it, plus my body's stupid, uh
He wasn't even shot by Cupid, but your dude's a groupie, uh
You would think it's getting evicted how my booty moving
Yeah, better yet, I need a U-HAUL
One of a kind, I don't do malls
These bitches talk more than group calls
Shut the fuck up with them loose walls
Matter fact, I'm not gon' go back and forth
With you bitches like Duval and Snoop Dogg
These bitches front like a new bra
Don't get your ass dragged like RuPaul

Lil Sally Walker walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do so she jumped in front of me

I said go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go)
Do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do your thang (Go), do your thang (Go), drop (Go)

Go, go, go
Go, go, go (Do your thang, stop)
Go, go, go
Go, go, go (Do your thang, drop)
