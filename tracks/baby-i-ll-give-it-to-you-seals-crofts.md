Seals-Bogan

You say you wanna know what you gotta do
To make me forget what you put me through
So you want a chance to prove, lovin' me is everything to you


Baby, I'll give it to you. Baby, I'll give it to you
No one can make me feel like you do
Baby, I'll give it to you

I just want you to know, I know I done you wrong
When I wasn't here the nights were so long
And I wanted you so, but oh
Now I'm back again and I'm beggin' you please


You gotta hold me closer than you did before
And always be there so I'll know for sure
I really, really love you and I'm here to stay
But I promise you tomorrow's gonna be a better day
Well, that's all we gotta do then baby I'll know
I'll be lovin' you, and we can start over
