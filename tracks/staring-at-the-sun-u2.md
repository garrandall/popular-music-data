Summer stretching on the grass... summer dresses pass 
In the shade of a willow tree creeps a crawling over me 
Over me and over you stuck together with God's glue 
It's going to get stickier too... 
It's been a long hot summer 
let's go undercover 
Don't try too hard to think... don't think at all 

I'm not the only one starin' at the sun 
Afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside 
Not just deaf and dumb i'm staring at the sun 
Not the only one who's happy to go blind 

There's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear 
It's gonna itch and burn and sting 
Do you want to see what the scratching brings 
Waves that leave me out of reach 
Breaking on your back like a beach... 
Will we ever live in peace? 
Cause those that can't do often have to 
Those that can't do often have to... preach 

To the ones staring at the sun... 
Afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside 
Not just deaf and dumb... staring at the sun 
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind 

Intransigence is all around... military is still in town 
Armour plated suits and ties... daddy just won't say goodbye 
Referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will HE listen 
I'm nearly great 
But there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free 
Though you never really belonged to me 

You're not the only one staring at the sun 
Afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside 
I'm not sucking my thumb I'm staring at the sun 
Not the only one who's happy to go blind
