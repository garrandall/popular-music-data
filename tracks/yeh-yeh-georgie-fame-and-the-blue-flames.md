Every evening when all my day's work is through
I call my baby, and I ask him what shall we do.
I mention movies, but he don't seem to dig that
And then he asks me why don't I come to his flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
Playing records, the sounds of groovy hi-fi
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah

My baby loves me, she gets me feelin so fine
And when she loves me, she lets me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is ok
I got the answer, the only thing I could say
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah

We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low so noone can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'd be noone else alive in all the world except for you and me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
It's hard to tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave these others alone
No need to ask me if everything is ok
I've got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah

We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low so noone can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'd be noone else alive in all the world except for you and me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
It's hard to tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave these others alone
No need to ask me if everything is ok
I've got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah
I say yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah
