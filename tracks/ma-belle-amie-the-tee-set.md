Ma Belle Amie
You were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie
Apres tout les beau jours, je te dit merci merci!

You were the answer to all my questions before we were through
I want to tell you, that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by leaving me now to start anew
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you



Let the bells ring, let the birds sing
Let's all give my substitute a big cheer
Let the bells ring
Let the birds sing, for the man after him waits here
For the man after him waits here

Ma Belle Amie, you were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie, it was a time that you thought that your only friend was me

You were the answer to all my questions before we were through
I want to tell you, that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by leaving me now to start anew
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you

Let the bells ring
Let the birds sing, let's all give my substitute a big cheer
Let the bells ring
Let the birds sing, for the man after him waits here
For the man after him waits here

Ma Belle Amie, you were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie, apres tout les beau jours, je te dit merci merci!

You were the answer to all my questions before we were through
I want to tell you, that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by leaving me now to start a new
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you
