I want to ride the tiger 
I want to ride the tiger 
It will be black and white in the dead of night 
Eyes flashing in the clear moonlight 
I want to ride the tiger. 

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man 
Tell you about salt, carbon and water 
But a tear to a chinese man 
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman. 

I want to ride the tiger 
I want to sail through the risin' sun for you and you 
We got something to learn from the other side 
Something to give, we got nothing to hide 
I want to ride the tiger. 

Black wants out of the streets 
Yellow wants the country 
Red wants the country back 
And white wants out of this world 
Sing - sing to the sky 
I want to ride the tiger 
I want to ride the tiger. 

Look to the summer of seventy-five 
All the world is gonna come alive 
Do you want to ride the tiger? 

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man 
Tell you about salt, carbon and water 
But a tear to an oriental man 
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman.
