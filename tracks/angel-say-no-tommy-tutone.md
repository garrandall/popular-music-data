Angel I love you, you know I love you, but what can I say 
You're not really here anymore and I know it
It's getting late they're waiting outside you're gonna run away
One more time, it might be-e too la-a-ate

Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know-ow

Don't try to tell me, baby don't tell me, I already know
You got that look in your eyes that shows me (hey)
I can't take it, I just can't take it, when you start to go-o
Well any American boy would fe-el the same way-ay

Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know-ow

Cause you know I'm right
It's another night
You're gonna take that ride 
(yeah) No no no no!

Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know

Angel say no no no 
(angel don't you know)
Angel say no no no
(angel!)
Angel say no no no
(ah-ee-ah-ee-ah-ee baby don't you want want want want want want)
Angel say no no no 
(angel don't you wan't)
Angel say no no no
(you better run now)
Angel say no no no
(you better run now)
Angel say no no no
(yeah, you better run for your life they're gonna get you babe
they got a needle and a hound
ah-ee-ah-ee-ah-angel say no-o)
Angel say no no
