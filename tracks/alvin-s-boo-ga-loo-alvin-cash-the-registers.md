Alvin's got a boo-ga-loo, baby
Ooh wee

(Alvin's got a boo-ga-loo
Hey, hey, hey
Alvin's got a boo-ga-loo
Hey, hey, hey)

He's got a groove, baby
Get up and move, baby
Move it to the left
Move it to the right, baby

Shake your head
Wiggle your legs, baby

Come on, baby
Ooh wee

(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo
(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo
(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo

Aw, come on here with me, baby

(B double O g-a-l double O)
(B double O g-a-l double O)
(B double O g-a-l double O)
(B double O g-a-l double O)

Aw, come here
Come on, baby, ooh wee

(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo
(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo
(Get it, get it, get it)
A boo-ga-loo

Ooh wee, come on, y'all
Come on, y'all
Aw, have mercy

Get it, baby, woo

(Alvin's got a boo-ga-loo
Hey, hey, hey
Alvin's got a boo-ga-loo
Hey, hey, hey...
