Running hot
Running cold
I was running into overload
That was extreme

I took it so high, so low, so long
There was no where to go like a bad dream


Somehow that wires uncrossed
The table were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn


I'm feeling good from my hat to my shoe
Know where I am going and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I've got a new attitude
I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I got love like I never knew
Ooo, oo, oo, oo
I've got a new attitude

I am wearing a new dress, a new hat
Brand new ideas
As a matter of fact
I've changed for good

Must have been the cold nights, new moon
Night changes
Or forget your love for just being like I should





Ooo, Ooo, Oooo
