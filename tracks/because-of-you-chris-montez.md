Because of you
There's a song in my heart
Because of you
My romance had its start

Because of you, the sun will sun
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever and never to part

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile, oh, just because of you

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile, oh, just because of you

Hey now, I can smile
Mmm, just because of you
