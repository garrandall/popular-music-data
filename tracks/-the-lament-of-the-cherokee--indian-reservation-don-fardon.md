They took the whole Indian nation

Put us on this resevation

Took away our way of life

Tomahawk and the prairie-knife.
Took away our native tongue

Taught their English to our young

And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan.
Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe

So proud you lived
So proud you'll die.

They took the whole Indian nation

Put us on this reservation

Brick built houses by the score

Won't need tepees anymore.
Although they've changed our ways of old

They'll never change our heart and soul

And suddenly when the world has learned

Cherokee Indian will return.
Will return
Will return

Will return
Will return
Will return!
