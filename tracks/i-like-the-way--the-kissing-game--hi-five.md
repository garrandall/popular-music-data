All summer long
We've been together
And I never felt so good
'Cause when I'm with you
You're such a good time (yes, it is)

And when you get next to me
You make my heartbeat fast
You throw me bad when you smile

And when we're alone
I know we're in love
'Cause I can't get enough
'Cause


(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day


We've got it good
We have it all it seems
We're living dream, yeah
This is our time
This wasn't meant to be
Just you and me

This is still new
We're still young in heart
And breaking too
But I know our love will always be there


(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day, baby


Yeah
(I like the)
Keep me looking forward to another day
(I like the)
Another day
(I like the)

Oh, I like
(I like the way)
The way you make me feel, baby
(I like the way)
I like the way, the way you love me, baby


(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day

(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day


(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
Love the way you hold me in your arms
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
Love the way you kiss me, baby
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
I like the way, I like the way
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
I like the way we kiss
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
Let me touch you and squeeze you
(I like the way) I like the way, I like the way
That's all I gotta say
