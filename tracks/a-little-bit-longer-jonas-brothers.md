Got the news today
Doctors said I had to stay
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all be done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And everytime you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know

All this time goes by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
Waitin' on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
You don't know what its like to feel so low.
And everytime you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know, no

And you don't know what you got 'til it's gone.
Don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah!
And everytime you smile you laugh you glow,
You don't even know! yeah! woah!

So I'll wait 'til kingdom come.
All the highs and lows are gone.
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
I'll be...fine
