As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Mabellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' about 95
She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side

Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

Well, the Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
I know that I was doin' my motor good

Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The heat went down, the motor cooled down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill

Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do
