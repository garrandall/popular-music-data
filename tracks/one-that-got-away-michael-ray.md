Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow

Those hungry eyes can't be denied
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way outta my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

She's decorating my car
Soon she'll be breaking my heart
She's too wild horses to be all mine
I'll be your beast to burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kinda label
She's into leaving those strings untied
Keeping it tax free under the table
She might only be mine tonight

But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I ain't gonna sit here and overthink it
I got a tiger by the tail
I'll just smile when she sinks her teeth in
She'll leave a scar and a story to tell

She's decorating my car
Soon she'll be breaking my heart
She's too wild horses to be all mine
I'll be your beast to burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kinda label
She's into leaving those strings untied
Keeping it tax free under the table
She might only be mine tonight

But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

Hey, hey
Bees gonna sting me but damn it I want it
Hey, hey
Honey so sweet in that moment

She's decorating my car
Soon she'll be breaking my heart
She's too wild horses to be all mine
I'll be your beast to burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kinda label
She's into leaving those strings untied
Keeping it tax free under the table
She might only be mine tonight

But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
Yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away)

Hey (yeah) hey (yeah, yeah)
Hey (yeah) hey (yeah, yeah)
