If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Cause baby, baby, my time is much too expensive
And I don't want no little boy

But if you, if you are serious
Don't go playing with my heart, it makes me furious
And if want me to love you
Ooo baby, I will, oo yeah I will

Tell it like it is
Oh yeah, just let your conscience be your guide
You know, deep down inside
I believe you love me, just forget your foolish pride

I think life's too short for all this sorrow
We might be here today and gone tomorrow
I might as well just get what I want
I wanna live, I wanna live

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed now let your conscience be your guide
Ooo yeah deep down inside
I believe you love me, just forget your foolish pride
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
