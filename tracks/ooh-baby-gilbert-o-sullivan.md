Ooh baby your love is so bad
You baby you're driving me mad
Ooh baby your kiss is so sweet
You baby knock me off my feet
Ooh baby I wish you were mine
Ooh baby we'd have a good time
Ooh what can I do

Ooh baby whatever you've got
You baby you're making me hot
Ooh baby my temperature is high
Ooh baby a hundred and five
Ooh baby I think that you'll find
Ooh baby I'm out of my mind
Ooh what can I do

I wish that there was some way
I could have you to myself
Wish I didn't have to share you
With anyone else (share you)
With anyone else (share you)

Ooh baby wherever you are
You baby will you be my star
Ooh baby I'm begging you please
Ooh baby down on my knees
Ooh baby why don't you say yes
Ooh baby I'll give you my best
Ooh what can I do

I wish that there was some way
I could have you to myself
Wish I didn't have to share you
With anyone else (share you)
With anyone else (share you)

Ooh baby your love is so bad
You baby you're driving me mad
Ooh baby your kiss is so sweet
You baby knock me off my feet
Ooh baby I wish you were mine
Ooh baby we'd have a good time
Ooh--what can I do
