Oh baby your love is so bad
You baby you're driving me mad
Oh baby your kiss is so sweet
You baby knock me off my feet
Oh baby I wish you were mine
Oh baby we'd have a good time
Oh what can I do

Oh baby whatever you've got
You baby you're making me hot
Oh baby my temperature is high
Oh baby a hundred and five
Oh baby I think that you'll find
Oh baby I'm out of my mind
Oh what can I do

I wish that there was some way
I could have you to myself
Wish I didn't have to share you
With anyone else (share you)
With anyone else (share you)

Oh baby wherever you are
You baby will you be my star
Oh baby I'm begging you please
Oh baby down on my knees
Oh baby why don't you say yes
Oh baby I'll give you my best
Oh what can I do

I wish that there was some way
I could have you to myself
Wish I didn't have to share you
With anyone else (share you)
With anyone else (share you)

Oh baby your love is so bad
You baby you're driving me mad
Oh baby your kiss is so sweet
You baby knock me off my feet
Oh baby I wish you were mine
Oh baby we'd have a good time
Oh--what can I do
