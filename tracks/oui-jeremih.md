Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah...

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(truth is) they can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine...


If we tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate is warm long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

See my baby know, where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know when I'm next to her for sure
It's like you on my mind all day, get this off my chest
I think I know I love you, I swear your shit the best
Friends, they know they hate, Get this off my chest uh
Ah yea, I think I love you, oh baby maybe


If we tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate is warm long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

Oh, da du du du du
Oh, da du du du du
Oh, da du du du du
Oh, da du du du du


If we tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate is warm long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don't mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
