We're on the shores of nowhere, looking out to sea
I turn and kiss your face and you laugh at me
You laugh at me


How do I feel? Well I feel like rain
Feel like saying
It feels so good, so right
To be with tonight


(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right) hight
(To be with you tonight)


There is no space between the ocean, you, and me
Exchanging life force as we live and breath
Together we'll be


How do I feel when I feel like being
Feel like singing
Feels so good, so right
To be with you tonight


(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right) hight
(To be with you-ou)


(Oowee oowee ohoohhoh)
(Oowee oowee ohoohhoh)


You make me feel so young, the way you laugh and play
Like a child in the sun, you know I wanna stay-ay
In lo-ove this way


How do I feel when I feel like praying
(Fee-ee-eel like saying) whoaa
Feels so good, so right
To beeeee with you


(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right)
Hey baby (oohooh)
(So good, so right)
You know it feels so goo-ood, ahhhahhhhh
(So good, so right)
You know it feels so good
Uh-huh
(To be with you tonight) uh-huh
(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
(So good, so right)
(To be with you tonight)
