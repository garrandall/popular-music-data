I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
