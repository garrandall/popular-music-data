Lets get together and do what comes naturally

I've been holding back my love for such a long time
Nobody's come along that I would want to call mine
My phone's been ringing but my heart it just won't answer
I can't pretend cause it's love I'm after

I've been lookin'
I was not prepared for what I saw in your eyes
I saw something I've been looking for a long time
Lets get together
We just me but I know that you're no stranger
I can tell that my hearts in danger


I've been lookin' for you
You've been lookin' for me
Lets get together and do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Lets get together and do what comes naturally

I could play hard to get but what good would that do me
You'd look into my eyes and you would see right through me
This is a powerful feeling that were feelin'
I can't deny its my heart you're stealin'

I've been lookin'
I want to tell you now, I am not afraid
I'll let the walls come down, tonight I'm feelin' brave
Been lookin' for you
You've been lookin' for me, you've been lookin' for me
Baby set your love free, set your love free
Lets get together and do what comes naturally
