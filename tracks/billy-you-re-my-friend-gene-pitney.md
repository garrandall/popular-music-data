Billy you're my friend
Let me tell you what I saw
I saw you in the park
Walking mysteriously in the dark
When I looked again
I saw you weren't alone Bill
You had a girl by your side
Was then I realized she was mine
I was hurt
Eyes could not believe what they saw
Ears could not believe what they heard
But they just bent with every word they heard
It's absurd cos
Billy you're my friend
We grew up together
How could you do this to me
Billy you're my friend
Now that I've told you what I saw
I think I'll be on my way
There seems to be nothing more to say
Billy you're my friend
