Theres nothing I wouldn't do
Anything you want me to
Can't keep my hands off you

When you hold me in your arms
You rock my body with your charms
And I just don't give a darn
My heartbeat

I don't see you everyday
But in my own little way
Oh, I love you

Oh, it really makes me wanna freak
Our love is so sweet
Sweet enough to eat
My love is complete
Oh for the one I love

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Your sweet make me freak
Heartbeat
Makes me feel so weak

When you hear my little fears
Why my sad and lonely tears
Haven't felt so good in years
My heartbeat

Those dark and lonely nights
I wish with all my might
Ohto have you, yeah
Now I'm here all alone
Im waiting here by the phone
To have you

Oh
It really makes me wanna freak
Oh It's so sweet
Sweet enough to eat my heartbeat
Our love is so sweet
Just for the one I love

My heartbeat
Sweet
Make me weak
Yeah yeah
Sweet your sweetness
Makes you my freak
Yeah
My heartbeat for the one I love

Now you know this don't make no kind of sense
Walking around here so intense
You make my heartbeat
You make me feel so weak

Moving all around
From my head to the ground
You make my heartbeat
You make me feel so weak
Cause everything you said
Went right straight through my head

Oh
So weak
My heartbeat
Oh, oh, my heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak

Lying here all alone
Waiting by the phone
Don't make no kind of sense
Feeling this intense

Your sweet makes me weak
Weak weak, oh..
Just give your love all of
My love
