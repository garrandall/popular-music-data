Shades of scarlet in your smile
How was I
Supposed to resist, those looks you don't try to hide

A look of passion in your eyes
It feels like oxygen has disappeared and been
Replaced by pure desire

How long will I wait?
I can give you a life time
Forever and a day
Least until my heartbeat flat lines
I will be right here waiting
How long will I wait?
As long as it takes

Feel my senses catch on fire
With every glance gone unanswered
I'm doubting my chances
I just want you to
Hold me close tiny dancer

Feel like I'm walking on a wire
But gravity
Don't mean nothing
This artful seduction
Is drawing us closer
With every touch and my
Heart beats faster

How long will I wait?
I can give you a life time
Forever and a day
Least until my heartbeat flat lines
I will be right here waiting
How long will I wait?
As long as it takes

How long will I wait?
I can give you a life time
Forever and a day
Least until my heartbeat flat lines
I will be right here waiting
How long will I wait?
As long as it takes
How long will I wait?
As long as it takes
