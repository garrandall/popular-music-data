There were times, I remember
Had to fight just to hold my head up
Those times when even my friends
Tried to make a fool of me
There were things that my heart attacked
That they just couldn't see

Some said, 'I was hopeless
Mind tangled in the night'
Strong hearts just keep goin'
That is why I'm still standing here today

Come together, raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life wont go away
I'll sing forever here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm
I'm so glad, I'm standing here today

If your lost in your troubles
And the world just seems to forget you
If you remember sunshine
Even on your darkest day
Just follow what your heart says
And you will find the way

Some said 'I was hopeless
Mind tangled in the night'
Strong hearts just keep goin'
That is why I'm still standing here today

Come together, raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life wont go away
I'll sing forever here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm
I'm so glad, I'm standing here today

Come together, raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life it wont go away
I'll sing forever here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm
I'm so glad, I'm standing here today

I've lived to see the sun break through the dawn
And I'm so glad I'm standing here today
