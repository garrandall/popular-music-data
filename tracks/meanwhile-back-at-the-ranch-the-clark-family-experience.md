Traffic jams, commuter lines
Monthly quotas, the daily grind
In a hurry and out of time
The pressure's on
They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge


Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Sitting on the front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche
Meanwhile, back at the ranch
The big computer's on the blink
Y2K, what a stink
They bring the city to the brink
But not out here
The only thing that we got on line
Is the fish we caught for suppertime
Well, let me tell you, peace of mind
Is the last frontier
They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge


Out there crawling
Like ants upon the ground
Oh, go home
Hear them calling
But the sky is falling
Down, down, down, down, down
Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Sitting on my front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche
