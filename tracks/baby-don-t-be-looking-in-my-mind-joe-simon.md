Baby don't you try to look in my mind, oh no
You might not, might not like what you find, oh no
Oh honey I know you, I know you better than you think I do
So don't, don't you try to look in my mind


I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
On and on
Yes I am
If I didn't, didn't love you
Honey I'd be gone
So don't try to change the way that I live
Let me tell you
You're gonna stay home and take all of the sweet loving I got to give
That's what you're gonna do


Don't expect all my happy thoughts to be of you
Yeah let me tell ya, you know I'm a man
And men, men got things to do, oh yeah
Baby I'm proud, girl I'm proud to be your man, oh yeah
I'm gonna give you all of the loving that I can , oh yeah


Baby, don't, don't try to look in my mind, oh no
You don't have to worry, oh no
You don't have to stand there with your head hanging down low
Baby, you don't have to cry, 'cause I love you baby
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love it
I always will
You don't have to worry baby
