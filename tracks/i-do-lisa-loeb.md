When I'm done with thinking
Then I'm done with you
And when I'm done with crying
And then I'm done with you
When I feel so tired
Then I'm done with you

You know, everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I do

You're trying to convince me
That what I've done's not right
And I get so frustrated
I stay up every night
You ask me for an answer
And I'm so tired and I'm up in the air, I'm up in the air

You know, everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way (Everybody feels this way)

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way
Just because you say

I will be ignored and I will be denied
And I could be erased, I could be brushed aside
And I will get scared and I will get shoved down
But I feel like I do because you push me around

I'm starting to ignore you
Now, I doubted you so long
I'm tired of over-thinking
I know you don't belong
Now I'm asking questions
No one pushes me around

You know, everybody feels this ways sometimes
Everybody feels this way (Everybody feels this way)

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You don't seem angry, but I do
I do (I do)
I do (I do)
I do (I do)

You don't seem angry, but I do
You don't hear it, but I do
I, I do
You can't hear it, but I do
I do (I do)
You don't seem angry, but I do
I do (I do)
You don't hear it, but I do
