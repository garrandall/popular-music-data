Why am I losing sleep over you?
Reliving precious moments we knew

So many days have gone by
Still I'm so lonely and I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

Within the prison walls of my mind
There's still apart of you left behind
And though it hurts I'll get by
Without your loving yet I guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
