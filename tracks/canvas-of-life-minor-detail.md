I used to be the kind of guy
Who let this life pass him by
Never thinking I must live it my way
Holding back, waiting for someone else to take me through

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas

Today I shape things differently
I don't waste my time so foolishly
In my heart there's a need to be and do
I've got my life it's up to me
To see it through

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas

Tomorrow is a bright new day
I'll take decisions, have my say
I'll be what I wanna be
I want my spirit to be free
I'll direct my life to my own goals
I'll go it my way and be what I must be

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)

Never knowing I could shape my life
Like an artist paints his dreams on the canvas
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
(Just like the artists paints a picture on the canvas of life)
