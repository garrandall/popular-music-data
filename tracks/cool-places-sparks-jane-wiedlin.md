I wanna got to cool places with you
I wanna take you cool places tonight
I wanna go where nobody's a fool
And no one says uh, "Hey girl, need a light?"
I want to move like this and that
A minimum of chit chat
I never wanna cool down, cool down, cool cool cool
Cool places tonight

I gotta tell you, you're lookin' real good
They let us in so I'm feelin' all right
I like to go where sometimes they refuse
Yeah, I remember last Saturday night
But I'm feeling cooler now
And they could tell we're cooler now
It's obvious we're cooler now, cooler now, cool cool cool
Cool places tonight

I wanna go, I wanna go
I want to go to cool places tonight
I wanna go to cool places with you

And after that we'll slip out for a bite
A coffee shop, and toast, coffee and juice
And then we'll sleep 'til 5 PM
And start it up all over again
I never want to cool down, cool down, cool cool cool

I wanna go, I wanna go
I want to go to cool places tonight
I wanna go to cool places with you
