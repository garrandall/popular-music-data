Louie, Louie whoa baby 
Say we gotta go 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Louie, Louie, oh baby 
Say we gotta go 

Fine little boy he waits for me 
He gets his fill, oh constantly 
Seen him playin' round 'bout an hour ago 
He's never without I'm waitin' at home 

Louie, Louie, whoa baby 
Say we gotta go 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Louie, Louie, oh baby 
Say we gotta go 

Every night at ten I see him again 
I think of him oh constantly 
Goin' anywhere and he takes me there 
Goin' down the road right in his ear 

Louie, Louie, oh baby 
Say we gotta go 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say Louie, Louie, oh baby 
Say we gotta go 

All right!

Meet my maker, I know my part 
It won't be long, please touch my heart 
Take him in my arms again 
Dug her eyes, they never leave you again 

Say, Louie, Louie, whoa baby 
Say we gotta go 
Yeah, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea 
Louie, Louie, oh baby 
Say we gotta go 

Say we gotta go now 
Yeah, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
We gotta go now

Louie, Louie, oh baby
We gotta go now
