In the morning when you wake up
You've got planes flying in the sky
Flying bombs made to break up
All the lies in your eyes


There's a man says
He can put an end to war


They shot George Wallace down
He'll never walk around
Our mines are sleeping in the sea
Blow those bridges down
And burn that jungle down
And kill those Vietnamese
