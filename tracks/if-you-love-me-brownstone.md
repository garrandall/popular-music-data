I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare


You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark


If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it


You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go


You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark


If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
Prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it


Oh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love, all around you honey
And if you care, you gotta show it baby
True love to share

Show it
Prove it


Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
