We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right (off right)
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

Ashanti


Ah-ah-ah...


I fucked around and made a buncha fuck around money
Now I feel like foul money
I'm fuckin' awesome, to awesome have a child for me
Got homies who ain't comin' home 'til the cows coming
Niggas with power, they tryna press our power buttons
Now baby make that ass clap like it's proud of me
She said I will like 'ill with an apostrophe
Its Lil Tunechi, word around on the streets
That everything is workin' out like obliques, they wanna see it obese
You drive me crazy you gon crash the vert
Get out my business why you act like a clerk
I gotta white girl she call me names like bastard and jerk
When I send her ass back to the 'burbs
Fucked her right good night, die wit' em open
I'm with a big booty bitch dressed inappropriate
Cocaine, baking soda and some hot water
Kept the feinds comin' back to me, not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow, keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment
This a Mannie Fresh beat, I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barak homies
Your homeboys tired of me, I hope they die yawnin'
Leave ya house haunted
I ain't kiddin', I ain't playin', fuck up your house party
Lil Tunechi


So DJ, won't you play some more songs?
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah, we ain't got nowhere to go but wrong
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So DJ, won't you play some more songs?
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah, we ain't got nowhere to go but wrong
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Got you Ashanti)


Just a watch and a mink coat, yeah
Wherever I spit at a tree grow
I'm a blood with some C-notes
And I'm getting more checks than a peep hole
Yo, I done been through hell and back on a steamboat
Met the devil, came back feeling frigo
Gang bangin', tatted up like latinos
And since I'm on my Spanish shit, it's Carter cinco
Mommy is bionic and bisexual, bilingual
Mommy is a goddess, but she gotta let her wings show
Mommy tryna fuck me with her team, that's a team sport
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen yours
Muscle car look like I just got out the bin whoa
Drop the top smell like I just opened the weed store
A nice beat mixed with Tunechi like a cream float
With Mannie Fresh the O.G
Now it's a G yo


Ah-ah-ah...
Yeah, got the squad in this bitch in case it pop off
Ah-ah-ah...
Fresh, can you please tell these niggas I've been rich since the Hot Boys
Ah-ah-ah...
Bad ass dog by the screen door
Ah-ah...
Your girl walkin' 'round my house when I'm in in my watch and my mink coat
Ah-ah-ah...
Yeah, now everybody throw a 5, throw a 5, Carter cinco
Ah-ah-ah...
And since I'm on my Spanish shit, them other boys Finito


(Ah-ah-ah...)
We gon' start this shit off right
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
(Ah-ah-ah...)
We gon' start this shit off right (yeah)
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
(Ah-ah-ah...)
We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
Bitches outside, them some sad ass bitches
Leggo (leggo, yeah, leggo, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We got some bass bitches, some bad ass bitches
In the restroom in the mirror taking pictures, alright, yeah
That's alright, yeah
That's alright, yeah
That's alright, yeah


We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
Couple niggas trippin', mean muggin', makin' fistses, alright
It's alright, but we don't fight, no
Welcome
