We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know

We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Them bitches outside is some sad ass bitches
I know (leggo, leggo, leggo)
And I know, I know (I know, I know, I know)

I fucked around and made a bunch of fuck around money
Now I feel like found money
I'm fuckin awesome too awesome have a child for me
Got homies who ain't comin' home 'til the cows coming
Niggas with power tryna press our power buttons
Now baby make that ass clap like it's
Proud of me
She said I will like ill with an apostrophe
Its Lil Tunechi word around on the streets
That everything is workin' out like obliques?
They wanna see it obese

You drive me crazy you gon crash the Vert
Get out my business why you act like a clerk
I gotta white girl she call me names like bastard and jerk
That's when I send her ass back to the 'burbs
Fucked her right good night, die with 'em open
I'm with a big booty bitch dressed inappropriate
Cocaine baking soda and some hot water
Kept the feinds comin' back not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like ill be off tomorrow

Keep the Glock on him
All eyes on me I had a Pac moment
This the homie fresh beat I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barak homies
Your homeboys tired of me I hope they die yawnin'
Leave ya house haunted
I ain't kiddin'
I ain't playin'
Fuck up your house party
Lil Tunechi

So DJ won't you play some more songs
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah we ain't got nowhere to go but roll (woah, yeah)

So DJ won't you play some more songs
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah we ain't got nowhere to go but roll (woah, yeah)

Just a watch and a mink coat
Wherever I spit at a tree grows
I'm a blood with some C notes
And I'm getting more checks than the peephole, yeah

Yeah, I done been to hell and back on a steamboat
Met the devil came back feeling freego
Gang banging tatted up like latinos
And since I'm almost Spanish it is Carter cinco
Mommy is bionic and bisexual, bilingual
Mommy is a goddess but she gotta let her wings show
Mommy tried to fuck me with her team, that's a team sport
All these bad bitches in this bitch but I ain't seen yours
Muscle car look like it just got out the bingo
Drop the top smells like I just opened a Wii store
A nice beat mixed with Tunechi like a clean flow
Many firsts OG now it's a GO

Got the squad in this bitch 'cause I pop off
Fresh can you please tell these niggas I been rich since the I4
Bad ass dog by the screen door
Your girl walking round my house
While wearing a watch and a mink coat, yeah
Now everybody throw a 5, throw a 5, Carter cinco
And since I'm on the Spanish
Hit the murder boyz finito

We gon start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We gon' start this shit off right
We got some badass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some badass bitches in the house tonight

We got some badass bitches, badass bitches
Them bitches outside these some sad ass bitches
I know (leggo, leggo, leggo)

We got some badass bitches, badass bitches
In the restroom in the mirror taking pictures, alright, alright
Bitches outside these some sad ass bitches
Couple niggas trippin, mean mugging, making faces
It's alright, alright, we don't fight
Welcome
