Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recongize anyone there

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us

I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us

As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder 
Who will we be ten years from now

That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh that used to be us
That used to be us
That used to be us
