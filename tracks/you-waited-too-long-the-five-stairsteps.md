Do-oo-oo-oo

Hello love, nice to see you again
I hope some day we can still be friends
I know this line won't help you feel better
But a love you don't see just can't last forever

You've waited too long (You waited too long)
I knew I was wrong (You waited too long)

The day we parted I was so broken-hearted
All I could do ws thing of you and how I love started
You said some day you would return
And that's why my heart contined to burn

But you've waited too long (You waited too long)
I couldn't go on (You waited too long)

Now that I've found myself another girl (Tell me all about it)
And she loves me with all her heart (Let me hear you shout it)
To me she's all I need (All I need)
To make a brand new start (mmm)

For you've waited too long (do-oo-oo-oo)
I couldn't go on (do-oo-oo-oo)
