Bangkok - Oriental setting
And the city don't know
What the city is getting
The creme de la creme of
The chess world in a show
With everything
But Yul Brynner
Times flies -
Doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa
Had the chess boys in it
All change - don't you know that when you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or...
Or this place!


One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me


One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore
It's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddya mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea girls
Warm and sweet (warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every moves's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine


One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me


Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddah
And thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate
I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors


One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me
