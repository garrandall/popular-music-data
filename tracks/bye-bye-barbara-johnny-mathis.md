Never more to hurt me deep
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

Never more to make me weep
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

I have gone in the search of
A much truer love than your own

I'll find me one who understands
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

Holds my heart in tender hands
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

I have gone in the search of
A much truer love than I've known
(Bye, bye Barbara)

Just read my note on your door
Just goodbye
Nothing more

It's better to leave you this way
You couldn't change
I couldn't stay

Never more to hurt me deep
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

Never more to make me weep
Bye, bye Barbara
(Bye, bye Barbara)

Since you are what you are
You'll not very long be alone
(Bye, bye Barbara, bye, bye Barbara)

I have gone in the search
Of a much truer love than your own
(Bye, bye Barbara)
