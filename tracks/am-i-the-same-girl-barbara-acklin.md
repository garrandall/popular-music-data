Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know

Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Who knew her soul

I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet

Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know

Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Who knew her soul

I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet

But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
