If you want my loving
Come on and get yourself some
Don't be ashamed
I need a woman
You need a man
Come on and get yourself some don't restrain

Love is a special emotion
Makes your body lose control
A simple touch can cause an explosion
Make your love juice overflow

I got what you need
You got what I want
So baby let's stop wasting time
Oh just relax
Girl stop holding back
We got the same thing in mind

Oh
If you want my loving
Come on and get yourself some
Don't be ashamed
I need a woman
You need a man
Come on and get yourself some don't restrain

Come on and get yourself some
Don't be ashamed

Get it
Get yourself some
Get you some
I want some
Gimme some
Come on and gimme some
Gimme some

I know
A woman's got pride
But when you need to be satisfied
Don't be ashamed of your desires
Let's make this thing complete
Let us use body heat
Aw let's start us a fire

If you want my loving
Come on and get yourself some
Don't be ashamed
I need a woman
You need a man
Come on and get yourself some don't restrain

Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it right now
I want somebody
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it right now
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it right now
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it right
