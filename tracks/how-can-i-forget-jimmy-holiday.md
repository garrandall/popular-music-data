I want to know know know
(How can I forget)
I got to know know know
(How can I forget)
How can I forget?

When I was lonely
She'd shake away the blues
When I was down and out
She even bought me shoes

So tell me tell me tell me
(How can I forget)
How how how?
(How can I forget)
How can I forget?
(Forget her)

Yesterday she left me
For somebody new
My friends all say, "Forget her
Go out and do the same thing too"

How?
When her kiss
My lips
And my cheek
Fingertips
Since she been gone
I can't sleep at night
And since she been gone
Can't see the light

Oh tell me tell me tell me
(How can I forget)
How? how? how?
(How can I forget)
How can I forget?
(How can I forget)

Oh! oh! how!
(How can I forget)
How can I forget?
(How can I forget)
How can I forget?
(How can I forget)

Oh! oh oh!

How?
(How can I forget)
