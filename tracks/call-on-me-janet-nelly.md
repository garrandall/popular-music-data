I don't know if I've ever felt like this before
But I'm sure that the way I feel, I don't want it to go
'Cuz I've cried my share of tears
And I've sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do


So baby, call on me
Whether day or night, I'll never leave

See you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby just pick up the phone and call on me

So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go


See I never met a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime that she's around
I be posted, waitin' on standby
Lookin' to catch the hint
I'm doin' whatever, whenever
Never forget I said I'd be here when you want
To get what you need, if you wanna recieve
Oh, please believe you could


Call on me whether day or night
I'll never leave

See you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby just pick up the phone and call on me

So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go


Call on me
When ya need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there
I can meet you anywhere
Call on me
Anytime that you please
Babe, whatever you want
Be whatever you need
Because you're the one I love baby, yeah


Call on me whether day or night
I'll never leave

See you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby just pick up the phone and call on me

So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go, mama


It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to


It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do


It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
