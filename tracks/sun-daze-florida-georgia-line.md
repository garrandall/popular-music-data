Alright
Make you wanna dance. Don't it, baby?

I'm gonna wear my flip-flops
And I'm gonna play some flip-cup
And
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger

And throw a 20 on a cornhole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going
That keg gon' be floatin'

All I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades
And get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for

And all I wanna do is lace my Js
And lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

Girl, you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley

I'll sit you up on the kitchen sink
And stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feeling
We gone by this evening

But all I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades
And get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for

And all I wanna do is lace my Js
And lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

Take 'em out to the sticks, boys. C'mon

All I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades
And get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for

And all I wanna do is lace my Js
And lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
