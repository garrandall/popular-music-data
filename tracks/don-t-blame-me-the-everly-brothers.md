Don't blame me, for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell, but how can I help - it
Don't blame me

Can't you see, when you do the things you do
If I can't conceal, the thrill that I'm feel - ing
Don't blame me

I can't help it, if that dog-goned - moon above
Makes me need, someone like you - to love

Blame your kiss, as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms, that melt in my arms
But don't blame me
