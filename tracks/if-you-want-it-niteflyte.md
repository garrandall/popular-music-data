If you want it you can get it
With your love
If you want it you can get it
With your love
I had a feeling that I met you
Some place before
I had a feeling that I wanted you
Deep inside my soul
When I saw your face just smiling back at me
I knew no other could ever take your place
If I want you to be part of my life
I gotta this way starting today
If you want it (Oh, if you want it, baby) you can get it
With your love (Say wit' your love, yeah)
If you want it you can get it
With your love
No matter how much time it takes you
To feel my love
I got a feeling that you'll want me too
Beside your soul, whoa... Oh... Ho... Whoa... Oh... Ho...
When you feel this way, if you think it's just a game
Don't be affected by the things that people say
Just try to believe the magic of fate
We gotta this way starting today
If you want it you can get it (Say just believe)
With your love (In the magic of fate)
If you want it (Anything that you want, baby) you can get it
With your love (Oh, with your love, with your love, with your love)
If you want it (If you want it you can have it) you can get it (You can get it)
With your love (Oh... Whoa... Ho... Ho... Ho...)
If you want it (Just take your time, baby) you can get it
With your love (With your love I say hey, hey)
If you want it you can get it (Oh)
With your love (With your love) (Say with your love)
If you want it (Oh, whoa) you can get it
With your love
If you want it you can get it
