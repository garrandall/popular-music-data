They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
They're I love you drops
Cause I love you
(Cause I love you)

They were on my pillow
When I woke up this morning
They were on the letter
I tried all day to write

And, just a little while ago
I saw them falling
On your picture
As I kissed it goodnight

I love you drops
I miss you drops
Hurry home drops
You've been gone so long drops

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome
And I love you
(And I love you)

Never knew this heart could
Hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many
Lifetimes in a week

Why don't you come back to me
The way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals
Off my cheek

I love you drops
I miss you drops
Hurry home drops
You've been gone so long drops

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome
And I love you
(I love you)

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome
And I love you
