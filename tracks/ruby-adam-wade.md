(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)

They say
Ruby
You're like a dream
Not always what you seem

And though my heart
May break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know
Ruby, it's you

They say
Ruby
You're like a song
You don't know right from wrong

And in your eyes
I see heartaches for me
But from the start
Who stole my heart
Ruby
It's you

I hear your voice
And I must come to you
I have no choice
What else can I do?

They say
Ruby
You're like a flame
Into my life
You came

And though I should beware
Still I don't care
You thrill me so
I only know
Ruby
It's you
