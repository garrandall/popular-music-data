(Wishful, wishful wishful, wishful)
You don't believe in me
But I believe in you
Those promises you made
I'll never hold you to
Wishful thinking we could start aknew

(Wishful, wishful wishful, wishful)
Those things we used to do
You do with someone new
You don't confide in me
But I confide in you
Wishful thinking we could start aknew

Don't you know I miss you
Since we've been apart
You're no longer in my arms
Still you're in my heart

(Wishful, wishful wishful, wishful)
No matter what may be
You know that this is true
You don't belong to me
But I belong to you
Wishful thinking we could start aknew

(Wishful, wishful wishful, wishful)
Wishful thinking we could start aknew
(Wishful, wishful wishful, wishful)
