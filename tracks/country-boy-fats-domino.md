Have you heard the story
Of a little country boy
He is always happy and full of joy
Nothing in this world
That he's thinking of
All he really cares for
Is the one he loves
And the moon above
Stars above
Heaven above
That is all he thinking of
Now you heard my story
Darling can't you see
That little country boy
Happens to be me

Have you heard the story
Of the little country boy
He is always happy and full of joy
Nothing in this world
That he's thinking of
All he really cares for
Is the one he love
And the moon above
Stars above
Heaven above
That is all he's thinking of
Now you heard my story
Darling can't you see
That little country boy
Happens to be me
