I said, shotgun
Shoot 'em 'fore he runs, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the jerk, now
Hey!

Put on yo' red dress
And then you go downtown, now
I said, buy yourself a shotgun, now
We gonna break it down, baby, now
We gonna load it up, baby, now
A-then you shoot him 'fore he run, now

I said, shotgun
Shoot 'em 'fore he run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the jerk, now
Hey!

Shotgun
Shoot 'em 'fore he run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the jerk, now
Yeah!
