I think I wanna feel ya
I just wanna thrill ya
Girl, gotta make ya mine

I just wanna shake you
I think I'm going to take you out
Tryin' to blow my mind

I just wanna hold ya
Gotta get to know ya
Dream about ya all the time

I know I'm kinda foolish
Gotta try to cool it
But girl, you blow my mind
Oh, that's why I'm

Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time

If you would only listen
Baby, stop resistin'
Open up and let me in

I don't want to control you
Baby, let me show you
Ohh, I play to win

Don't you think I'm serious
Baby, not mysterious
About the way you make me feel

Ya got my body burnin'
Baby, you got me yearnin'
'Cause girl, you give me chills
Woo, that's why I'm

Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time

Don't know just what to do
You make me lose my cool
Hey, pretty girls help me out

You've got me on my knees
Baby please
Yeah girl, you rock the house, come on

Tryin' to tell you 'bout a girl I know
Come on girl, you've got to let it go
Aww, everybody knows

Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time

I just wanna hold ya
Gotta get to know ya
Dream about ya all the time

People think I'm crazy
I don't think just maybe
I'm about to lose my mind

I want you to make me
Rock me, baby, shake me
Honey baby, take me high

Don't you know I want to
Hug and kiss and love you?
But girl, you make me cry
Woo, woo, woo

Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
I'm crazy, crazy
Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time

Girl, baby

Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
Crazy, crazy
Crazay, crazay for you
Crazay for you all the time
