Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Flashing through the night in my memory
I'm out of control, burning like a flame
You're like a tidal wave crashing over me

Just like kerosene, you lit me up, set me free
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Met you downtown in the winter snow
Now I got your love, can't let it go
You said, "stop playing it safe, girl, I wanna see you lose control"

Just like kerosene, you lit me up, set me free
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
Baby look what you've done, never forget your name
Promise I meant it when I said

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never be the same
I'm saying it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one look at you, I knew I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
