Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded baby
Why can't I see you tonight?

And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?

And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain't the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah I'm blue

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around

The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe
Whoa, hands on the clock
Just don't seem to stop when I'm thinking it over
Whoa, tired of the light
I just don't seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Whoa, I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be
I've got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I've got to get all

Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you baby
It's all a terrible mess

I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah
Light of the love that I found

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
