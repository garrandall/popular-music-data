Just when we think we conquered it
It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us
That get harder and harder and harder
And harder and harder to remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Let's not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper and deeper and deeper
And deeper, and deeper by the minute

But we let it slip away
'Cause we don't know a good thing while we're in it

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

"Y el amor que sentimos es mas profundo" ("The love that we feel is deeper")
