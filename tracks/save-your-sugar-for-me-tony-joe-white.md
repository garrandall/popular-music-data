See you in the hall room
Meet you after school
Laying in your backyard
Uh the grass is cool
Laying on our backs now
Looking at the sky
No words have passed between us
We say it with our eyes

Save your sugar for me, Save your sugar for me
Save your sugar for me, I'll save my sugar for you

And down in the swamps now
Running through the woods
Splashing in the water
Uh it feels so good
Witches hair are shining
Hanging of the trees
You begin to shiver
I hold you close to me

Save your sugar for me, Save your sugar for me
Save your sugar for me, I'll save my sugar for you

Midnight start to falling
I've got to get you home
You know I hate to go now
But we've been gone too long
Sneak you in your window
Kiss you through the screen
See you in the morning
I'll love you in my dreams

Save your sugar for me, Save your sugar for me
Save your sugar for me, I'll save my sugar for you
