So you are a star, okay
Nobody knows you like I do
And you will go far, okay
Nobody knows you like I do
You've got to love only me
You've got to feel only me
'Cause nobody knows you
Nobody shows you the way
But I do

So you are a star, they say
Nobody knows you like I do
And you play the part, okay
Nobody knows you like I do
You've got to love only me
You've got to feel only me
'Cause nobody knows you
Nobody shows you the way
But I do

I close my eyes
Thinking about, 'bout tomorrow
And then I cry
Is no one here to shed a tear for you

So you are a star, oh yeah
Nobody knows you like I do

And know you are okay
Nobody knows you like I do
You've got to love only me
You've got to feel only me

'Cause nobody knows you
Nobody shows you the way
The way
Nobody knows you this way
