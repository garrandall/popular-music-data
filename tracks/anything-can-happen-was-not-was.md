She took me in the bedroom
To show me her computer
She asked me if I liked it
I told her she was cuter
She wasn't that great
But it was getting kind of late

She talked about her father
Said he never really liked her
She said that she'd been married
To a schizophrenic biker
I thought I'd say goodbye
But then I saw her start to cry

We danced by the light of her video screen
She looked me in the eyes and said "Why me?"

On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall
With all of the people yelling and clapping
Anything can happen, anything at all

She drove a baby blue Ferrari
She was all silk and diamonds
Living at the top, no need for social climbing
I asked her for a ride
She said "Right here by my side"
We went to her place overlooking the bay
She said "There's just one bed
Would that be okay?"

On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall
With all of the people yelling and clapping
Anything can happen, anything at all

Successful romance comes when you leave it up to chance
There's nothing you can do
When the fire burns low and your heart turns cold
It comes to you out of the blue

On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall
With all of the people yelling and clapping
Anything can happen, anything at all
