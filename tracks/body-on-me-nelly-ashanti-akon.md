The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the mornin'
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me


Hey boy, I think I just might wanna come see you tonight
And you can have your way boy
I know it's been awhile since you made my body right
Now I been waitin' patiently, anticipating you and me
And it ain't no question', cause boy I love it
When you put that body on me


The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the mornin'
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me


Hey, how you doin' mama? I need to know your name
You givin' me the eye-eye, I'm givin' you the same
It just hit me right now, what we should do today
Go tell your friends bye-bye, and let's go hop a plane
It's no mistakin', the attraction's ironic
I wanna make you someone more than just a bone in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done tripped
You say you short this month, and you late on your rent
He took your car, what you mean, homeless? Yayyayi.
You see, lil mama outta control and I'm just sayin'


The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the mornin'
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me


Now I see you lookin' at my body babe, and now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you, could you promise me that you could make it feel like it never did
Cause I see, and you see, now if I please, could you please?
Now I ain't the one in no relationship, and I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it 


The way that you walkin', the way that you talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the mornin'
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Lovin' that body on me

Hey, hey, hey aye ohh
Gimme that body, babe
Gimme that body, babe
Gimme that body, baby, yeah
