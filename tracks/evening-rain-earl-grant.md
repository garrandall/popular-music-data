I see the evening rain
Against my window pane
And yet my window pane is dry

I hear the evening rain
It sings a sad refrain
Beneath a clear and cloudless sky

How can I see the rain
On a night so clear
How can I still see your face
Though you're not here

Somethings I can't explain
You're gone but still remain
And the evening rain's not in the skies
It's in my eyes

Somethings I can't explain
You're gone but still remain
And the evening rain's not in the skies
It's in my eyes
