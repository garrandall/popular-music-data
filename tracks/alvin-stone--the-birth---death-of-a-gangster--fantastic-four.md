Alvin Stone
The birth of a gangster
Leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

Alvin wasn't out of knee pants good
Before he was running wild
As far as we could see back
He was always a problem child

They said Alvin was born and raised
He was raised from a bad, bad seed
One more? in this ghetto
Is the one thing that we don't need

Talking 'bout Alvin Stone
The birth of a gangster
Leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail
What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail

What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail
What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail

Anything I see I want
I'm gonna take it, yes, I will
(Alvin Stone)
Life's been hard on me
But, Lord, I know I'm gonna make it
(Alvin Stone)

I don't care what they say
Or what they call me, no, no
(Alvin Stone)
Don't blame me for what I am
Blame it on society (Alvin Stone)

Talking bout Alvin Stone
The birth of a gangster
Better leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

Graduated from the boy in the street
To the man behind the gun
Ordered people all around
With a dirty look for everyone

But tell me, why do women
Throw themselves at you, Alvin
I never will understand
They see that cool cold cluster of
Diamond rings shining on every hand

But tell me, what good
Is it gonna do you, Alvin
It's money you can't spend
You've become rich overnight
Dealing in heroin

Talking 'bout Alvin Stone
Oh, the birth of a gangster
You better leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail
What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail

What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail
What you doing with a gun in your hand
Don't you know you'll go to jail

Anything I see I want
I'm gonna take it (Alvin Stone)
Life's been hard on me
But, Lord, I know I'm gonna make it
(Alvin Stone)

I don't care what they say
Or what they call me, no, no
(Alvin Stone)
Don't blame me for what I am
Blame it on society (Alvin Stone)

Talking 'bout Alvin Stone
The birth of a gangster
Better leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

This is a holdup
Get outside that wall
Gimme that money

This is the FBI, where's Alvin Stone
Mister, I don't want no trouble
There he goes, out the back
Shoot to kill

Alvin with a bullet in your head
You're laying on the cold, cold ground
You look up and you see the people
Slowly gather around

How does it feel, won't you tell me
To never have had a friend, ha
Alvin, with a heart of stone
Said, if I could, I would do it again

Talking 'bout Alvin Stone, whoa, oh
The birth of a gangster
You know you better leave him alone
Lord, he's a sure 'nuff gangster

Oh, Alvin Stone, whoa, oh
The birth of a gangster
Yeah, you better leave him alone
Cause he's a sure 'nuff gangster

What you gonna tell your maker
Alvin Stone (Alvin Stone)
Tell em you're the law breaker
(Tell em you're the law breaker)
(Alvin Stone)

Da da da da
