My name is Paul Rothenberg, attorney of law
And I hereby ratify and confirm that Logic is motherfucking paid

Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex
I don't trust nobody, oh no (no, no, no!)
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (never know!)
If you weren't with me, in the beginning, you get no love
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, hoe

Hold bring it back, uh, I'ma call you back, uh
Too busy countin' stacks, uh, pickin' up the slack (slack!)
I was born in the trap (trap!), chains on, cooked crack
Logic never wanna flex, but Bobby finna bring the facts
Put my city on the map, fuck with the gang get attacked
It ain't a thing, RattPack, nobody know about that
Bitch, I been gunnin', comin' for the throne and I know that they talking, can't fuck with the tone
Talkin' shit 'bout Logic, I never respond
I'll let success talk, 'cause a word of advice:
More achievements for yourself and less talk
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond
If I ever did I dead you in this game with no respawn
Peace, Love, and Positivity that's all I want with you
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef, anyone that hate me, I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you surpressed
If feelings of self-hatred that you wan' project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck with me ain't ever shook my hand
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself
They don't understand, but no matter what happen you know thatâ

Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex
I don't trust nobody, oh no (no, no, no!)
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (never know!)
If you weren't with me in the beginning you get no love
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, hoe

Hi! It's uhâLogic, hi, sorry. It's Elton John calling you, um. I hope you don't mind me getting you on your mobileâor not getting on your mobile, but I was just, uhâcongratulating you first of all on your performance at the Grammys and then I was asking youâI was gonna ask you if you'd like to do something for me, and I will ring you back later and seeâand talk about it, thanks!
