I gave you everything I had 
You took my heart and broke it bad 
I'm not the kind who can take it alone 
I've got nothing more for you 
I want somebody who needs me too 
I've given up, boy 
I'm chasing my joy 
And you can make your own 
You're not the only one
'Cos my time will come 

You can shatter glass 
With your heart of stone 
But you won't get far on your own
You keep running hot and blowing cold 
And everything you hold 
Just falls apart like shattered glass

It really doesn't matter to me
Where you're going and who you see 
I know that I can make it this time 
It doesn't matter any more 
Since you've gone and walked out that door 
I made a new start 
I found a true heart
I'm gonna make it mine 
Go out and have your fun
'Cos my time will come 

You can shatter glass 
With your heart of stone 
But you won't get far on your own 
You keep running hot and blowing cold 
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like shattered glass 

You can shatter glass 
You can shatter glass 

You're not the only one 
Go out and have your fun 
'Cos my time will come 

You can shatter glass 
With your heart of stone 
But you won't get far on your own 
You keep running hot and blowing cold 
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like shattered glass
