Standing in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was one way ticket, only one way to go


So he started rocking
He is never going to stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's going to make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, he'll come alive tonight


In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change


Now he needs to keep on rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rocking'
Someday gonna make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He took one guitar, stars in his eyes
He'll come alive tonight woah

Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin'
Never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rocking'
Someday gonna make it to the top
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
Yeah juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, ah
Juke box hero, ah
Juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
Stars in his eyes
