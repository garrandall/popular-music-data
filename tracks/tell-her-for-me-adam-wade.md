Why be a big man
You know that you're blue
You know that it's true
Tell her, tell her, ah, ah, oh

Tell her for me, I'm tired of crying
(You love her, you know you still do)
Tell her for me, I'm through feeling blue
(Then why do you think of her
The whole night and day through)

Yes, you can say that I'll never cry again
Never beg for another chance
You can say that I'll never cry again
For an off and on romance

Oh, tell her for me, I'm glad it's over
(You don't mean a word that you say)
Thank her for dreams that never came true
(Now say what you really feel
Why suffer this way)

And if she should say
That it's so wrong to part
She'd like to start anew
Please tell her to call
I may just feel that way too

And if she should say
That it's so wrong to part
She'd like to start anew
Please tell her to call
I may just feel that way too

(Tell her you love her
Tell her you love her
You know that it's true
You know you still do)
