Juste the other day when I help you oh so tight
We didn't car if what we had was wrong or right
But now I am alone cause you left me for his smile
But getting over you girl

And you know I love you
OH I JUST CAN'T SAY GOODBYE GIRL
No,you know I need you baby
OH I JUST CAN'T SAY GOODBYE GIRL
To you
I felt things would be ok ay after a white
Ok baby

If you pass me the street
Just keep a walking right on by
Don't look back at me girl
Unless you want to see me cry
