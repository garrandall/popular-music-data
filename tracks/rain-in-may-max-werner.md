Feeling down when the Autumn has come
Stormy days and the leaves keep on falling
I don't like the town when the Autumn has come
Clouds are grey and there's fog outside

Feeling down when the Winter has come
Frozen feet and the snowflakes are falling
I don't like the town when the Winter has come
Dirty streets and it's cold outside
I don't care for a riding sleigh -
Get your share from the rain in May

Rain in May, wipes your worries away
Take a dose, take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

Feeling down when the Summer has come
Burning heat, drops of sweat keep on falling
I don't like the town when the Summer has come
Dusty streets and it's hot outside
I don't care for a sunny day -
Get your share from the rain in May

Rain in May, wipes your worries away
Take a dose take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

Rain in May wipes your worrying away
Take a dose take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

(Rain in May)
(Rain in May)
(Rain in May)
