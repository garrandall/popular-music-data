Only when you're lonely
Do you come knockin' at my door
Knowin' that I'll be there
To give you what you're lookin' for
Oh, when all your so called friends have left you fall

Only when you're lonely
Do you run to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you come to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you think of me at all

I'm not kidding myself
I know just where I fit in your plans
So don't you start kidding yourself
I'm not the fool you think I am
Oh, you toy with me
Just like I was your rubber ball

Only when you're lonely
Do you run to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you come to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you think of me at all

I don't mind (I don't mind)
'Cause the time I spend with you is precious to me
And though it's true (And though it's true)
I'm being used
Oh, it's alright 'cause I like havin' you around me

Only, when you're lonely
Do you come knockin' at my door
Knowin' somehow I'll be there
Like the too many times I've been before
Oh, loving you I know is my biggest fault

Only when you're lonely
Do you run to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you come to me
Only when you're lonely
Do you think of me at all
