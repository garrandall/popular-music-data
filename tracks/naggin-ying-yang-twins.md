women always talkin about what men do, 
we dont never talk about what women do...
at least till now
c'mon

every now and then you get mad
sometime I make you sad
make you want to say kiss my ass
Iâm tired of listening to you nag


She talking to me like Iâm dumb 
I should have known (should have known)
should have left that girl alone
Now Iâm stuck wit naggin'

This is for then fellaâs who be mess round with them women
and you get your heart caught up in the mix
cause your love touch  whatâs up her dress
and never payed attention
cause you didnât think the girl would start tripping
shawty flip the scripted
start saying all type of stuff out of her lips
and let me tell you what I cant stand
when a women play the role of a man
talking to a fellow like you got to hold his hand
treat me like a sped 
like he lack to understand
I know you know I ainât gone go for the short jacking  all the time
talking to me out of line broad 
truly you done lost your mind
you gone mess round and get me some time

every now and then you get mad
sometime I make you sad
make you want to say kiss my pants
got to listen to you nag


She talking to me like Iâm dumb 
I should have known (should have known)
should have left that girl alone
Now Iâm stuck in game

A lil more grip a lil less lip
before I pack my bag  on you girl and dip
and a point of no return and you made it that way
buy the stuff that you say in and out everyday
hope you paying attention cause i got to mention 
dissin me in front of your friends
trying to get a lil laugh in your crack in
I want to beat the **** in
hide behind your fake lil grin with your fake lil friend
use to then fake lil men
really ainât no man but you like how he pretend
Iâm going to keeping sipping my Hen and smoking my herbs
and  Iâm going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl
the way you talking absurd
getting on my nerves
all in my ear about to make me hit the curve  

every now and then you get mad
sometime I make you sad
make you want to say kiss my pants
got to listen to you nag


She talking to me like Iâm dumb 
I should have known (should have known)
should have left that girl alone
Now Iâm stuck in game

One day I got shot by cupid
this was when this relationship went stupid 
we was talking on the phone to long
never act her age she was always gone
telling me you out with your friends
find out later on you with your other men
you ain't nothing but a dividend
say you cut, cut but you ain't getting nothing
thatâs a shame and to hear its like this 
and I ainât got love for you trick
shoo fly donâ bother me
will i get back with her probably
then I thought about it I wont
do I really want you I don't
the headache i really don't want
so Iâm going to leave her a lone 
cause I can do bad on my on
that's why she gone

every now and then you get mad
sometime I make you sad
make you want to say kiss my pants
got to listen to you nag


She talking to me like Iâm dumb 
I should have known (should have known)
should have left that girl alone
Now Iâm stuck in game

Now, this isnât a song disrespectin women, 
This is a song that Ying Yang made 
For every man that eva walk on Godâs green Earth

Yo attitude stank sometime
So sit on that
Haaaaaaaaaaa

NAG!
