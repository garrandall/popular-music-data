Another life, another love
Another kill, another drug
Another touch, another taste
Oh, oh, oh
Another night, another war
Another "what are we fighting for?"
Another lost to bitter pain
Oh, oh, oh

Is everybody out here crazy?
Anybody want a war, war?
Everybody out here crazy
Crazy, hail to the victor
Hail to the victor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Another dusk, another dawn
Another game, another God
Another day to buy your fate
Oh, oh, oh
Took a left to right a wrong
Another battle in Babylon
Out of luck but full of faith
Oh, oh, oh

Is everybody out here crazy?
Anybody want a war, war?
Everybody out here crazy
Crazy, hail to the victor
Hail to the victor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I swear on heaven and hell
This is my revenge
Thank God, I'm high up above
This is not the end
My friend, it's not the end
My friend, it's not the end
My friend, it's not the end
My friend, it's not the end

Hail to the victor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hail to the victor
