Lookin' in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I found is too good to be true
Standin' here beside you
Want so much to give you this love in my heart
That I'm feelin' for you


Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand
Baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart


And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Oh, whoa


I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do


Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart


And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us


Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever and ever and ever, hey


And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us, woah


And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
If this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Oh, no)


And we can build this dream together (Hey baby)
Standing strong forever (I know)
Nothing's gonna stop us now (Hey baby, nothing's gonna stop us)
If this world runs out of lovers (Hey baby, ooh)
We'll still have each other (Nothing's gonna)
Nothing's gonna stop us (Hey baby, nothing's gonna stop us now, yeah)
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
