I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tire of foolin' around with two or three

Just come on home and fool around with me
Then come on home and fool around with me

Well I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you a fool I'll always be

So honey fool around. You know right where I'm at
And don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
And when you're tire of foolin' around with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tire of foolin' round with two or three
Just come on home and fool around with me
