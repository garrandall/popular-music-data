No tell yo' mama

No telephone

No tellin' baby when I take you tonight

Nobody baby

Know where you gone

No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight

Maybe inside of heaven

But if I do

No tellin' baby when I take you

Make you

Take you

Tonight

No tellin' baby

Can't tell what's right

No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight

Maybe inside of heaven

Under the lights

Just like a movie when I take you tonight

Can't you just see us runnin'

Right out of sight

Nobody tellin' when I take you

Make you

Take you

No tell yo' mama

No telephone

No tellin' baby when I take you tonight

Nobody baby

Know where you gone

No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight

Maybe inside of heaven

But if I do

No tellin' baby when I take you

Make you

Take you
