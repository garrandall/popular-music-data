No one ever kissed me the way you do
Ah... no one ever told me I love you, no one ever cared
Ah... no one ever said all those dreams
That I dreamed would come true
Ah... no one ever hurt me the way you do
Ah... no one ever broke my heart in two
I'll keep on caring my whole life through
For no one, no one, but you

No one ever hurt me the way you do
No one ever broke my heart in two
I'll keep on caring my whole life through
For no one, no one, but you
