Welllll!
You can have your gold and your diamonds too
All I want is a ring dang doo
Well! I've been all over this big old world, hey
Looking for a ring dang do
I've fallen in love with a thousand girls, yeah
Looking for a ring dang do
I've got a mojo bag and a little voodoo
But I ain't never found a ring dang doo

Well! I was a' down in New Orleans
Looking for a ring dang do
I fell in love with a girl in tight blue jeans
Looking for a ring dang do
Said I can't stay though my love is true
I've got to keep a lookin' for a ring dang do
Yeaaahhh! Ring Dang Do
Where are you?
What are you?

From Mexico to the Phillipines, yeah
Looking for a ring dang do
Well! I've drunk with peasants and I've dined with kings
Looking for a ring dang do
But I ain't never found a single clue
I've got to keep a lookin' for that ring dang do

Well! People call me crazy every single day
Yeah! Looking for a ring dang do
But I don't care what the people may say
No! Looking for a ring dang do
I don't know what it looks like or what it can do
I keep looking for that ring dang do

Ring dang ring dang ring dang do
Ring dang ring dang ring dang do
You can have your gold and your diamonds too
All I want is a ring dang doo
Ring dang ring dang ring dang do
Ring dang ring dang ring dang do
Where are you?
