You could have been a bad girl
And wasted all my time
You could have got me mad girl
And made me lose my mind
But you did what you have to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you

It makes me very proud baby
To know that you're my girl
I want to say it loud baby
I want to tell the world
That you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
I've got everything a man could need
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed
I won't cry myself to sleep no more
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for

Now I don't have a problem
'Cause I know who I am
You see I lost my only problem
When you made me your man
'Cause you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
