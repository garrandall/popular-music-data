Wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I got an old coat for a pillow and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
But take me now and know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son
Call me young gun

You're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin' I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister, catch me if you can

Shot down in a blaze of glory
But take me now, know the truth
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun

Each night I go to bed
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
God, I gotta ask a favour and I hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Starin' down the bullet, let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
