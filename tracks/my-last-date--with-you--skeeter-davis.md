One hour and I'll be meeting you
I know you're gonna make me blue
My heart is trembling
Through and through
Cause I know very well
I can tell
I can tell
This will be my last date with you

Just can't believe that this could end
I know I'll never love again
You'll ask me to be just a friend
This is plain as can be
I can see
I can see
This will be my last date with you

I know we had a quarrel
But all sweethearts do
I gave my love to prove to you
That I will always love you and be true

I know you've met someone new
You'll tell me you and I are through
My plans and dreams cannot come true
And when you say goodbye
I know I will cry cause
I'll know it's my last date with you
