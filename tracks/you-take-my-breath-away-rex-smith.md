You, I don't know what to say
You take my breath away
You're every song I sing
You're the music that I play
And you take my breath away

You, you smile and it's okay
You take my breath away
Like water from a spring on a sizzling summer day
Oh you take my breath away

There are words for the magic of a sunrise
Only none of them will do
For you, you take my breath away
And I don't know what to say
'Cause you take my breath away

You, you take my breath away
And I don't know what to say
'Cause you take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

You take my breath away
You take my breath away
Oh yeah, you take my breath away
Oh, you take my breath away
Oh, I say you take my breath away, yeah yeah
I say, I say, I say you take my breath away
