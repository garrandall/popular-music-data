I know you know
Exactly what I'm thinking
Now it's in your eyes
You blame me for a fool
You did me wrong
And lost my love forever
And now you know
Life could be so cruel

Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Why do you keep cryin'? No
Won't you tell me? Yeah

Lets not pretend
The things are getting better
Don't understand
It's game of love we play
I can go on
Feeling broken hearted
It's much to late
Now that we have parted

I know you know
Exactly what I'm thinking
Now it's in your eyes
You blame me for a fool
You did me wrong
And lost my love forever
And now you know
Life could be so cruel

Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Why do you keep cryin'? No
Won't you tell me? Yeah
Why do you keep cryin'? No
Won't you tell me? Yeah

Ke-ke-keep cryin'
Ke-ke-keep cryin'
Ke-ke-keep cryin'

I'll try so hard
To keep our love together
Just tell me why
Your love was so untrue
This lonley nights
It seems will last forever
And now you know
That life could be so cruel

Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Why do you keep cryin'? No
Won't you tell me? Yeah (no, no more lying)
Why do you keep cryin'? No
No, no more lying

Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Why do you keep cryin'? No
No, no more lying

Don't you come cryin' baby
Don't you come cryin'
Don't you come cryin' baby
No, no more lying
Don't you come cryin' baby
