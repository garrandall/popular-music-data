Come on, baby, dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never like to see you cry
Won't you please forgive me
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness


I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes


So many nights I longed to hold you
So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place


I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
(I am just a man) Human
(Human) Please forgive me


The tears I cry aren't tears of pain
They're all to hide my guilt and shame
I forgive you, now I ask the same of you
While we were apart, I was human too


(Human
Human)
I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made (I am just a man)
Human
Born to make mistakes


(Human
Human)
