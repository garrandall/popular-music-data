Well, if words wont do it
And words are just a waste of time
We could get right to it
If I could only read your mind

You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that could melt your heart
Baby, tell me just where to start

What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you keeps me lying away
Tell me what would it take

If the night don't move it
Then you've never seen the stars come out
If the touch don't soothe him
Then maybe you've just never been touched

But I wanna be the one to change your mind
I think about it all the time
Still waters they run deep
I wanna wake you from your deepest sleep

What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you keeps me lying away
Tell me what would it take

You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that will melt your heart
Baby, tell me just where to start

What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you keeps me lying away
Tell me what would it take

Hey, tell me what would it take
Tell me what would it take, tell me, tell me
Tell me what would it take
Yeah, tell me what would it take, tell me, tell me, oh yeah
Tell me what would it take, tell me what would it take
