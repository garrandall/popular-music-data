When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind, if you won't see me
You won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I can turn away if you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'

Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long since you've been gone
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'

Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long since you've been gone
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me
You won't see me...
