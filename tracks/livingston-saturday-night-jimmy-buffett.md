You got your Tony Lama's on your jeans pressed tight,
You take a few tokes, make you feel all right,
Rockin' and rollin' on a Livingston Saturday Night.

Pickup's washed and you just got paid.
With any luck at all you might even get laid,
'Cause they're pickin' and a-kickin'
on a Livingston Saturday Night.

So won't you listen to the sound of a hot country band,
Boot heels shufflin' on the dance floor Sam
Sing a song, play some pong, shoot a little pool,
Hittin' on the honeys right out of high school.
Yeah, fifteen may get you twenty,
but that's all right,
"Cause they're rockin and a rollin' on a
Livingston Saturday Night

So won't you listen to the sound of the hot country band,
Boot heels shufflin' on the dance floor Sam,
Hum a song, play some pong, eat a deviled egg,
Temperature is rising, better pop another keg.

Fifteen may get you twenty, but that's all right,
'Cause they'll be rockin' and a rollin' on a
Livingston Saturday Night.
