Well, hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?
I said, hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?
Aw, well, come on over baby, step into my time machine

You better jump into my action, I'm gonna' make you feel right
Aw, jump into my action, I'm gonna' make you feel right
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm gonna love you tonight

Step into the front row, I'm gonna' show you how
Step into the front row, I wanna' show you how
Don't worry 'bout no time we can always come back to right now
Aw, I'm gonna give it to you

When you wanna come back, we just turn about
When you wanna come back, we just turn about
But we ain't gonna come back, till there ain't no doubt

Now don't it get good to you? Do you know what I mean?
Said, don't it get good to you? Don't you know what I mean?
Well, come on over baby, jump into my time machine
