The time had come to elect a president
And all the famous candidates thought they were heaven sent
They screamed and raved and pounded their hands upon their hearts
But, soon their noble promises were hard to tell apart
Waiting at the pumpkin patch, a dog, sincere and brave
And everybody hoped that soon the country he would save
The pumpkin said, "The day has come for you to take a stand
For love has left the people across our native land"
Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule
But, we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine right through

All the politicians, they swore he couldn't win
But Snoopy only shook his head and flashed his famous grin
He jumped into his faithful friend, the Sopwith Camel plane
And bounced around the countryside from Washington to Maine
Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule
But, we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine right through

New York State was looking bad, 'til Snoopy made a speech
Soon Illinois and Tennessee were both within his reach
He won the vote in Oregon, but time was growing thin
And back at the convention hall, the votes were pouring in

Snoopy smiled his way into the hearts of everyone
But when the votes were counted up, they found he needed one
The winning vote for Snoopy came when a stranger raised his hand
Snoopy turned, the stranger spoke, "Mein friend, we meet again!"
Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule
But, we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine right through

Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule
But, we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine right through
