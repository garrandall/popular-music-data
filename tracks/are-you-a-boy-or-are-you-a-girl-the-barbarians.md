They called us the Invaders
As though we came from another world
And a man from immigration
Shouted out, "Hey Punk, you a boy or a girl?"

"Hey tutti fruitti give us a kiss"
The custom man proclaimed
'Cause the world as he knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day the Invaders came

They called us the Invaders
Like Creatures from the Black Lagoon
Said that we were dangerous
Like space invaders from the moon

We just came to see the world
And entertain America
We just came to get a break
Not to turn into enemies of the State

'Cause the world as he knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day the Invaders came

They called us illegal aliens
As though we were poncing off the state
And as we walked through immigration
They heard me speak and shouted out, "You wait

Hey buddy, get back in the line"
His eyes were full of hate
'Cause the world as he knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day the Invaders came

They called us the Invaders
Like barbarians full of hate
Said that we were dangerous
Like warriors sent to pillage and rape

We all dance to a different tune
They didn't like my attitude
Culture clash like chalk and cheese
Misunderstood in the land of the free

'Cause the world as he knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day the Invaders came
Yes, the world as he knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day the Invaders came
