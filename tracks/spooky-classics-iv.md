In the cool of the evenin'
When everything is gettin' kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you if you'd like to
Go with me and see a movie

First you say no
You've got some plans for the night
And then you stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessin'
I never seem to know what you are thinkin'
And if a fella looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'

I get confused
'Cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky, heh, yeah

If you decide someday to stop
This little game that you are playin'
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dyin' to be sayin'

Just like a ghost
You've been a-hauntin' my dreams
So I'll propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

Spooky, spooky
Oh, whoa, all right, I said spooky
Oh, yeah, yeah, I said spooky
Yeah, yeah
Oh spooky, spooky
I said spooky
