Consider this an invitation to my gangsta nation


Na na na na na na na na (Westside)
Na na na na na na na na (oh oh)
Na na na na na na na na (what what)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na na (we dream gangster shit)
Na na na na na na na na (so dream gangster shit)
Na na na na na na na na

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck


Nigga I'm tired of these niggas barking that shit talkin' that shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' that shit
And videos in a bitch pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gon' bust and know that
It's a Dub-S-C thang WC brain
And we don't fuck with niggas in khaki G-strings
Fuck moving I'm clearing the crowd
It's the hoo-banging bandanna cri-mi-ni-mi-nal
The ori-gi-nal


Evacuate the building bitch here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you playing nigga this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear bitch insane
And we number-one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us homie, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-board in a H2 Hummer
Looking hotter than a motherfucking L.A. summer
Let's go

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck


What the fuck is Ice Cube talking about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy I ain't gon' get
I don't holler at these hoes that sing like Ashante
Body like BeyoncÃ©, face like Andre (uh)
Bitch you kinda strangÃ©
But I'm rich so my entrÃ©
Got to be bomb grade


Have you seen us, naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas making blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas hypnotic by the liters
With a flock of hoes on us
'Cause the chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'm 'a stay bagging for the whole G Nation nigga

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck


It's a gangsta nation if you're in you're a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't ball like me
'Cause I'm really from the gang you all is industry
And while I'm serving up and coming young hustlers and gluckas
Banging for the hood causing havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label kissing ass like suckers
And you're bitches. So, sit down when you piss motherfuckin'


One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the gangsta nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a stick pussy, nigga, you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
'Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singing on it


Look here, mate
Check this shit out, mate, look
You might as well say "Fuck it" and join this Westside thang, mate
'Cause we got a motherfucking gangsta nation going over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motherfucking be
Believe that, homie. Look
It ain't a hit 'til Nate Dogg spit

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Consider this an invitation to my gangsta nation)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Bitch you know the side
We're world-motherfucking-wide
