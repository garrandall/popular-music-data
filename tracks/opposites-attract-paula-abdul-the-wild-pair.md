I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my homegirl Paula Abdul

Baby seems we never
Ever agree
You like the movies
And I like T.V

I take things serious
And you take 'em light
I go to bed early
And I party all night

Our friends are sayin'
We ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly
And baby I'm fast

I like it quiet
And I love to shout
But when we get together
It just all works out

I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

Who would've thought
We could be lovers
She makes the bed
And he steals the covers

She likes it neat
And he makes a mess
I take it easy
Baby I get obsessed

She's got the money
And he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes
I like to smoke

Things in common?
There just ain't a one
But when we get together
We have nothin' but fun

I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

You know it, baby

Nothing in common but this trust
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus
One going up, one coming down
But we seem to land on common ground

When things go wrong we make corrections
To keep things moving in the right direction
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack
It's useless: opposites attract

Baby, ain't it something how we lasted this long?
You and me proving everyone wrong
I don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
It don't really matter 'cause we perfectly matched

I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

2 steps forward
2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

2 steps forward
2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
It ain't fiction
You know it's a fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract

2 steps forward
2 steps back
2 steps back
'Cause opposites attract
We come together
We go together
Opposites
I said, opposites attract
