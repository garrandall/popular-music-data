You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby
'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well, there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me, you got nothing left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you, but you wanna wear my ring

Well, there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say, "That line is great."
You ask me what it meant by
"Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky"
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah
The Dolphins make me cry

Well, there's nothing I can do
Only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
