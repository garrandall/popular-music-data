All my love
Give me the right to give you
All my love
With all my might
I'd give you all my love
If I had only half a chance

Into your world
Oh, let me come and being you
All my love
No other one could give you half the love
That I feel in my heart for you

Come to me
Come and let me share your destiny
Can you see
There's just you within the heart of me

So wonderful
I know our love could be so wonderful
For it is written in the stars above
That you were made for all my love
