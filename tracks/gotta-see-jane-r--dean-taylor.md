Red light, green light,
Speedin' trough the dark night,
Drivin' trough the poundin' rain
I gotta see jane
Windshield wiper splashin',
Splashin', callin' out her name
Just gotta see jane
I left her arms to find my way
To find a place for me in the world outside
I wasn't alive, I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, turned my heart cold inside
I gotta find what I left behind
Red light, green light,
Speedin' through the dark night,
Drivin' through the poundin' rain,
I gotta see jane
Freeway, byway,
Tearin' up the highway,
Runnin' up a world insane
Just gotta see jane
A town of steel that isn't real
It could not feel what's in the heart of me
I was so alone in a world of stone
I missed her arms, that once held me
That made me see, I was the lonely one
But now and then I was runnin' scared
And I could feel the touch of time
Turnin' the wheel of life to yesterday
When love and happiness were mine
I gotta find that world of jane and me
Liked it used to be
Oh, I gotta see jane
Her love for me I pushed aside
Walked out alone
To face a world turned cold
Although I tried I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, it's not a part of me
I've gotta find what I left behind
Oh, I gotta see jane, I gotta see jane
