Virgil Spencer's got a 19 inch Hitachi
And many demons lingering
Friday night, he pulled a gun to change the channel
Something that he picked up from the King
His wife remembers well the man she knew
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue
She's wasted years
No time for tears

'Cause there's another chance
A someday soon
Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of Birmingham

It's 3 am and Virgil's passed out on the sofa
A fifth of Jim Beam on the floor
She's packed her bags, she slips the keys out of his pocket
She's careful not to slam the door
And as she drives she rubs her rosary
She's never been so all alone, she's never felt so free
She got miles to go
Blind faith and hope

'Cause there's another chance
And a someday soon
Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of Birmingham

As the rain falls down upon the interstate
Any doubts she had are all but washed away
A long look back
At Birmingham

'Cause there's another chance
And a someday soon
Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of Birmingham

Another chance
And a someday soon
Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of, yeah, yeah, Birmingham
Birmingham

Yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa baby
Yeah, someday soon
Baby, someday soon
Yeah, someday soon
Hey, hey, yeah
Keep on driving
Yeah, keep on driving baby, yeah
