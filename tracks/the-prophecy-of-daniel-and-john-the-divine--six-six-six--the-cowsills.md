And when they saw her rising, from the ocean
A name was on her forehead Babylon, Babylon

Six is the number, six is the number of a man
Six is the number, six is the number of a man

She was arrayed in purple and scarlet color
And golden pearls, and in her hand
She held a golden cup

It's been written down to reveal
Six is the mark of his seal
It's been written to understand
Six is the number of a man

Six, six, six
Six, six, six

There's a revelation

Then finally one day she was cast back into the sea from where she came
So that she would never torment man again

It's been written down in revelation
Daniel and John explanation
When you read it you will find
It's a sign of warning for mankind

Six, six, six
Six, six, six
