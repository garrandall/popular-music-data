Above the colour of amber stained evening
An audience danced
Led by a showering hand that brings water
To both sea and land
Unlock the door of night
Nebulous bright

Again renewed by the vessels of Isis
You're ready to fly
Although the journey is still far from ended
You gaze at the sky
Above the cloudless night
Nebulous bright

He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star

He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star

Again renewed by the vessels of Isis
You're ready to fly

He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star

He who knows love knows who you are

He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star

He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star
