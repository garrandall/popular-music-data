Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa

Chorus:
Show me the color of love
Some how it seems like a sign from above
Get closer
Love is all we need
The color of love

I have been watching you all night
And I know you can feel it too
I'm trembling inside
I Love You
Whoa, Whoa
Back in time we met
Those days we had I will never forget
Whoa, Whoa
I can't do without you
A love so true
Whoa, Whoa

Chorus

To know that love you've given me
I'll be there if you feel the same
Your the one I see
Theres no shame
Whoa, Whoa
Back in time we met
Those days we had I will never forget
Whoa, Whoa
I can't do without you
A love so true
Whoa, Whoa

Chorus

Whoa, Whoa
Back in time we met
Those days we had I will never forget
Whoa, Whoa
I can't do without you
A love so true
Whoa, Whoa

Chorus
