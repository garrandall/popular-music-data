Way down south in Okefenokee (Whoa)
As the sun goes down and the air gets cool (Whoa)
There's a real neat beat travelin' over the water (Whoa)
It's makin' me a dancin' fool

Okefenokee, Okefenokee
Choo-wah
Choo-wah
Choo-wah

Out on a lake down in Okefenokee (Whoa)
There's a riverboat where the cats all show (Whoa)
Stompin' their feet and clappin' in rhythm (Whoa)
It's wilder than a rodeo

Okefenokee, Okefenokee
Choo-wah
Choo-wah
Choo-wah

On the deck of the boat down in Okefenokee (Whoa)
Met a Georgia peach who was rarin' to go (Whoa)
We danced up a storm with the tom-toms boomin' (Whoa)
'Til someone hollered "Fire, below!"

Well, the boat went down in Okefenokee (Whoa)
While the cats and chicks scrambled for the door (Whoa)
My baby and I stole a kiss on the water (Whoa)
I kissed her all the way to shore

Okefenokee, Okefenokee
Choo-wah
Choo-wah
Choo-wah

Come on, Georgia (Whoa)
Let's party, sugar
Yeah, bye-bye, Okefenokee
So long for now, baby

Come on, Georgia
Let's party, baby

Come on swing it, baby
Come on, honey
Aw, sugar
Please, baby
