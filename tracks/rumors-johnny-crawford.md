Do, dooby, dooby
Sha, la, la, la

Everyone in town
Just wants to put me down
With their rumors
(Rumors)

They've been telling you
That your baby's been untrue
But it's rumors
(Rumors)

Aw, people love to talk
Let them have their say
They can take a walk
We'll make out okay

Darling, this you must believe
I would never, never
Ever leave you

People jealous of a boy
And girl in love started rumors
(Rumors)
Don't believe a word of
Those silly things you heard
They're just rumors
(Rumors)

Aw, let the rumors fly
You'll find by and by
Deep within my heart
You're the only one that I adore
So don't believe the rumors anymore

Aw, let the rumors fly
You'll find by and by
Deep within my heart
You're the only one that I adore
So don't believe the rumors anymore

Do, dooby, dooby
Sha, la, la, la
