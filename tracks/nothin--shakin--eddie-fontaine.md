Well, ever since the day that you left me
I been whinin' like a little lost pup
The sun went down when you left town
And you ain't a gonna come back up
A walkin' in a wearin' out leather
A scuffin' up the hardwood floor
Starin' at the phone since you've been gone
And listenin' for the knock on the door
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
And they wouldn't shake if it wasn't for the breeze
There ain't nothin' happenin' with the birds and the bees
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves

Hurt keeps a lookin' through my window
The heartaches are laughin' in the hall
And I've got the news that old man blues
Is a seepin' through the cracks in the wall
The end is a waitin' round the corner
And hope is just about gone
If you only knew how I needed you
Well, then you'd come a running back home
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
And they wouldn't shake if it wasn't for the breeze
There ain't nothin' happenin' with the birds and the bees
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves

Well, there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
And they wouldn't shake if it wasn't for the breeze
There ain't nothin' happenin' with the birds and the bees
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves
No, there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves...
