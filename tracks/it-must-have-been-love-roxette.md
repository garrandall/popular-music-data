(It must have been love but it's over now)

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

(Must have been love but it's over now)
(Must have been love but it's over now)
