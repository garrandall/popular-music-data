There's this boy I know he's afraid of the ocean
Never quite found love but he drank the love potion
I'll be on the chain smoking in the basement
Shattered like the windows

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide til the end
And I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

Parked my bag of bones back of the station
He said make yourself at home so I started day drinking
Said I believe in time after seven eight or nine
You'll fall yourself to pieces

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide til the end
And I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide til the end
And I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
