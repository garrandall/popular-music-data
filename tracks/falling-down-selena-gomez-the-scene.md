You walk and talk like you're some new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend your money, you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right, so you can get the right reaction


It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for


You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down
Falling down, you're falling down, you're falling down


What's out of place when you look into the mirror?
The truth is blurry, but the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed
Your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses, but they're all just made of plastic


It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for


You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down


Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
Smile for the camera (Camera, camera)
Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch ya?


You (You, oh)


You (You)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (You)
When you're falling down, no, it's not all about
You (You)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down


Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
