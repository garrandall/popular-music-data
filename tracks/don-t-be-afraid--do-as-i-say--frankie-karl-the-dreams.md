Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby

Girl, please come closer (do it, do it)
Look me in the eye (do it, do it)
Tell me that you love me more (do it, do it)
With each day that goes by

Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby

Put your arms around me (do it, do it)
Squeeze with all your might (do it, do it)
Pucker your lips and kiss me girl (do it, do it)
Taste love's pure delight

Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby

(Yeah!)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Don't be afraid, do as Isay, baby
(Hold me, hold me, hold me)
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
(Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me)
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
(Kiss me, ahh!)
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
(Love me, love me, love me)
