Yes! It's so crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B,
It's your boy, young.


You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no


Yeah, history in the making,
Part 2, it's so crazy right now


I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two three times in a row,

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Your touch got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,

It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch (you're in love) got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

I'm looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy your love.


I'm on that now, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R-O-C
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only,
Stick bony,
But the pocket is fat like Tony,
Soprano the ROC handle like Van Exel,
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to,
The genuine article I do not sing though,
I sling though, if anything I bling yo,

Star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy bring your whole set,
Jay-Z in the range,
Crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla.
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I've been iller than chain smokers,
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over,
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since I made the change over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one!


Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cause baby you got me, you got me so crazy baby

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's (oh love) got me looking so crazy right now (lookin' crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss (baby) got me hoping you'll save me right now (baby)
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.
