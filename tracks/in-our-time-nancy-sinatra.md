People used to bill and coo
But that don't make it with you
Coz there's other things we do
In our time, baby
In our time, yeah
In our time, baby
In our time

Girls were once suffragettes
Now they're out takin' bets
Smokin' filter cigarettes
In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
In our time

Holdin' hands in the Louvre
Used to be such a groove
Now some take trips and never move
In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
In our time

Mickey Mouse ain't no kid
Since he read the Wizard of Id
He's trying to figure out what he did
In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
In our time

Housewives dig rock 'n' roll
If you're wrong you've got soul
If you're twenty then you're old
In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
Our own sweet time

In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
In our time 
In our time, baby
In our time, yeah
In our time....
