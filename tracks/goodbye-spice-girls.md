No no no no, no no no no, no no no no

Listen little child there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say, never mind the pain
Or the aggravation, you know there's a better way
For you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me

Goodbye my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)

So glad we made it
Time will never change it
No no no
No no no no

Just a little girl
Big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (into the world)
What a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)

So glad we made it
Time will never change it
No no no
No no no no

You know it's time to say goodbye
No no no no

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)

So glad we made it
Time will never never ever change it
No no no no

You know it's time to say goodbye
No no no no
And don't forget you can rely
No no no no
You know it's time to say goodbye
And don't forget on me you can rely
No no no no
I will help you help you on your way
No no no no
I will be with you everyday
No no no no
I will be with you everyday
