He don't love you like I love you
If he did he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's trying to tear us apart

Fare thee well, I know you're leaving
For the new love you've found
That handsome guy that you've been dating
Whoa, I've got a feeling he's going to put you down

He don't love you like I love you
If he did he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's trying to tear us apart

Now he uses all the great quotations
He says all the things I'd love to say
But he's had so many rehearsals
To him it's just another play

But wait, and when the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
I'll be there to take you home

He don't love you
