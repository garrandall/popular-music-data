I'm not the one, that you'll be shootin' for
I'm not the one, who's coming back for more
(You know why)
We've been through this too many times
(You know why)
It's never clear, it's pantomime

Goin' round and round 'cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round, never lettin' down

I'm not the one, whose memory you still keepin'
I'm not the one who's talkin' in your sleep
(You know why)
I don't have to tell you twice
(You know why)
Knew you when you weren't so nice

Goin' round and round 'cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round, never touchin' down

I'm not the one that you'll be breakin' in
And I'm not the one that you'll be takin' in
(You know why)
Tried and tried to crack the shell
(You know why)
When you fake, it's hard to tell

Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round and round and round

Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
