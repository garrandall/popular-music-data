She looks so pretty with no makeup on (With no makeup on)
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone (To her mama on the phone)
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song (Eminem song)
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl, yeah


Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, oh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl



Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl, yeah


Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, oh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl


Yeah, that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up
My girl
In my heart, in my soul and the air that I breathe every day
That's my girl
Yeah, everything
My girl


That's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, oh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl
Yeah, that's my girl
