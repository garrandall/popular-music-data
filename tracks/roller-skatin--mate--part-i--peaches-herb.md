Oh, hey, hey, ha
Oh, oh

Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you

Pardon me, but I gotta let you know
You're a fabulous skater
You're a one person show

You've got moves
Others dream they can do
I'd give anything on earth
If I could skate with you

Take my hand and we'll glide around the rink
To be grooving right beside you
Is all I wanna think

Fast and fine, hey, I can't look away
Got my eyes glued on you
And the way you swing and sway

I dig you every night, rocking to the music
You're like a sexy vision
Skating in the moonlight

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Got my fingers crossed, I'm hoping I'll be

Skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you

You're so free
You jump high up in the air
Won't you roll with me
And make us a perfect pair?

Leaning real low
On a criss-crossing stroll
Say I wanna do it all
See, I'm really hot to roll

I dig you every night
Rocking to the music
You're like a sexy vision
Skating in the moonlight

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on

Touch my waist, promise we'll fly
Sparkling like the fourth of July
Oh, you say you will and I do guarantee
You could open my heart, be my skating key

And we'll keep on skating
We may never slow down
Lace em up tight and
Skate all over town

We're lovers on wheels and we do what we do
Side by side on a sidewalk for two
I dig you every night, rocking to the music
You're like a sexy vision, skating in the moonlight

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on

Oh, got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you

Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you

Roll on, yeah
Roll on, yeah
Roll on, roll on
Roll on, roll on

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down, let's keep on skating, hey

Roll, roll on, roll, roll on
Let's keep on, a grooving, oww

Roll on, let's roll
With the soul now

Skating, dating
Moving, grooving
Rolling, souling

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be
Your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down
Let's keep on a spinning now

Roll on to the place
Cross the floor, y'all

Whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be
Your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down, yeah

Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date

Gee, I'd love to be
Your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down
