When you come across
The guy who thinks he's boss
Yet never knows the reason why
He won't let you pass
Won't answer things you ask
He's got his orders do or die

Someone said to me
If you tip the doorman heavily
His doors will open wide for you
Goes to show what money can do
Win again lose again
Don't feel sad when things go bad
You just do the best you can
Do the best you can

Please be kind to those
Who fail to comprehend
And in time who knows
You'll maybe make a friend

If you leave your car
And you're not going far
Remember what time to be back
If it slips your mind
I'm sure in time you'll find
A Rita waiting in a mac

Please be kind to those
Who fail to comprehend
And in time who knows
You'll maybe make a friend

Win again lose again
Don't feel sad when things go bad
You just do the best you can
Do the best you can
Do the best you can
