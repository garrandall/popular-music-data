You've seen the new look
And you've heard the new sound
Now the Continental Walk
Is in your town
Let's do the continental walk
Get up, everybody
And let's walk, walk, walk
Let's do the continental walk
Come on, everybody now
And let's walk, walk, walk
Round and round
The Union Hall floor
Come on, let's walk now
(Walk, walk, walk) let's walk
Hey, you're looking good, baby
I want you to know
You're continental
From head to toe
You've got it made
Keep strolling with your babe
Until the music fades
(Walk, walk, walk)
Let's walk now
Come on, come on
Let's do the continental walk
Get up, everybody
And let's walk, walk, walk
Let's do the continental walk
Come on, everybody now
And let's walk, walk, walk
Round and round
The Union Hall floor
Come on, let's walk now
(Walk, walk, walk) let's walk
The Continental Dance
Is the dance of today
So you better get with it
Cause it's here, here to stay
Hey, little mama
With the pretty smile
Let's you and me
Continental awhile
The way you move on your feet
Gee, you look so sweet
Well, it's alright now
Well, it's alright
Let's go now
Let's do the continental walk
Get up, get up, get up everybody
And let's walk, walk, walk
Let's do the continental walk
Come on, everybody now
And let's walk, walk, walk
Round and round
The Union Hall floor
Come on, let's walk now
(Walk, walk, walk) let's walk
Ah, don't let me walk alone
Baby, baby, lead me on
Let's go to the Union Hall
Where everybody's having a ball
Come on, let's walk...
