I like things
That go fast 
'Cause I know that good things
Don't ever last 

I like believing
In what I want to 
Don't like no one
To tell me what to do 

And I like 
The times that we've had 
But I couldn't tell you
What's good or bad 

I'm only hoping
That you understand 
This feeling that I'm feeling 
When I'm holding your hand

(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)

I like the sound
Of breaking glass 
And if you don't believe me
Why did you ask? 

I like leaving town
And coming back home 
I'm going to show ya
When we're all alone 

And I like
Staying up all night 
Watching old movies
Until the morning light 

I don't pretend to know
What's right or wrong 
But I won't like leaving
If I stay here too long

(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)
Well, what about you?

I like things
That don't change 
'Cause the more something changes
The more it stays the same 

I might be simple
Take it easy sometimes 
But I can be stubborn
When I've made up my mind

I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)
I know what I like to do

(I know what I like)
I know
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like to do)

(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)
