I don't know what it is
That makes the flowers grow
And I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so

But without sunshine and rain
The flower soon will die
And without your love
So would I, so would I

I never even tried to understand
Why it thrills me so
When you only touch my hand

And I don't know what it is
That lights the stars above
And I don't know what it is
That makes me need your love

But I know the stars will shine
In the night as years go by
And I know I'll love you
Til I die, til I die

Oh, oh, oh...

But I know the stars will shine
In the night as years go by
And I know I'll love you
Til I die, til I die

Oh, oh, oh...
