Never thought you bring me so much pain
Lord knows I tried to keep you happy girl
in ever way
out on the road doing my thang trying to
keep you laced
trying to keep a smile upon your face girl
was all my happiness in vain
or did I place in you a little too much faith
now nothing but memories
never though that this would be the price I
had to pay


You took my heart you took my car you took
my crib
got the nerves to take my kids
got the nerves to take my kids
you took my love and my life
girl you took my soul
taking everything from me
taking everything from me
you took my heart girl you took my car
and you took my crib trying to take my kids
girl you took my love than you took my soul
taking everything everything everything
everything everything

And now I'm sitting all alone
trying to figure out where you and I went
wrong
you know it makes me wanna cry
just thinking about it makes me wanna lay
down and die
for the life of me I don't know how
that you could take for granted and disregard
our sacred vows
now nothing but memories
never though that this would be the price I
had to pay


You took my heat girl you took my cars
trying to take my crib
got the nerve to take my kids
got the nerve to take my kids
and take my love an my life
girl you took my soul
you've taking everything from me
taking everything from me
you took my heart my pride
my crib my kids my love my soul
everything everything everything
everything everything everything

Now I ain't never been no fool
I've always tried to keep my cool
I was faithful to you never abuse you or
use you
even though sometimes you make me want to
but I love you
you should try to understand girl that I
was your man
my life was in your hands baby was shinning
over everything
now you're gone and I'm just gonna be a
weekend Daddy baby
can I call you baby or is that just a passing
thing
