Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes
And it's startin' to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me

Just keep it friendly girl
'Cause I don't wanna leave
Don't start clingin' to me girl
'Cause I can't breathe

Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me

Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman, child
And it's warm where you're touchin' me
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile
You're seein' way too much in me

Girl, don't let your life
Get tangled up with mine
'Cause I'll just leave you 
I can't take no clingin' vine

Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me

Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby, don't get hooked on me

Baby baby don't get hooked on me
