(CHORUS)
Delta Queen, honey, honey
Where you been
Delta Queen, honey, honey
Where you been

Tell me, mister, have you seen
The girl they call the Delta Queen
In New Orleans

He said, I know the girl you mean
She's singing at the Delta Queen
Down Seventeen

And I when I saw here there
Tell the belle slide over here
I didn't mind the smokey room
Or the smell of stale perfume

I only know that she
Was made for making love to me
Just a woman tired of being alone
The one that I'm now taking home

(CHORUS)

She left her home in Baton Rouge
She only had one pair of shoes
What could she lose
The time had come for her to chose
Between the good life and the blues
What could she do

Hey, I only know that she
Was made for making love to me
Just a woman tired of being alone
The one that I'm now taking home

(CHORUS) 2X to fade
