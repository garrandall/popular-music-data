Tonite, tonite
While I'm holding you so near
Tonite, tonite
What I'd give if I could hear

Those three little words
That would thrill the heart of me
Just whisper 'shhhh... I love you'
And will eternally

Tonite, tonite
More than any time before
This heart of mine
Seems to need you so much more

The touch of your lips
The thrill of your embrace
Keeps saying that
No one will ever take your place
While looking up above
I wished upon a star
And prayed for a blessing from above

Well if my wish should come true
Until our life is through
I'll have you near to have to hold and to love

Well, tonite, tonite
May never reach an end
I'll miss you so
Til you're in my arms again

With all of my heart
I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever
As I love you tonight

Tonite, tonite
May never reach an end
I'll miss you so
Til you're in my arms again

With all of my heart
I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever
As I love you tonight
