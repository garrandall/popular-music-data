Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people
But I can tell you, people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon
Down Savannah way

They robbed a store
And high-tailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
Reach for the sky!
Sweet talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars
In the dewlap bag

Now one brave man
He tried to take them alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home

Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun

They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside them they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew

Acting upon reliable information
A Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together
They died
