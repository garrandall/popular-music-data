Dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do


I had him where I wanted him
He was saying he'd be mine
And none could take my place
And I laughed in his face


Well, I made some goofs
But this one tops them all
So I think I'll go bang
My head against the wall


Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...


I had him where I wanted him
He was giving me his heart
And begging me to stay
And I just walked away


Well, gee, now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain


Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...


I couldn't see the
Forest through the trees
The boy I loved was
Down on his knees
And I played the game
And acted like a tease
Somebody kick me, please


Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...


Now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain


Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Goofy little girl

Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Silly little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Stupid little girl

Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Stupid little girl...
