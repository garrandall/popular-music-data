I got a rocking chair that rock
I got a rubber ball that roll
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

A boy need a girl
She need a ring that's made of gold
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

I don't need no woman
I don't need her because she's fine
I need a girl, a sweet little thing
To love me all the time

Fire makes things hot
I know ice keep em cold
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

A whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul
Whole lotta woman
Man, can satisfy my soul

I don't need no woman
I don't need her because she's fine
I need a girl, a sweet little thing
To love me all the time

Fire makes things hot
I know ice keep em cold
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

A whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul
Whole lotta woman
Man, can satisfy my soul

If you get cold
A coat will keep you warm
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

A boy need a girl
She need a ring that's made of gold
But I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

A whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
I don't need a woman
Just because she's fine

A whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul
I need a whole lotta woman
To satisfy my soul

Somebody help me
You got to help me
I need a woman
Whole lotta woman

Somebody help me
You got to help me
I need a whole lotta woman
Whoa, oh, oh

Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
You got to help ne
You got to help me

I need a woman
Whole lotta woman...
