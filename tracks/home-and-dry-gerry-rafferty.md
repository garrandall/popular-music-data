This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean, way above the clouds I come stealing
Feeling tired, but I feel good
'Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you and I know how you'll be feeling

I got to see you, I got to be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's got to be you, it's got to be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you every day

Way up here, above this timeless sea
I realize just what it is you mean to me
You give me something when I thought that everything we had was dying
I needed reason just to make me carry on
Well, I know better now, I know where I belong
I can't imagine how I ever let myself just give up trying

I got to see you, I got to be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's got to be you, it's got to be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you every day

Oh, yes, home and dry

Ain't nothing up here gonna slow me down
You know I never ever take the long way 'round
I think of you, 'cause I know how you'll be feeling
This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
â€˜Cross the ocean, way above the clouds I come stealing

I got to see you, I got to be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's got to be you, it's got to be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you every day

Oh, yes, home and dry
