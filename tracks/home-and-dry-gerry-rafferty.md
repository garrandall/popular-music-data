This silver bird takes me âcross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
âCross the ocean, way above the clouds I come stealin'.

Feelin' tired, but I feel good
Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you, and I know how you'll be feelin'.

I gotta see you, I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday.

Way up here above this timeless sea
I realize just what it is you mean to me
You give me somethin' when I thought that everything we had was dyin'.

I need a reason just to make me carry on
Well I know better now, I know where I belong
I can't imagine how I ever let myself just give up tryin'.

I gotta see you, I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday.

Oooooh, yes home and dry.

Ain't nothin' up here gonna slow me down
You know I never ever take the long way âround
I think of you, cause I know how you'll be feelin'.

This silver bird takes me âcross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
âCross the ocean, way above the clouds I come stealin'.

I gotta see you, I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday.

Oooooh, yes home and dry.
