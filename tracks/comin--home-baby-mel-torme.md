(Do-do-do)
I'm comin' home, baby, now
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm comin' home now, right away
(Do-do-do)
I'm comin' home, baby, now
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm sorry now I ever went away
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Every night and day I go and stay

I'm comin' home, baby
(Come on home)
I'm comin' home, baby, now
(You know I'm waitin' here for you)
I'm comin' home now, real soon
(You've been gone)
Comin' home, baby
(You don't know what I'm goin' through)
I'm comin' home, I know I'm overdue
(Since you went away)
Expect me any day, now, real soon
I'm comin' home

(Come on home)
Comin' home, baby, now
(You know I'm prayin' every night)
That everything is gonna be fine
(Please come home)
Comin' home, baby, now
(I want to feel you hold me tight)
Expect to see me now, anytime
(When I'm in your arms, I'm all right)
When you're in my arms, I'll be fine

(Come on home)
Comin' home, baby, now
(You know I'm counting everyday)
I'm comin' home now, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Use the phone)
I'm comin' home, baby, now
(And, baby, let me hear you say)
I'm comin' home, you're hearin' what I say
(That you're comin' home, I will lay awake)
And I never will go away
I'm comin' home

(Come on home)
Comin' home, baby, now
(You know I'm waitin' at the door)
They can't hold me back now, no more
(I'm alone)
I'm pressin' on, baby, now
(And pacing up and down the floor)
Oh, hear me holler, and hear me roar
(Say you'll be with me)
Gonna be with you ever more
I'm comin' home

(Come on home)
I'm comin' home, baby, now
(Oh baby, say you're comin' home)
That's what I say, I say I'm comin' home
(Something's wrong)
The road is long, baby, now
(You ought to either write or phone)
I'm comin' home and never more to roam
(Baby, tell me you're comin' home)
Baby, I'm for sure comin' home
You know I'm here to stay

Oh, I'm comin' home
Oh Lord, I'm comin' home
(You don't know what I'm going through)
You don't know what I'm going through
(Come on home)
Oh oh, I'm comin'
Oh oh, I'm comin' home
I say you'll be with me
(You don't know what I'm going through)
You don't know what I'm going through
(Come on home)
I'm comin' home
(Come on home)
You don't, you don't...
(You don't know what I'm going through)
I'm comin' home to you
