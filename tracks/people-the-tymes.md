Everybody's got to have somebody
Everybody's got to have someone

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

Children, needing other children
And then letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Everybody's got to have somebody
Everybody's got to love someone

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
If one person, one very special person

With that feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
When now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people

People who need people, yeah
Are the luckiest, luckiest
People in the world

Everybody's got to have somebody
Everybody's got to love somebody

People got to have somebody
People got to have somebody
They're the luckiest people
In the world

With that feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
When now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people

People who need people, yeah
Are the luckiest, luckiest
People in the world

Everybody's got to have somebody
I need me somebody
Got to have somebody
I need me somebody
Got to have somebody
Oh, I need me somebody, yeah
