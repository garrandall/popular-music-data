Some people talk about my guy
They say he always acts so shy
But I tell you truthfully
When he's all alone with me
He's a lover, yeah

(He's a lover)
He's kind of quiet in a crowd
He never likes to come on loud
But when all the people go
& We turn the lights down low
He's a lover, yeah

When we're alone, he knows the sweetest things to say
He holds me close & loves me in his own sweet way

(He's a lover)
So let them talk about my guy
& Let them think he's kind of shy
But I love him like he is
& The secret's mine & his
He's a lover, yeah

(Sax solo, with backup singing title twice)

(Repeat bridge & verse 3)

(Oh yeah) my sweet lover
(Oh yeah) quiet lover
(Oh yeah) sweet sweet lover
