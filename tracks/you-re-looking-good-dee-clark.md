Little girl, where did you come from?
Don't you know
That we could have a lot of fun?
You just moved into my neighborhood
But you oughta be in-a Hollywood

An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good

You're not very tall
But you're stepping high
Eyeballs flashin'
As you walk by

The cats on the block
Wanna know your name
But I was here first
Ain't that a shame?

An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good

Hey!

Two an two is four
One an one is two
Ev'ryone's got their eyes on you

Look at those measurements
Man alive!
34-24-35

An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good

FADES-

You're lookin'
Go-oo-oo
Ooo-oo-oh
Oh-oo

~
