I've been down so long
I've been hurt for so long
There were times I thought I'd never so the break of day
It was hard for me to see your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always


But night after night
Night after night
Night after night
I pray Lord, don't take Your joy from me
Then late one night I read in Your love letter that it's gonna get better


Don't you know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You


When my enemies, tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was coming to an end
All the while You knew
That I would make it through
I feel closer to You now than I was when I first began


Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
You are my sunlight after the rain
Wherever You are
I just wanna be near You
I'm so glad I can hear You


Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You


Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh


Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are
You are my sunlight after the rain
Wherever You are
I just wanna be near You
I so glad I can hear You


Don't You know that
I've been looking for You
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

Oh oh
Oh oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh)
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh oh
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
