I still can remember
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end
I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me
And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends
Tried to1et you go
But I can't, you  know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me
Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy,
When there's so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'Cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning upside down
You'll always belong to me
(Comin' in and out of your life)
Isn't easy,
When there's so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you
I can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember...
