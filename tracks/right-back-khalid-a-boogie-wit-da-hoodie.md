On Goyard luggages, I'm blowin' your budget
How you gon' tell me I'm bugging when I came from nothing?
Even if you don't love me, don't change for nothing
Why would you lie with me?


You keep some lighters in your bag
Couple of grams in my lap
We'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone


If I ever call you my baby, girl, I mean you're really my baby
And I can't, can't even stop
Thinkin' 'bout you, I'm addicted, I swear I ain't even tripping
'Cause you could've been (Yeah)
Bartendin', you could've been stripping or even (Yeah)
Out here, fucking somebody just to get even
'Cause no matter where I go, you think I'm cheating
I know you miss me girl, 'cause my diamonds shine bright like the moonlight, yeah
You ain't gotta get you red eye, fly anytime, yeah
It's only one flight away, you can spend the night, yeah
I could treat you right, I swear I'll treat you right, yeah
You don't even try no more, just write me
On my private jet, flying, nigga, invite me
Sent you heart eyes but you never respondin'
Never wrote back but I seen you typing


You keep some lighters in your bag
Couple of grams in my lap
We'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone
Another day gone, another day gone, hmm


I know you stay up in your bag
You got a couple of bands in your stash
Feel like you losing
Feel like you losing your mind, so sad
Why is that?
Another day gone and your time
And you need love in your life
So you keep moving
Picking and chosing those guys
Heart of your mind (So sad)


You keep some lighters in your bag
Couple of grams in my lap
We'll keep grooving
You keep wasting your time worried 'bout
Worried 'bout another day gone
But you got God on your side, so you keep moving
You keep wastin' your time rightin' your wrongs
Another day gone, another day gone
