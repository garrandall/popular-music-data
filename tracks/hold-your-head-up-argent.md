Penance left unpaid
Before thee manifests
And empty lies a grave
For he who never rests
Tempering his blade
We kneel at his behest
As the sky grows ever sullen
With a culling are we blessed

Hahahaha... They say God rested on the seventh day...
You know what he really did?
He created Hell...

"Let there be light", what a dumb quote
Thinkin' of puttin' up a fight? Just don't
I'll hold an audition for my next victim
But careful 'cuz the competition is cutthroat
You got a neck that I wanna get my mitts on
Spin your head around as if it was a twist-off
You oughtta worship the soil that I piss on
Let alone the ground I left my footprints on
I came to raze hell, and leave it laid to waste
You're overdue for it Lucifer, you ain't savin' face
I'm a one-man show, but if I started a band
You bet your ass that I'm makin' Satan play the bass
I'll ignore every single borin' divine thing
Rip-roarin' like I'm Mick Gordon on a nine-string
Totally unholy, and impure - diseased
With demons that wanna lock me down in quarantine
'Cuz I'm their cleanser, offender of sins unimagined
I entered their kingdom, when I left it was ravaged
And yet they're lookin' up to me like a false idol
Shotgun on my side is my Bible

The gates of hell embrace you, welcome home
(Fall from grace, weary angel)
Let your hatred swell with rage unquelled, unbroken
(Spare your faith, shed your halo)

I may detest decadence, but check my merch
Purely cosmetic, yet I'm so sexy that it hurts
Even if you demons are atheist, let me spit a verse
Then I'll make you believe in me, and after you'll head to church
Satan, sorry, you've been laid off
Get to workin' on your resume
As I'm revvin' up my chainsaw
You know Hell has definitely seen better days
Forget heaven, let me revel with rebels
But I never been one to meddle with devils
That was a lie, and you'll find no better example
Than the plentiful Argent energy that I have embezzled
As I descend the depths, all that's left behind me is leveled
I'm spreadin' like a sickness, your impish blood is my vessel
I'll get from zero to a hundred when I step on the pedal
And then I'm grapplin' upward, and at the top will I settle
And if you sing my praises, make it a song that is metal
You'll only touch my blade when into your neck is it nestled
'Cuz I am entropy personified, Sentinel-qualified
Hell-Raisin', bell-ringin', Doom Slayer - bonafide

The gates of hell embrace you, welcome home
(Fall from grace, weary angel)
Let your hatred swell with rage unquelled, unbroken
(Spare your faith, shed your halo)
The Bible tells such lies - the bells are tollin'
(Keepin' demons abound)
And where embers dwell, remember well to stoke them
(You've found a home in Hell)

In your Eternal glory
You fester with a fearsome infection
Even a heart so pure, distorted
By the violence behind good intentions
The gods and devils have all heard the story
Of the one who will cross the dimensions
Through Heaven and Hell, and worlds of purgatory
You burn with unholy ascension

Now that the gates of Hell are unlocked
Magazines are fully loaded, guns cocked
They told me I'd be king when Hell froze over
So did anybody notice that the temp just dropped?
I am your nightmare, I am infernal
I'll strike fear in you, 'cuz fear is universal
I'm an amalgamation of Hell's nine circles
I am your Doom, I am Eternal

The gates of hell embrace you, welcome home
(Fall from grace, weary angel)
Let your hatred swell with rage unquelled, unbroken
(Spare your faith, shed your halo)
The Bible tells such lies - the bells are tollin'
(Keepin' demons abound)
And where embers dwell, remember well to stoke them
(Now that you've found a home in Hell)
(I'm headed home to Hell)
