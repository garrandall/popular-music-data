What little girl's gonna hold me tight
(I'll be the girl to hold you tight)
What little girl's gonna kiss me right
(I'll be the girl to kiss you goodnight)

What little girl's gonna share my dream
Wear the crown of my teenage queen
What little girl's gonna love me so
(I'll be the girl but you gotta say so)

There's nothing special she must be
Except to just be mine
There'll never be no jealousy
As long as she loves me all the time

When will I know what girl's for me
(You'll only know when the girl says so)
Who is the girl who's meant for me
(I'm your girl, oh, don't you know)

Oh, now that I found her
I won't ever, ever let her go
Cause now I know what girl's for me
(All of the girls are meant for you)

There's nothing special she must be
Except to just be mine
There'll never be no jealousy
As long as she loves me all the time

When will I know what girl's for me
(You'll only know when the girl says so)
Who is the girl who's meant for me
(I'm your girl, oh, don't you know)

Oh, now that I found her
I won't ever, ever let her go
Cause now I know the girl for me
(All of the girls are meant for you)
