Engine, engine #9, can you get me back on time? 
Move on, move on down the track 
Keep that steam comin' out the stack 
Keep on movin, keep on movin', keep on movin', ow!

Engine, engine #9, keep on movin' down the line 
Seem like I've been gone for days 
I can't wait to see my baby's face 
Look here, been so long since I have, been so long, since I have

Been so long since I have, been so long since I kissed her 
Engine, engine #9, move on, move on down the line 
Seem like I've been gone for days 
I can't wait to see my baby's face 
Move on, move on, ow! Move on, ow! 
Get go on about it, gotta get there, ow hah! Ah!

Ah, that sounded all right; I think I'm gonna hold it a bit longer 
I wanna let the boys do this a little bit!
