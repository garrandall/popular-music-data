You're a sweet sweetheart
You've been a real good friend
You're around when I'm down
You pick me up again
Thought it could never be said
To my faults, you're blind
You overlook the bad
While you keep all the good in mind

Now there've been times when
We just couldn't get on
And I thought I'd have to admit
The feeling was gone

But you just closed your mind
To all the seeds of doubt
And somehow, you found a way
To make it all work out



And when I come home
At the close of another day
You got a way of looking
Sends a message my way

What this message means
Any old fool could see
And the thing that makes me feel good
You mean it just for me



Sweet, sweet, sweetheart
You're my friend
You're around when I'm down
You pick me up again
