I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five


I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits


'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that


Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah


It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze


And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just a-have to quit 'em if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that


Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah


Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand a-feedin' me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light


And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that


Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah


Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah


I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Go on with you like that
Oh yeah
Takin' me back
