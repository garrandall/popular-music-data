Take it off, I wanna love ya
And everybody wanna touch ya
You're moving right, wanna see whats up under
Then back it up, beep beep, like a trucker
Nice thighs, nice waist, and you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter, I'm about to make your pocket fatter

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, God damn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, God damn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you

Got my shades on, with my Jays on, in the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty outta control
Then she go up and down the pole
Which one Ima take home, get my freak on
If you aint freakin, we aint speakin
You think I'm playing (No, I'm Not)
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air
Baby don't worry about your hair, all those tracks
I don't give a damn about that
In the club, they're playing my song
Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can and you know you can
Ima give you all this money, money, money

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you

Pants, shirt, you can take it off
Panties, bra, you can take it off
Red bottom heels, you can take em, wait wait, leave em on cause I like my women tall
You got it hot mama, you're hotter than sauna
I wanna peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason why I dress you in that designer, is to get you out that Dolce and Gabbana
I throw this money up, she watch it all fall
Toot that thang up,
Anything you want baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Mrs. McCall

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you
