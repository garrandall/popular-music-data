Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on
Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on
Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
And everybody there tries to put my Sloopy down
Sloopy I don't care what your daddy do
'Cause you know Sloopy girl I'm in love with you
And so I'm singing...

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah...)

Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it hang down on me
Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it hang down on me

Come on Sloopy Come on, come on
Come on Sloopy Come on, come on
Well come on Sloopy Come on, come on
Well come on Sloopy Come on, come on
Well it feels so good Come on, come on
You know it feels so good Come on, come on

Well shake it, shake it, shake it Sloopy Come on, come on
Well shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Yeah...
