I can´t get off my high horse
And I can´t let you go
You are the one who
You are the one who makes me feel
So real, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, what am I supposed to do
Oh, what am I supposed to do, baby
When I´m so hooked up on you
Then I realize
Oh, I realize
That you are somebody else´s guy
Oh yeah
Why you wanna do this to me boy?
(Somebody else´s guy)


Can you remember the times we spent together
Sharing our days in the sun
Then I found out that you were somebody else´s lover
After all the plans we made, now were shattered


Still I can´t get off my high horse
I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
Then I realize that you´re somebody else´s guy


That day in September, I´m sure you can remember
That´s when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi
But baby yet I still cared


You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And realize you´re somebody else´s guy




You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go l
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And realize that you´re somebody else´s guy
