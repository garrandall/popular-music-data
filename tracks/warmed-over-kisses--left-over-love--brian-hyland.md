I see I've gotta be headin' for pain
I see a broken heart wearin' my name
You're handin' me, sure as stars up above
Warmed over kisses, left over love

You've got another love you're runnin' to
You've been a-cheatin' in some rendezvous
You're handin' me, sure as stars up above
Warmed over kisses, left over love

You say that I'm the only one
Oh how I wanted to be
But when I kiss your pretty lips
You got nothin' left for me

You've gotta wanna be breakin' my heart
I know we've gotta be driftin' apart
You're handin' me, sure as stars up above
Warmed over kisses, left over love

You're handin' me, sure as stars up above
Warmed over kisses, oo, left over love
