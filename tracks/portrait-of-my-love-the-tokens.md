There could never be
A portrait of my love
For nobody can paint a dream
You will never see
A portrait of my love
For miracles are never seen

Anyone who sees her
Soon forget the Mona Lisa
It would take I know, a Michaelangelo
And he would need the glow of dawn
That paints the skies above
To try and paint a portrait of my love

Anyone who sees her
Soon forget the Mona Lisa
It would take I know, a Michaelangelo
And he would need the glow of dawn
That paints the skies above
To try and paint a portrait of my love

To try and paint a portrait of my love
Love
Love...
