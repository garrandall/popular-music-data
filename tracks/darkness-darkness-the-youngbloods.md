Darkness darkness be my pillow
Take my hand let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
Darkness darkness hide my yearning
For the things that cannot be
Keep my mind from constant turning
Toward the things that cannot see (no, no)

Darkness darkness long and lonesome
With the day that brings my happiness
I have found the edge of silence
Oh I am in depths of fear
Darkness darkness be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away take away the pain of your way
Fill the emptiness with light (na na na na)

Darkness darkness be my pillow
Take my hand let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
Darkness darkness hide my yearning
For the things that cannot be
Keep my mind keep my mind from constant turning
Toward the things that cannot see
