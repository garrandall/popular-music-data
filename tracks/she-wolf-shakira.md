S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me,
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy.
Moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body is craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
Starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office, ah
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer to get me a lover and tell you about it

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set it free 
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breathe 

Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey,
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way.
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent,
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student.

To locate the single man I've got on me a special radar,
And the fire department's hot line in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divas or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
I'm having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Open up and set it free 
There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breathe 

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise 
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she wolf in the closet,
Let it out so it can breathe
