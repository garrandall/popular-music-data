Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten;
Together we've climbed hills and trees,
Learned of love and A-B-C's,
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.

Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that spring is in the air,
Pretty girls are everywhere;
Think of me and I'll be there.

We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the hills that we climb
Were just seasons out of time.

Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me,
I was the black sheep of the family;
You tried to teach me right from wrong,
Too much wine and too much song,
Wonder how I got along.

Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that spring is in the air,
Little children everywhere,
When you'll see them, I'll be there.

We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the wine and the song,
Like the seasons are all gone.


Goodbye, Rochelle, my little one,
You gave me love and helped me find the sun;
And every time that I was down,
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground.

Goodbye, Rochelle, it's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that spring is in the air,
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there.

We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach.


We had joy, we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the wine and the song,
Like the seasons are all gone.

All our lives we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the hills that we climb
Were just seasons out of time.
