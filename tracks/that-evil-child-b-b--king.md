Whenever I try to hold my baby,
She just stand there for a while
No matter how I try to please that woman,
She won't even crack a smile
Lord, maybe you in heaven can help me,
'cause this is one evil child
Oh, I say maybe, maybe somebody can help me,
Because this is one evil child

When I buy her flowers or candy she just looks at me and growls,
She say, "You must be guilty or have a guilty conscience buddy",
Because I'm convicted without a trial
She just grunts when I call baby, hm one evil child
I said, "Lord, maybe you can help me, because she's a strange and evil child"

Still, I'm tryin' to please my woman but she 'bout to drive me wild
I buy her hundred dollar dresses, people,
Still she complains about the style
Won't somebody give me a suggestion?
Help me with this evil child
Oh, maybe the Lord in heaven above can help me
