Hammerin' a nail, stackin' them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's gettin' ready, I'm gassin' up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed


The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here


Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight


Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here (Come on)


Yeah, that's how we do it round here
Yeah, that's how we do it round here
