Wait baby, listen you got me twistin' watching you sippin' on that drink
I saw you smile back and I didn't miss that "it's on a little later on" wink
And your song comes on, you dance along
I can't believe how bad you got me like

Dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around, baby 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night, yeah but that's alright
'Cause girl you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum

Baby you're rockin' you got me locked in
I know that you're dancing just for me
If you wanna go then well get to rollin'
'Cause I'd love to sweep you off your feet

Like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around baby, 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night, yeah but that's alright
'Cause girl you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum

Yeah, if you wanna take me home and turn it on
You know I'm there cause girl I swear

Dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
Mmm gon' let your long hair down, baby down, baby down
We'll be loving til the sun comes back around, baby 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night, yeah but that's alright
'Cause girl you got me like dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum

Girl you got me like dayum baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout call me maybe,
I'm fallin' talkin' crazy, but I gotta call a spade what a spade is,
Babygirl now you my queen, I got a pocket full of aces,
I'm a get you hot, I'm a fly you to your favorite places,
Chasin' your dreams, so real that you can almost taste it,
I'm a take you back to the basics, we gon' cover all of the bases,
And I'm a lay you down and take my time 'til you can hardly take it

Dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
