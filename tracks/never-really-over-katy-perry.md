I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And I do I do
But once in a while I trip up and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the Internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And I do I do
But once in a while I trip up and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time
Was the last, but
I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
And I guess it's never really over

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again (again, over and over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time
Was the last, but
I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
And I guess it's never really over

I guess it's never really over, mmm...
