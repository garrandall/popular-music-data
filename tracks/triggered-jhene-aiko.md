Go figure
You were the trigger
You brought me to an obstructed view
When you knew the picture was bigger
Who am I kiddin'?
Knew from the beginning
You'd ruin everything, you do it every time
You are my enemy, you are no friend of mind, muhfucker

You muhfuckin' right
You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I

Wanna fuck you right now
I just turned the lights out now
And you know when the sun go down
That's when it would all go down
Been a minute, been a while
Ain't let nobody hit it since you hit it
You know you always know what to do wit' it
But ain't no me and you without you in it
Damn, I'm 'bout to burn this bitch down
I think I need to lie down
'Cause I'm not tryna wild out now
But right now

Don't know what I'm capable of
Might fuck around and go crazy on cuz
Might fuck around, have to pay me in blood
This ain't the way that you want it
Might catch a case in this bitch
Don't let me catch you face-to-face in this bitch
Tryin' my hardest not to disrespect you
After what you did, man, what you expected?
You muhfucker

You muhfuckin' right
You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I
Tryna let the time fly (Yeah)
Tryna let the time go by
Tryna let the time heal all
(T-tryna let the time heal all)


Who the hell you think you playin wit'
I'ma pull up to yo session
I'ma pull up to yo crib
I'ma
Black car with the tint
Just to make sure you ain't lyin'
Doin' what you did
You fuckin' with my mental health
I ain't feelin' myself
Say it once, say it twice, I ain't feelin' myself
If you lyin', nigga, then I'm slidin', nigga
If you love me , then provide that, nigga
Got the baddest bitch 'bout to slip away
You can feel it in the fuck
You can see it in my face
I might pull the trigger, I might kill this nigga
Talkin' to the lord while I'm sippin on the liquor
Playin' with the poison, mixture
Doin' crazy shit cuz I can feel the wraith shoot
All my bitches know that and all my bitches feel this
Don't forget, I'm the top of every nigga's wishlist, nigga (Icy)


I'm triggered, when I see your face
Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay
You need to stay out my way
I'm triggered, when I see your face
Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay (Yeah)
You need to stay out of my way
You need to stay out of my way (Yeah)
You need to stay out of my way, yeah
Oh oh-oh-oh, ayy, yeah
