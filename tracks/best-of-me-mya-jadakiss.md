Uh, huh 
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha (whoa)
Yo, yo 


You put me on
I can't let let him go no
Can't let you get, oh no


He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Racks up on the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash watch girls wild out
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace 
Replace the man that waits at home for me


Oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
I know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
The best of me



So busy trying to play with my head
Telling me how he could blow my mind
Something about the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hands up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night




Yo yo yo I got so many bags of money
That they won't fit in the bank
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'mma make sure both y'all win
Let him keep the place you move
And I'mma pay both y'alls rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge
You know literally we can go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she don't wanna get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look
Chanel look mixed with the Pete Arnell look
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty we living it up
I put it on your ass if you giving up
And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you can call him later
And tell him you all Jada's


Oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me



Oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
Oh yeah, oh...
