Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're a bad little girl, it's true
But I'm not gonna walk out on you
They say you're a good for nothing, girl
But I'll stand up and tell the world

You're good for me, oh yes, you are
You're good for me
Oh, like a honey is good for the bee
You're good for me

You do two wrongs for every right
You put salt in my coffee just for a spite
You're no good for yourself
You're no good for nobody else

But you're good for me
Oh, you're good for me
Oh, sugar dumpling, can't you see
You're good for me

Let me tell you 'bout it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, woah, oh, oh, ooh

I was down on my sickbed
It was the end for me everyone said
Doctor Jones did all he could
Only your love did me some good

You're good for me oh, yes, you are
You're good for me
Like the sugar is good for the tea
You're good for me

That's all I'm living for
'Cause you're good

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, woah, oh, oh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, woah, oh, oh, ooh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
