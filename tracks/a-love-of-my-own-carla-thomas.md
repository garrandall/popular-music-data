I look at the mountain, I look at the sun
I look at everything Mother Nature has done
Then I wanna know
Why can't I find a love of my own

I look at the skyline, I look at the trees
I look at the moonlight, I feel the soft breeze
Then I wanna know
Why can't I find a love of my own

Love, how I've waited for you
But it looks like you'll never come
So I sit down, sit down and think this thing over
Is it something I've done?

I look at the flowers in fullest bloom
I should be happy but I'm filled with gloom
'Cause I wanna know
Why can't I find a love of my own

'Cause I wanna know
Why can't I find a love of my own
