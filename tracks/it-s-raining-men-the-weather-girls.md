Hi! Hi! We're your weather girls
(Uh huh)
And have we got news for you!
You better listen
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright


Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)
According to all sources (What sources now?)
The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men


It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean


God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy


It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!


I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin
Hear the thun-der
Don't you lose your head!
Rip off the roof and stay in bed


God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men! Yeah


Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men


It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
(Tall, blonde, dark and lean)
(Rough and tough and strong and mean)
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
(It's Raining Men! Hallelujah!)
(It's Raining Men! Hallelujah!)
