I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you


Little girl, again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me, your best friend
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you'll look in my eyes
And one more time you won't realize


That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
Love me (I'm the one who loves you)
I'm the one who loves you


I must confess you're not to be blamed
For being caught in those boys' vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact
I'm going to stop the blueness in you
Also confess what my heart wants me to


That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
A love me (I'm the one who loves you)
I'm the one who loves you


Yes, once more you'll look in my eyes
And one more time you won't realize
That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
A love me (I'm the one who loves you)
Little girl, I'm the one who loves you
Mama, I'm the one
Let's twist a while
I'm the one who loves you
Yeah, I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, baby
I'm the one who loves you
