Looking in your eyes
I see a memory
Of how it used to be
Before our world came tumbling down

I try
I did nothing else
But try to keep our love alive
Oh, how I loved you so
And you just made me cry

Did you deceive me?
Did you do me wrong?
Boy, I can`t take it
Can`t take it anymore

I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
Do I keep on crying?
Or do I leave you?


Boy, I`ve been told
Leaving you is the thing to do
It would be easy
If I didn`t want to start anew

Boy, I`ve been told
Leaving you is the thing to do
It won`t be easy
Cause breaking up is hard to do


Touch this lonely heart
As I try to say to you
About the things you do
Now I`m alone
Dissatisfied

Did you deceive me?
Did you do me wrong?
Boy, I can`t take it
Can`t take it anymore

I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
Do I keep on crying?
Or do I leave you?




Just like my friend said
You were never good for me
So just go about your way
Don`t worry about me
And just forget we ever happened

The time has come to say goodbye
Don`t ask why
Just let it all go
I`ve made it through
There`s someone new
