I watch the distant lights on the runway
Disappear into the evening sky
Oh you know I'm with you on your journey
Never could say goodbye

It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you I don't want you to

Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Time has come for you
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Time has come

For you to awaken in another country

Greet the morning under foreign skies
Leaving me to face another Monday
It's not easy to get by

It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you I don't want you to

Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Time has come for you
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Time has come for you
