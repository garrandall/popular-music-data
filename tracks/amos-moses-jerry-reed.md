Yeah here comes Amos
Now Amos Moses was a Cajun he lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligators for a livin' heâd just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law's gonna get ya Amos
It ain't legal huntin' alligators down in the swamp boy
Now everybody blames his old man for makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy his daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp ha ha ha
Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou
About forty five minutes southeast of Thibodaux Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groc'ries
Named him after the man of the cloth called him Amos Moses
Yeah ha ha

Now all the folks around south Louisiana said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest the meanest alligator and just use one hand
That's all he got left cause the alligator bit him ha ha ha
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow
Well the sheriff got wind that Amos was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp gonna get the boy but he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou
About forty five minutes southeast of Thibodaux Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groc'ries
Named him after a man of the cloth called him Amos Moses
Sit down on 'em Amos make it count son
About forty five minutes southeast of Thibodaux Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
