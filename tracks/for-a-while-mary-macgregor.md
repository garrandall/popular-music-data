I think I'll stay around here for a while
I like your way of talking and your smile
I think I've played around enough
With boys who think they're acting tough
I think I'm running for your style
... For a while

Log on to hide ad.

I like the way you hold me like a child
Might even let you tame my runnin' wild
Even if it's not forever
It feels good to be together
We've got so much love to share
... While it's there

I've been treated like a little girl
Who still believes in Cinderella's world
But I don't want to dream or fantasize
When I'm making love to you
I won't close my eyes

I like the way you always take your time
You give me what a woman wants to find
I don't want your rhymes or reasons
I just know your touche is pleasing
Just don't ask me why or how
... Have me now

I'll stay... for a while
