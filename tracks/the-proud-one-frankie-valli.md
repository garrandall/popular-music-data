Livin' (livin') is dyin' (dyin') 'cause love you left me cryin'
Now there's no use tryin' to go on
Each night and day baby
Pretendin' there'll be a happy endin'
Burning down deep inside
Got a heart break that I can't hide

I'm not the proud one
I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby please
You're the proud one
Believe me
This big man is down on his knees
Baby please

Oh baby (baby), remember (baby), when you were warm and tender
Beggin' me surrender to your charm
You gave me your sweet lips
Said use them
Oh, why did I abuse them
Didn't know good from bad
Girl I didn't know what I had

I'm not the proud one
I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby please
You're the proud one
Believe me
This big man is down on his knees
Baby please

Oh baby I love you
Please come back
I need you
I need you

I'm not the proud one
I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby please
