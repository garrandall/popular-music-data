I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone

Up and at 'em bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed up for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for the money
There's bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory
I just do it anyway

Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah, I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be

I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekend's been too strong
I just work straight through the holidays
Sometimes all night long

You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey, I'm steady
Hey, I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty
No matter what the price
I've counted up the cost
I know the sacrifice

Oh, and I don't wanna die for you
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
'Cause freedom don't come free

I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
Sleep in peace tonight
American soldier, I'm an American soldier

Yeah, an American Soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
So sleep in peace tonight
American soldier, I'm an American, an American, an American soldier!
