Break break shake away
Break breakaway
Now I'm free to do what I want to do


Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why
I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I want to do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead


(Baby baby)
Found out it was in my head


And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm going to make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around


Come on we're free to breakaway
(Oh boy you jump for joy)
Now won't you come on
(When you breakaway)
You're free to breakaways
(Breakaway)


Feel the vibrations
In all the sensations
Breakaway
