I could have a mansion that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris
Oh, it's at my beck and call
Why do I go through life with nothing at all?

But when I dream
I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

I can be the singer or the clown in every room
I can even call someone to take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on and drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone and never know his name

But when I dream
I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

But when I dream
I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
