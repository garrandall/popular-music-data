I could build a mansion
That is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want
And never ask please

I could fly to Paris
It's at my beck and calls
Why do I live my life alone
With nothing at all

(But) when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

When I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

I can be the singer
Or the clown in any room
I can call up someone
To take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on
And drive the man insane
I can go to bed alone
And never know his name
