I know you've come
To tell me that it's over
Oh, oh, well, all right
I'll let you go free
But, baby
Thought it may be over for you
It'll never be over for me
Made up my mind
Not to start crying, oh, oh
But there's more
Than the eye can see
'Cause, baby, inside
My heart is breaking apart
'Cause it'll never be over for me
I'll know every time
I look up at a star, yeah, yeah
Your face is gonna come in view
And every time
The wild wind touches my lip
I'll think of your kiss
And feel so blue
If ever you find
That you were mistaken, oh, oh
No matter how long
That my heart beats
Just come on back
Oh, forget about everything, yes
'Cause it may be
May be over for you, yeah
But it'll never be over for me, oh, no
