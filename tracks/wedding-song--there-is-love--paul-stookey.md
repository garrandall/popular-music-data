He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts;
Rest assured, this troubadour is acting on His part
The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, there is love

Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home;
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one;
As it was in the beginning is now and 'til the end
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again, and there is love, there is love

Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife?
Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life?
Or if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for?
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?

Oh there's love, oh there's love

Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, oh there's love
