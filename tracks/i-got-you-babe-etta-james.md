Alright!

If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
Available for you to see
I'm about to go and then you'll know
For me to stay, I got to be me

You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my man takin' up my time

How could I ever allow? I guess I wonder how
Could you get out a pocket for fun
When you know that you're number two
Number one gonna be number one

I'll be good to you, I wish I could
I get this message over to you now, oh baby

When you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
I'll be so good, I wish, I could
Get the message over to you now

And if you want me to stay, baby, if you want me to stay
If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
Available for you to see
I'm about to go and then you'll know
For me to stay, I got to be me

You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay, hey babe

If you need me to stay
If you want me to stay, baby

Count the days I'm gone, baby
Count the days I'm gone, baby
Count the days I'm gone, yeah

Yeah, baby, I'll stay around if you want me, oh baby
If you want me, I'll be around
