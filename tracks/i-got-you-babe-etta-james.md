People say that we don't know
What love is or how to make it grow
Well, I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me and baby, I got you

Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe

Say, our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's sure, we don't have a lot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we've got

Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring, yeah
I've got you, I've got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And when I get scared, you're always around

Let them say we are wrong
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
But with our love like your's and mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
And I got you to talk with me

I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you, hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe
I got you, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe
