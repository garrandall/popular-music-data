Twenty five tons of hardened steel rolls on no ordinary wheel
Inside the armoured car ride two big armed guards
In a bullet-proof vest, shatterproof glass, overdrive, we're gonna pass
Twenty five tons of hardened steel rolls on no ordinary wheel
The hardest part of the armoured guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel

Nitro and acetylene open la machine
No short heist, no overnight, big money take you to Brazil
Bullet-proof vest, shatterproof glass, overdrive, we're gonna pass
Time bomb, greasy mob, count down, hurry up, come on

The hardest part of the armoured guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel

In a wire mesh cage with a twelve gauge. Radio - we're coming fast
Oh I need to feel some hardened steel, deliver the big money deal

Of the armoured guard here's what I heard
I'll tell you that he will no matter what you feel
The hardest part of the armoured guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel

Twenty five tons of hardened steel deliver the big money deal
