There were times I wasn't kind 
And there were times I wasn't even around 
And there were times I made you cry 
So many times I had to say goodbye 
When you want to talk 
I'm on the phone 
But now baby, yeah, I am here for you alone 

I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
'Cause I can't live my life alone 
Without a home 

There were times I didn't understand 
And there were times I wouldn't hold your hand 
But baby now I'm here for you 
'Cause baby, yeah, I am so in love with you 

I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
'Cause I can't live my life alone 
Without a home 

I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
'Cause I can't live my life alone 
Without a home, yeah 

I'm gonna stand, stand, by my woman now 
I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
'Cause I can't live my life alone 
Without a home 

Stand, yeah, by, yeah my woman now 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ... 
I'm gonna stand by my woman now 
'Cause I can't live my life alone 
Without a home
