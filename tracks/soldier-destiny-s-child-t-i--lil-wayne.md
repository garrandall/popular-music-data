Feat. T.I. & Lil Wayne)


Hey (I want a Soldier!)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
(I got a Soldier!)
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league
Please!


We like dem boys that be in them lac's leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that wheel clean and (Clean and)
(They always be talkin that country slang, we like)
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chiefin' (chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, wit street credibility


If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street


We like dem boys up top from the BK (BK)
Know how to put that money three ways (Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway (Freeway)
(Wit that east coast slang that us country girls be like)
Low cut caesars wit the deep waves (deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce (Beyonce)
Always comin down poppin our way (Our way)
(Tellin us that country girls the kinda girl they like)


If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street


I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
They wanna take care of me (Where they at)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
Wouldn't mind takin one for me (Where they at)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
Wouldn't mind puttin that on me (Where they at)


Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the lac'
A performed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier go to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothin' less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the wallet
It's a reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like, come on


If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street


I like dem boys over there they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homey in the dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight (On tonight)
Oh he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Every time he look at me my girls be like (Girls be like)
(That one may be the one tonight)


If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street


Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in harlem
Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she say whoomp


I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
They wanna take care of me (Where they at)
I Know Some Soldiers In Here (Where They At , Where They At)
Wouldn't Mind Takin One For Me (Where They At)
I Know Some Soldiers In Here (Where They At , Where They At)
They Wanna Spend That On Me (Where They At)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
Wouldn't mind puttin that on me (Where they at)
