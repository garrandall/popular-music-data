You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
Oh, oh, I love you


You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
You fell for me too


And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all


You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
We're in love, we two


Na, da-da, da-da-da
Na-da, da-da-da
Na-da, da-da-da
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
We're in love, we two
We're two


You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too

Now you love me too
Now you love me, too
Now you love me too
Now you love me, too
Now you love me too
Now you love me, too
