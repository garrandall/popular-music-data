Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
The clock up against the wall
Tells me our love
Will not last at all
With every beat of the
Minute hand that goes around
Tells me our love
Is just beaten down
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
My love for you was growing old
Oh, I tried and tried
Before it turned cold
Just like a clock
Bringing to wake the sleepy soul
To get ready to strive for his goal
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Oh, when I felt
My love and yours was not true
Well, right then I knew
I stopped loving you
And with every beat of that
Minute hand that goes around
Just like an old clock
Our love had run down
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Oh, when I felt
My love and yours was not true
Well, right then I knew, I knew
I had stopped loving you
And with every beat of that
Minute hand that goes around
Just like an old clock
Our love had run down
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
I said just like an old clock
Our love had run down
