Redman in the building
Yo Game what's good my nigga
Killa house
Black Wall Street what's hood
You already know I'm a do it like this my nigga 


Yo I've been hustlin' that's where the fuck Red been
It's Redman, infrared with the hairpin
Trigga when the red ring, I got bitches in Washington after my red skin
Red, that's the colour when it came out him
Red, that's the name of the Game album
Red, I wear black I look fly
Red, I'm getting head in the red eye
Red, put in work Red, keep the airport security on high red alert
Red, what's up red
You know red tow up
Red, the colour that Baby and Wayne throw up
Redman, the red necks they can't stand it
I got caught with their daughter red handed
Red, I'm not rich but the paper good
So bring it on a liner, big boy neighborhood 


Red, yeah yeah boy you know me
Red, that's the colour that my eyes be
Red, I'm on fire homeboy
And that's that the colour that'll show you that I'm hot 


You mention Redman the wrong way it's red dots
I put you in the sky nigga, red fox
Yeah Red Rum, clock out the red beam
Give you red wings and I ain't talking about the hockey team
I'm talking red rags hopping out of red rags
With a red bone can't wear any Sinbads
And I've been bad before Michael Jackson was
That's why the red album got a Michael Jackson buzz
I mean I should get a red Michael Jackson glove
And grab my dick, what's happening blood
Or you can catch me on the red carpet
Bitch rocking red bottoms, you can call her red scarlet
And just like the store you can be a red target
My shit butter, you ain't never seen red margarine
Red star with my face make 'em talk a lot
Shut they ass up, red robbies in the parking lot 


Red, yeah yeah boy you know me
Red, that's the colour that my eyes be
Red, I'm on fire homeboy
And that's that the colour that'll show you that I'm hot
