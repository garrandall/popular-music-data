Nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home, home, home, home


It's been a long night here and a long night there
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere
Hold up now
You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight, I gotta be like


Oh baby, nah baby
You got me all wrong, baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true


Now, better men than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
Now check it out
I got her and she got me and you got that ass
But I kindly gotta be like


Oh baby, nah baby
You got me all wrong, baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true


Oh, I'm sure you, sure you will make somebody's night
But oh, I assure you, assure you it sure as hell's not mine


Oh no, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
Nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
Nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I gotta bid you adieu, to another I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true, I will stay true
