Hi everybody, this is James Brown
Reminding you that you're listening to the swinginest station in the nation
I hope you love my newest record

Gather round, clap your hands
Come on and dance

Come on, hit it
Come on, hit it, hit it

Hit it
Come on, baby
Get in the groove
Come on, baby
Let's take it smooth on Hipster's
OW, Hipster's, Hipster's Avenue
Hit it

All these guys and girls
Are dressed so neat and clean
Come on, baby, yeah
Don't be so mean
Guys and girls, gather round
Come on everybody
And dig this sound, oh, oh...

Hit it, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up

Can you do the Jerk?
Watch me work
Can you do the Slide?
Watch me glide

Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up
Oh no, oh no, hit it
Bring it up, bring it up, baby
Bring it up, hey, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up, up, up
Oh, bring it up, come on, baby
Oh, bring it up, bring it on home
Bring it on home, where you belong
Don't you dare, don't take it nowhere
Baby, bring it up
