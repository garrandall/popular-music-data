Magic is the night, the stars are shining bright;
Angels above are singing of our love;
And they say you're the one I adore

Magic is the night, so baby hold me tight;
Oh, can't you see that we were meant to be;
Won't you show me the way to your heart

Say you'll be my baby, let me be your thrill;
I will always love you, you know I always will;
I'll never be unfaithful, I'll never tell you lies;
Please believe me darling, cross my heart and hope to die

(Repeat second verse)
