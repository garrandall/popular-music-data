I turn sideways to the sun 
keep my thoughts from everyone
It's a jungle, I'm a freak
Hear me talk, but never speak

So I'm stepping out of time
because breaking is a crime
And it may all be too late
but I've no passion for this hate

That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 
Can you feel it (can you feel it)
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)
how long would it last (that's the price of love)

And when this building is on fire
these flames can't burn any higher
I turn sideways to the sun
and in a moment I am gone

That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 
Can you feel it (can you feel it)
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)
how long would it last (that's the price of love)

That's the price of love (that's the price of love) 
Can you feel it (can you feel it)
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)
How long would it last (that's the price of love)
