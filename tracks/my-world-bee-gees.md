Don't shed a tear for me
No, it's not your style
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while


My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine


I've been crying, I'm lonely
What do I do to have you stay?
I've pleaded you to cry on
I've written to you nearly every day


My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine


Don't shed a tear for me
No, that's not your style
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while


My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine


I've been crying, I'm lonely
What do I do to have you stay?
I've pleaded you to cry on
I've written to you nearly every day

x3
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
