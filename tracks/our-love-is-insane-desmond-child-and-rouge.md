You've got me doing the craziest things
Up and turned me around and around and around
Like a yo-yo on a string
You've got me thinkin' the world's gonna end
Then you fill me with hope and love
And tear me down again

Oh, our love is insane
Things are up in the air
Then down on the ground with nowhere in between
Oh, our love is insane
I wouldn't give it up
No, not for anything

You've got me swearing
I'll walk out that door
Out of touch, out of time
Without a friend or a dime
I'm drawn to you once more

Oh, our love is insane
Things are up in the air
Then down on the ground with nowhere in between
Oh, our love is insane
I wouldn't give it up
No, not for anything

You soothe the wound then you break my heart in two 
Tell me to touch you then to take my hands off you (touch me, touch me)
We yakkity yak then for days you won't talk to me
Your honey's so sweet but you know that you're stinging
Stinging like a killer bee

Oh, our love is insane (you know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes)
Oh, our love is insane (you know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes) our love is insane

Oh, our love is insane (you know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes) oh, our love is insane
Oh, our love is insane (you know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes, yes)
(You know it is, yes, yes)
