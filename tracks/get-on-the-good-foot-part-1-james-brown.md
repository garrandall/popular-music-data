Qué pasa people, qué pasa ...Hit me!
Ooh!
Get on down like, unh!
I wanna get on the good foot
Ho! Good foot
I got to get on the good foot

Going down to the crib, let all hang out
Where soulful people knows what it's about
Going down to the crib and let it all hang out
Where soulful people knows what it's about
Where people do the sign and take your hands
And dancing to the music of James Brown Band, mmm

They're dancing on the good foot
I got to get on the good foot
Got to do it on the good foot
Do it with the good foot

Said the long-hair hippies and the afro Blacks
They all get together across the tracks
And they party, HO, on the good foot
You know they dance on the good foot
Dance on the good foot

Ain't nothing going on now but the rent
A whole lotta bills and my money's spent, mmm
And that's on my bad foot, whoa, unh
You know my face getting short and I got the blues
I got a funky job and i paid my dues on the good foot

Ho! On the good foot
I got to get on the good foot
Hey! On the good foot
Get on the good foot
Come over!

Hit it, Jab
You got to get it
Get it
Sharper now, unh!
Come on, get it
Hunh!

On the good foot
On the good foot
Ho! On the good foot
Get on the good foot
On the good foot
On the good foot
Ho! Get on the good foot
On the good foot
Bass! Bass!

Get it, Jab
Get it, Jab
Ho!
Now bass
Play on it now
Come on
Get it
Get it
Get on the good foot
Ooh!
I got to get on the good foot
Ooh!
Get on the good foot
Ho!
Take care of business, sister, I'm your fella
