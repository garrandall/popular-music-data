Chante's got a man at home and he's so good to me...
Verse: I'm sorry that- your man ain't home- and I'm sorry that yours left you
Alone. It's such a shame- your man is playing games- I heard you say that
Men are all the same, no, no, no,
(Break) That's not the truth girl cause I got proof girl(Oh I got proof
Girl) I got a man at home.

Chorus: Chante's got a man at home(I got a man)
It hurts me your man's
Leaving you all alone(hurts me to my heart) I can't help it that your baby
Daddy's(he's) creeping on ya,(oh) cheating on ya-- (oh, oh, oh)beating on ya-
Chante's got a man at home(but I got a man at home) and he's so good to me.

Verse: Now why'd you let'em beat you down-
What's up with that-
There's good men around-
Don't you know how beautiful you are inside girl-
And don't you let nobody go and steal your pride.
No, No it's not what you think girl, (break) That's not the truth girl (it's not the truth)
(Oh no, no, I got proof, I got a man at home) cause I got proof
Girl(Oh no but I got proof) I got a man at home. Waiting on me
Chorus: Chante's got a man at home- It hurts me your man's leaving you all
Alone- (it hurts me to my heart- I can't help it that your baby oh) I can't
Help it that your baby daddy's (your baby daddy) creeping out, cheating on
Ya, beating on ya- Chante's got a man at home(but I got a man at home)
And he's sure good to me.
Bridge: I once was where you are thought men were all the same-
But I never gave up hope and now my life has changed
LISTEN TO ME YEAH:
(Breakdown): One man out the door don't spoil, don't spoil
He always treats me right- we never fight- he sends me flowers- wines and
Dines me- took me home to meet his moma- how he loves me, yeah
I got mine so don't spoil it for the girls
Give it one more try before ya- before ya give up on love.
