In the shuffling madness
Of the locomotive breath
Runs the all-time loser
Headlong to his death
He feels the piston scraping
Steam breaking on his brow


Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
Oh-oh


He sees his children jumping off
At the stations - one by one
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun
He's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees


Old Charlie stole the handle and
The train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
Hey-hey

He hears the silence howling
Catches angels as they fall
And the all-time winner
Has got him by the balls
Oh, he picks up Gideon's Bible
Open at page one


I said, God, he stole the handle and
The train it won't stop goin'
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
