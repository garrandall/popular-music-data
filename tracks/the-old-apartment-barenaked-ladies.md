Broke into the old apartment
This is where we used to live
Broken glass, broke and hungry
Broken hearts and broken bones
This is where we used to live

Why did you paint the walls?
Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?

This is where we used to live
Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why did you keep the dish rack?
These things used to be mine
I guess they still are, I want them back

Broke into the old apartment
Forty-two steps from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow laneway filled with crooks
This is where we used to live

Why did they pave the lawn?
Why did they change the locks?
Why did I have to break in, I only came here to talk

This is where we used to live
How is the neighbour downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun

I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm
I'm happy there

But this is where we used to live
(I want them back)
Broke into the old apartment
(I want them back)

This is where we used to live
Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why did you keep the dish rack?
These things used to be mine
I guess they still are, I want them back

Broke into the old apartment
(I want them back)
This is where we used to live
(I want them back)
