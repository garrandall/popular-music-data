Little games are for little boys,
I'm growing up and changing all my toys,
Aeroplanes, motor cars, goldfish in old jam-jars,
I just don't play these games no more.
Little games are for little boys,
Loving games are for bigger boys,
Parties in Chelsea flats,
Mixing with kinky cats,
Are games I wanna play some more.

Oh what they're doing to me,
Darling it's so plain to see,
My temperature's rising,
But that's not surprising,
When you do what you do to me.

Little games are for little boys,
I found out there are other joys,
Marjory, Josephine, Susie and Catherine,
They help me in my little games.

Oh what they're doing to me,
Darling it's so plain to see,
My temperature's rising,
But that's not surprising,
When you do what you do to me.

Little games are for little boys,
I found out there are other joys,
Marjory, Josephine, Susie and Catherine,
They help me in my little games.

My, my, my, my, my, my, my,
Play my little games,
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
Say I need you, I need you...
