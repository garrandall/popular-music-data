Why you always got to be so cool
And why I always got to play your fool
You don't really know what life's about
Baby come and let your feelings out

Say you really want me
Don't keep it to yourself
Say you really need me
Just me and no one else
Say you really love me
Ooh let me know it's true
Say you really want me
The way that I want you tonight

You don't know a thing about romance
Deep inside you're scared to take the chance
'Cos love like this may never come again
Make your move or I'll be in the wind

I need somebody through the thick and the thin
'Cos I know the problems of today
The time is over now for playing those games
Lets take it all the way
