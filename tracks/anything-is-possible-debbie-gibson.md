Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything....
Is possible


Thought I couldn't slow him down
Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league
Wouldn't give me time of day
Thought he was like all the rest
Love her, leave her, no remorse
But I guess that I misjudged
And this thing just ran its course
He taught me


Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible...
Just put your mind to it
Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible

Break it down now.....

No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything...) No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything...) No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible
(Anything...) No matter what it is, it's possible
Say, anything is possible


Much to my surprise I felt
A warm, not cold vibe
When he looked in my eyes
(Oh yeah, it's possible)
His bad boy front not charm
Was his disguise
Oh whoa whoa
(Let me tell ya)
He read so much into me
Listened so attentively
He liked me, I rest my case
Wasn't just a pretty face


If you set your mind
You can do anything you want
Not every guy is a bad guy
Don't stereotype
'Cause this guy, he proved me wrong
(Anything is possible...)
He taught me:

Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it

If you put your mind
You know you can do anything,
Anything

Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
