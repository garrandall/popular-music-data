Sing it out
Boy, you've got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it out
Girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs

For every time, that they want to count you out
Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Sing it out
Boy, they're gonna sell what tomorrow means
Sing it out
Girl, before they kill what tomorrow brings

You've got to, make a choice
If the music drowns you out
And raise your voice
Every single time, they try and shut your mouth

Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out, for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Cleaned up, corporation progress
Dying in the process
Children that can talk about it
Living on the web ways
People moving sideways
Tell it 'til your last days
Buy yourself a motivation
Generation Nothing
Nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted
But a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to get away

Keep running!

Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

You got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
