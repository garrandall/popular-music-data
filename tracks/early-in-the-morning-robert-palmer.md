Oh, I bet
You were a virgin
'Til you let me
Oh, I miss
Your kiss
When you are gone

I was young and foolish
I didn't know what I was doing
I didn't know I'd lost you 'til you were gone
Oh, I miss your loving
When you are gone

Now I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover
I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover

Now I've got to
Get up early
Every morning
'Cause the early bird
Always catches the worm

Now I've got to get up
Every morning
Got to make up for the
Lesson I learned
Got to find me a lover
Who won't run for cover
Find me a lover
Who won't run for cover

Got to get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover
Now I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover

I was young and foolish
Didn't know what I was doing
Didn't know what I'd lost 'til you were gone
She had a pretty face
Drove me wild
I even wanted her to have my child

Now I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover
Now I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover
