Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why?
Mmm, why can't we live together?
Tell me why? Tell me why?
Mmm, why can't we live together?


Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?


No more wars, no more wars, no more war
Mmm, just a little peace in this world
No more wars, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world


Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?


Can't live, can't live
Can't live together
Can't live together


No matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said, no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother


Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?
