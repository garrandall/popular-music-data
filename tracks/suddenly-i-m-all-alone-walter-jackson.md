Suddenly, I'm all alone
Out of a clear blue sunny sky
The happy world I found
Came tumbling down
When you said goodbye

Suddenly, I'm all alone
And I found I don't know what to do
I pace the floor and cry
And I wonder why
My love fell through

I was a king, with everything
'Til I fell from my throne

My honour used to be
And suddenly, I'm I'm all alone

Only yesterday, I held you in my arms
And when I heard you say
You'd love me forever
It's funny but forever
Must have came today

Suddenly, I'm all alone
And the sun still shines above
The happy world I found
Came tumbling down
When I lost your love

Now I've got nothing
To cling to
But memories we've known
They're not very much company
They only bring misery
