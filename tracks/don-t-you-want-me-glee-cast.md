When you first left me, 
I was wanting more, 
You were kissing that girl next door 
What you do that for? (what you do that for?) 

When you first left me, 
I didnt know what to say, 
I never been on my own that way, 
Just sat by myself all day 

I was so lost back then, 
But with a little help from my friends, 
I found a light in the tunnel at the end 

Now you're calling me up on the phone, 
So you can have a little one in a moan, 
And its only 'cause you're feeling alone 

At first, when I see you cry, yeah it makes me smile, yeah makes me smile 
At worst, I feel bad for awhile, but then I just smile, I go ahead and smile 

Whenever you see me, 
You say that you want me back, 
But I tell you it dont mean jack, (dont mean jack) 
No it dont mean jack (it dont mean jack) 

I couldnt stop laughing, 
No I just couldnt help myself, 
That you messed up my mental health, 
I was quite unwell 

I was so lost back then, 
But with a little help from my friends, 
I found a light in the tunnel at the end 

Now you're calling me up on the phone, 
So you can have a little one in a moan, 
And its only 'cause you're feeling alone 

At first, 
When I see you cry, 
Yeah it makes me smile, 
Yeah makes me smile 
At worst, I feel bad for awhile, but then I just smile, 
I go ahead and smile 

Lalalalala

At first, 
When I see you cry, 
Yeah it makes me smile, 
Yeah makes me smile 
At worst, I feel bad for awhile, 
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile 

At first. 
When I see you cry, 
Yeah it makes me smile, 
Yeah makes me smile 
At worst, I feel bad for awhile, but then I just smile, I go ahead and smile
