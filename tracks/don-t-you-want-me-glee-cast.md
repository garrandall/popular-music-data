You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on, you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down, too
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe it when you say that you don't need me


It's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?


I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do


Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe it when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
(oh ohohoh oh oh)ohoh

Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby?
