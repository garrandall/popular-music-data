Well I was sitting waiting wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
The Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Aw maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time
So please ignore the next few lines
'Cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery.
Keep building it up,
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool, fool
