I'm just sitting here playing the guitar
(City High. Claudette. Wyclef)


Excuse me if you see me screaming
Deep in my mind I'm only dreaming
'Cause if I wake, girl, and you're not by my side
I'd feel like half of me is no longer alive
So, please, shorty, before you walk out that door, booby
Would you listen to my song


If only I give you one last chance
With the devil you can no longer dance
You got to be faithful, so we could be fruitful
Build a family and follow God's destiny
So just before I run to the block, papi
I might listen to your song


Oh, before you walk out that door, listen


They say two wrongs don't make it right
(don't make it right)
So if I'm wrong I ain't trying to fight
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight
Lay up in the bed and make love all night


So, papi, I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same


Girl I'ma love you like I never love
(touch me like you never touch me)
Yo if you give me the chance, girl
(yeah baby)
I'm gonna show you


Now baby understand
(I understand)
That I forgive you
And I ain't gonna forget
That you brought me pain
(baby, baby, baby, baby)


But I have grown
From a thug to a man
Build my castle with bricks
And no longer with sand
Oh, girl


And just before I run to the block, baby
I might listen to your song


Oh, before you walk out that door, listen


They say two wrongs don't make it right
(don't make it right)
So if I'm wrong I ain't trying to fight
(I don't wanna fight)
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight
Lay up in the bed and make love all night


So, papi, I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same


Girl, I'mma love you like I never love
(touch me like you never touch me)
Yo if you give me the chance girl
I'm gonna show you


I'm so used to the pain that I
Can't see the sunshine no more
I'm so used to the pain that the
The sickness feels like the cure


Ay, but if only you gave me
The keys to your soul
And let me in
I'm gonna love you
Over (over) and over (over) again


They say two wrongs don't make it right
(don't make it right)
So if I'm wrong I ain't trying to fight
(I don't wanna fight)
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight
Lay up in the bed and make love all night
(make love to me)


So, papi, I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay
But promise me that you'll do the same


Girl, I'ma love you like I never love
(touch me like you never touch me)
Yo if you give me the chance, girl
I'm gonna show you

(Show me, yeah)
I ain't gon' stay around the block no more
I'll come home early, girl, I promise
