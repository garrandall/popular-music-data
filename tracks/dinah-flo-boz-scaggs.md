Seems so long you've been gone
I've been singing such a sad sad song
I'm glad I found you
Glad my worlds around you

Dinah I've been lonely for you
Never knew how I cared for you
Glad you're back
Take you back in my arms

Dinah Flo love you so
Take me down way down slow
My Dinah Flo
Love you more each day

I'll be long I'll be true
But I can't say what Dinah might do
I'm glad she's back
Take her back in my arms 

Dinah Flo don't let go
Take me down girl nice and slow
Dinah Flo
Love you more each day

Oh my Dinah Flo come on lets go
Get that groove down way down slow
Dinah Flo 
Love you more each day

Oh my Dinah Flo don't let go
Take me down girl nice and slow
My Dinah Flo
Love you more each day hey hey

Dinah Flo love you so

Love you more ever so

Dinah Flo love you more each day
