Danger eyes are no surprise
In stayin' wise to you
Shady walks and midnight stalks
Have showed me what to do

Kept my cool, this ain't no fool
You think you're messin' with
I know how to keep you 'round
'Cause I know where you been

You think that they really want just you
(Better think again, better think again)
I'm the only one knows what to do
'Cause you've been bad, baby, oh, so bad, baby
And there's only one thing can be done

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine

Every time I think you're mine
You're up to somethin' new
I've done almost everythin'
To try to get to you

All my friends are just dead ends
In helpin' me alone
I just keep on wonderin'
What am I doin' wrong

There is only one thing left to try
(Do it again, do it again)
On this cure I'm sure I can rely
'Cause you've been bad, baby, oh, so bad
And there's only one thing can be done

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little bit touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Just a little touch up)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, my medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)

'Cause you've been bad, baby
Oh, you've been so bad
And there's only one thing can be done

Take your medicine
(Doctor's here)
Take your medicine
(The nurse is here)

Take your medicine
(Don't you wanna get cured')
Take your medicine
(Take your medicine, baby)

Take your medicine
(Take your medicine, honey)
Take your medicine
(Oh, come on)

Take your medicine
(Go on and take it)
Take your medicine
(Go on and take it)

You gotta take it if you wanna shake it
(Medicine)
You gotta take it if you wanna shake it
(Medicine)

You gotta take it if you wanna shake it
(Medicine)
You gotta take it if you wanna shake it

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Hey, I got all the medicine)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you a touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Come on, baby, take your medicine)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(I got the cure)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, take your medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure, you know I do, okay)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, my medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
