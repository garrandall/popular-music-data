Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
Hooray for Hazel, she's up to her tricks
Hooray for Hazel, she's gettin' her kicks

Hazel's been in love with many a guy
She tells them that she loves 'em and then says goodbye
Hooray for Hazel, I'm now on her list
I'm just another fool that couldn't resist

Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
Hooray for Hazel, she's up to her tricks
Hooray for Hazel, she's gettin' her kicks

Hazel never feels any pity or shame
A broken heart is just a part of her evil game
Hooray for Hazel, she did it again
I'll join the ranks of broken hearts that she put me in

Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
Hooray for Hazel, she's up to her tricks
Hooray for Hazel, she's gettin' her kicks

Hazel only does things she wants to do
She's selfish and spoiled and she knows that she's cute
Hooray for Hazel, she still gets her way
But there's a time a-comin' we'll be able to say

Hooray for Hazel, there's tears in her eyes
Hooray for Hazel, she know how to cry
Hooray for Hazel, she's meek as a dove
Hooray for Hazel, she's beggin' for love
Hooray for Hazel, there's tears in her eyes
Hooray for Hazel, she know how to cry
