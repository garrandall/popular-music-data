Youâve got the bullets
Iâve got the gun.
Iâve got a hankering for getting into something

I hit the bottle, you hit the gas,
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass.

Iâm feeling frisky, you're feeling good
I guess the whiskey is doing what it should
I got the cigarettes
Youâve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down weâll start a little fire

Ainât no use in trying to slow me down
âCause youâre running with the fastest girl in town

Ainât you baby?
I like âem crazy.

My reputation follows me around
Just makes me want to give them more to talk about
Letâs go to town for a little while
Iâll be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile

Ainât no use in trying to slow me down
âCause youâre running with the fastest girl in town

Ainât you baby?
Youâre kinda crazy.

Come on!

I see the blue lights, we better run.
Throw out the bottle and Iâll hide the gun
If he pulls us over Iâll turn on the charm
Youâll be in the slammer and Iâll be on his arm.

Ainât no use in trying to slow me down
âCause youâre running with the fastest girl in town

Ainât you baby?
Well I told you I was crazy.
No I ainât no bodyâs baby. 
Hey!

Heâs got the bullets 
Heâs got a gun
I got the hankering for getting into something.
