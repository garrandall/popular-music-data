You’ve got the bullets
I got the gun
I got a hankerin' for getting into somethin'
I hit the bottle, you hit the gas
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass


I’m feelin' frisky, you're feelin' good
I guess the whiskey is doin' what it should
I got the cigarettes
You’ve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down, we’ll start a little fire


Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
I like ‘em crazy


My reputation follows me around
Just makes me wanna give them more to talk about
Let’s go to town for a little while
I’ll be wearing nothin' but a tattoo and a smile


Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
You're kinda crazy


Come on!


I see the blue lights, we better run
Throw out the bottle and I’ll hide the gun
If he pulls us over, I’ll turn on the charm
You’ll be in the slammer and I’ll be on his arm


Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
Well, I told you I was crazy
No, I ain’t nobody’s baby
Hey!


He’s got the bullets, he’s got a gun
I got the hankerin' for gettin' into somethin'
