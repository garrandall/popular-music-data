Ho...oh...
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sitting here
Daydreaminâ about you
Oh, everything we had
Wish I could get it back

âCause if it ainât you, then I donât want it
And if it ainât you, then it ainât for me
I can see your face whenever I be sleepinâ
But it hurts when I realize Iâm dreaminâ

So if I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life (My life)
âCause you canât be replaced by nobody else
Iâll go crazy if I canât have you for myself (If I
canât have you)

If I canât have you (Iâll be)
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life 
Iâve decided that nobody could compare to you (Nobody)
Thereâs nobody that can make me feel the way you do
(Oh)

Thereâve been a few
Whoâve tried to take your place
Iâve been on many dates
Still it just ainât the same

if its not a letter sent from you, then I donât read it
If itâs not a gift sent from you, then I donât need it
Iâve been longinâ just to find somebody like you
But nobody can just do it quite like you, if I

So if I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life
âCause you canât be replaced by nobody else
Iâll go crazy if I canât have you for myself (Iâll go crazy)

If I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life
Iâve decided that nobody could compare to you 

Thereâs nobody that can make me feel the way you do

I took your pictures off the wall
That didnât seem to help at all
So Iâmma put it out there, Iâmma let you know
If you need to rest your head you can come back home

I thought that I could live without your love, you
know I tried
But I feel incomplete when I donât have you in my life
So Iâmma put it out there, Iâmma let you know (Let you
know)
If you need to rest your head you can come back home
(Come back home)

So if I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life
âCause you canât be replaced by nobody else
Iâll go crazy if I canât have you for myself

If I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life
Iâve decided that nobody could compare to you 
Thereâs nobody that can make me feel the way you do

So if I canât have you
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life
âCause you canât be replaced by nobody else (Nobody)
Iâll go crazy if I canât have you for myself (Oh, oh)

If I canât have you (If I canât have you)
Iâll just be single for the rest of my life (Iâll just
be single)
Iâve decided that nobody could compare to you 
Thereâs nobody that can make me feel the way you do

Nobody can make me feel like you do
Oh, no, nobody
Can make me feel the way you do
