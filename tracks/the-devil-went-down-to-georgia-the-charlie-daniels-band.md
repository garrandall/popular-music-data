The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump
And said "Boy, let me tell you what"

"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your
Soul 'cause I think I'm better than you"

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet you're gonna regret because I am the best that's ever has been

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded somethin' like this

When the Devil finished
Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done"

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back. If you ever wanna try again
I done told you onceâ€”you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been. He played

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
The chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no
