I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?


'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go


So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that


I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go


Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now


I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
