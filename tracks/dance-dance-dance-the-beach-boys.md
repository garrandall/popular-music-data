After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way


I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!


When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick


I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!
Oh my!


At a weekend dance we like to show up last
I play it cool when it's slow and jump it up when it's fast


I love to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!


Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot
Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot
Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!
Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot
Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot
Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot
