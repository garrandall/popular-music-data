As long as you love me
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me)
As long as you love me
(Love me, love me, love me, love me)
As long as you love me


We're under pressure (We're under pressure)
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in (Tryna fit in)
Keep it together (Keep it together)
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning (Frowning)
But hey now (Hey now), you know, girl (You know, girl)
We both know, it's a cruel world (Cruel world)
But I will (But I will) take my chances


As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me


I'll be your soldier (I'll be your soldier)
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
(For your dreams, girl)
I'll be your Hova (I'll be your Hova)
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress (Don't stress), and don't cry (And don't cry)
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly (Wings to fly)
Just take (Take), my hand


As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me


Whoa, whoa, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world (World) 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like whoa (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (Shoot)
Ask me, "What's my best side?"
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me


As long as you love me (Yeah, yeah, baby)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (Platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold


As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
(It's all I want, baby)
As long as you love me, you love me (Please don't go)
As long as you love me, as long as you love me
As long as you love me, yeah
As long as you love me (Love me, love me, love me, love me)
