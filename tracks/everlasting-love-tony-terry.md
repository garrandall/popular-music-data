Yeah hey

Itâs been a long day
Iâm gonna take it kind of easy and relax awhile
I wanna hear some mellow music nice and slow
You fill me up with love, you make me overflow

When I was down you would always lift me up
Thank God that you were there
I know that miracles and dreams come true
My every wish came true when I found you and your

Everlasting love
(Everlasting)
(The kind that wonât ever die, no, no, no, no, no, never)
Everlasting love
(Never, everlasting love)
Love
(Yeah hey, hey)

Temporary love donât mean a thing, no, no
(âCause if itâs temporary)
It canât be real, no

(And all the things youâve done for me)
Will never fade away
They last forever
You bring me joy
(You bring me joy)

And when I was down you would always lift me up
Thank God that you were there
I know that miracles and dreams come true
My every wish came true when I found you and your

Everlasting love
(Everlasting)
(The kind that wonât ever die, no, no, no, no, no, never)
Everlasting love
(Never, the kind of love that lasts forever and ever)
Love
(And ever)

Things I used to do, I donât do no more
Places I used to go, I donât go no more
Ever since you came along, you gave my heart a brand new song
And, ooh, a sweet love song and I wanna thank you for

Everlasting love
(Everlasting love)
(My love, my love will last forever and ever)
Everlasting love
(Everlasting love)
Love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, seek and yeâ shall find
Everlasting peace of mine
The kind of love that wonât ever die
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you knock on the door, it shall be yours
(The kind of love that lasts forever and ever and ever)

(I wanna thank you, Heavenly Father)
Everlasting love
(For shining Your light on me)
(The kind that wonât ever die)
(For givinâ me your everlasting love, love, yeah)
Everlasting love
(I know your love will last forever and ever)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everlasting love
(The kind of love that wonât ever die)
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everlasting love
(No, no, no, no, no, never, never)
