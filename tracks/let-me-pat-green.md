Let Me
Pat Green

Keep your head there on my shoulder
Let's just lay here for awhile
We can hurry when we're older
And girl, don't worry about tomorrow
That just seems so far away
Love for me, me and you
All that we have to do is follow
Just follow

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Oh, and baby then
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
I want to be that man
If you let me
C'mon, baby, let me

Baby, leave those candles burning
Slide on over here to me
If you run with me, girl
You know we'll make this world stop turning
Just stop turning

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Oh, and baby then
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
Well, I can be that man
If you let me
Oh, whoa

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been
Yeah, and let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end
I want to be that man
If you'd let me
