I think about her all the time
She's my fantasy
An image burnin' in my mind
Callin' out to me

While my imagination's runnin' wild
Yeah - things are getting clearer

Oh, this time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine

I've thought of every word I'd say
Give or take a few
But she turns and slowly walks away
What do I have to do

Hey - turn up your radio
Oh - there's somethin' I want you to know

Yeah, this time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
This time

It's hard to take cause she's miles away
And I've waited a long time
But the feelin's right and darlin' one of these nights
Yeah - I'm gonna let you know

Oh, this time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine

This time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, this time
