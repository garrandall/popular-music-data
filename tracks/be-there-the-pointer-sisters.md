If you stick with me, baby
I won't do you wrong
And we're gonna have some fun
We're so good together in this crazy world
Where you can't count on anyone

I'd climb any mountain
Just to get you free
I would swim the ocean
Can you do the same for me?

Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there
Be there

Ooh
You know that you can lie to me, baby
I will understand
As long as in the end you tell the truth
Cause it's give and it's take
It's no piece of cake and I know it works with you

You don't need no doctor
You don't need no pills
You don't need some cozy friends
Running up your bills

Hey
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

Bah boom
Bah boom
Bah boom, bah
Bah boom
Bah boom
Bah boom, bah

Hey, hey
Drive my continental
Jam it to the floor
Wear my best clothes out at night
And I'll just give you more

Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
