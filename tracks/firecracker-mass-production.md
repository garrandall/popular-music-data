So, so, so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa


Her name is Ophelia
And she is my fly
I call her firecracker
And that's no lie
A real poppin' lady, yeah
So soft and so pretty
And when I get around her, yeah
I can't wait to be dirty, oh, mamacita


Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker
So, so, so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I saw her in motion, yeah
And a smile that's so fine
(So fine, so fine, so fine)
Instant love potion, yeah
Just flows through my mind
(My mind, my mind, my mind)
I love to see her boogie, yeah, yeah
She two steps so fine
She's such a lovely lady, lady, lady
I'm so glad she's mine, oh, mamacita


Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Fire




Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
So, so, so good
So, so, so good
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Woo
Get enough, get enough
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Fire


So, so, so good
So, so, so good, yeah
So, so, so good
So, so, so good, yeah, yeah, yeah
Firecracker come dance for me
I just like to see the way you move
Firecracker come dance for me
I just like to see the way you move
Firecracker come dance for me
I just like to see the way you move
Firecracker come dance for me
I just like to see the way you move, yeah
