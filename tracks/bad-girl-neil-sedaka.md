I don't believe a word they're saying
What they're saying isn't true

Everybody calls her bad girl (Bad bad girl)
Everybody put her down (Bad bad girl)
Why don't they take the time to understand
She's looking for a love she's never found

And it's only cos she's lonely (Bad bad girl)
That's the way she got her name (Bad bad girl)
All she did was look for someone to love
And they put the girl to shame

(Hey there she's not the girl for you)
Well you don't know her like I do
(Hey there listen to your friends)
If you're gonna put her down, here's where our friendship ends

I don't hear a word you're saying (Bad bad girl)
She's the one I'm dreaming of (Bad bad girl)
So don't you ever call her bad girl again
Cos she's found someone to love

(Hey there open up your eyes)
All I see is just a pack of lies
(Hey there she's gonna break your heart)
I'm gonna listen to the rumours that you start

I don't hear a word you're saying (Bad bad girl)
She's the one I'm dreaming of (Bad bad girl)
So don't you ever call her bad girl again
Cos she's found someone to love
