You just don't know what you do to me (This shit knocks huh?)
Bad Boy (Uh...Uh!)


Give me all the chicken heads from Pasadena to Medina
Bet Big get in between ya then see ya
Peep the prognosis, doses
Blends and Bends like Twizzlers
Big is fitting to hurt
What's under that skirt?
(Slow down, nigga, you're killin' em)
Who fillin' 'em with octane?
Got 'em gassed up
'Bout to get blast up, some
The last one, word to mother
Brother miss â€™em
I seen it when he kissed 'em at the wake
Made his body shake (Woooooo!)
The high guy in 850i, smoke tint
Rap terror, four chrome Antera's (I like that!)
Two Fives by the livers, the fifth's inconspicuous
Bad Boy slipped in ninety-five? Ridiculous!
My rap lines is like land mines
One step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room
To whom it may concern, Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s the click
Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your shit


In the middle of the day now baby
I seem to think of only you, hey, oh yeah
Never thinking for a moment baby
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah, so

I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby
And there's nothing left to say


Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Every time I see you
I get this feeling, oh yeah
Telling me you are the one
Oh what a feeling, hey

(Let's go)

I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby
And there's nothing left for me to say

Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Take me away, so far away
Oh what you do to me, oh
I wanna be alone together
Somewhere just you and me
Oh, oh

Oh, baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Oh, baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Oh, baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Oh, baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
