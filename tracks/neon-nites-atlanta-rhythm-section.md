We were two crazy people
It was a neon night
A little glitter
Multi-colored slides

There was some high stepping
Oh, what a life
With those high rolling
Star snuggling neon nites

Guess we had us
A high time or two
I remember those
Neon nites with you

Give me some high trotting
Sure got it on
Those oogie boogie
Honky tonky songs

You wore your silver stockings
We danced till dawn
Hootchie cootchie

Hard rocking all night long

Now the dance of bright lights
Make me blue
I miss those neon nites
With you

We were two crazy people
It was a neon night
A little glitter
Multi-colored slides

Nowadays the bright
Lights make me blue
Yes, they do
And I miss those
Neon nites with you

I miss those neon nites
With you
