The next woman I get
She gotta have job
I'm not tryin' to be no pimp
I just don't intend to work to hard
I won't have to buy the groceries
She gotta pay the rent
She gotta fill up my car every day
And give me account of every dime she spend

I made up my mind
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

She gotta make me think she loves me
By staying in her place
And sleep in another room
So she won't be snorin' in my face
And when I ask her for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you have no frown

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
Yes I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

Now when I ask for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you be no clown
Now that might sound cold to ya baby
You might think I'm unfair
But I've been hurt so many times
Till I, I really don't care

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me
