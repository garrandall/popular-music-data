Kathy, Kathy I love you
More than I can say;
But I feel that we are drifting apart
More and more each day.

Sweet little Kathy,
Sweet little Kathy,
Sweet little Kathy I need your love so badly.

I don't know the next verse

Last verse:

Kathy, Kathy now you're gone
I'm lonely every day,
Won't you make me happy once again,
Please come back and stay.
