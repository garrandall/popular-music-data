How can you look me straight in the eye
And say I should try to forget you
Didn't my love mean anything to you
Did all my kisses go through you

Ashes to ashes
Our love is a dream that's burning
Memories in smoke are starting to rise
I can't keep the tears from my eyes

How can you tell me it's over and done
Wasn't it fun while it lasted
How can you tell me you want to retreat
And no longer need me beside you

Ashes to ashes
Our love is a dream that's burning
Memories in smoke are starting to rise
I can't keep the tears from my eyes

Ashes to ashes
Our love is a dream that's burning
Memories in smoke are starting to rise
I can't keep the tears from my eyes

Ashes to ashes
Our love is a dream that's burning
Memories in smoke are starting to rise
I can't keep the tears from my eyes
