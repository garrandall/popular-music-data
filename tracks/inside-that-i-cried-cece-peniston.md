The talks we had on stormy nights
I often rushed away
When you were not in common sight
I was held by your embrace
I gaze and see the pain you feel
To think we had to part
I didn't feel you loved me
So I played games with your heart


It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye
It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried


You treated me just like a queen
For me that wasn't enough
You showered me with expensive things
But I found a new love
Mistakes I made were fatal ones
Finally I see you cared
I can't undo what has been done
Now I need you and you're not there


It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye
It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried


No more prayers to make for tomorrow
Our time has slipped away
I feel so helpless
There's nothing I can do or say
To make things better


It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye
It was inside that I cried for you
Now you're never coming back for me no more
Oh baby I know that I was wrong
So you left me all alone
Don't go
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried
