Listen people to what I say
I say everybody's got to have their day

And don't you know that
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
Everybody's got to win a heart
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
When you do, I hope you never part

I once found love, found love just like you
But then he came, he might come to you

And don't you know that
Everybody's got to lose somebody sometime
But everybody can part
Everybody's got to lose somebody sometime
So take care that you don't lose your heart

Take my advice and you'll always find
You'll be happy all of the time
Take my advice and you will see
You'll be happy as you can be

Listen people to what I say
I say everybody's got to have their day

And don't you know that
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
Everybody's got to win a heart
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
When you do, I hope you never part
You never part
Listen people
Listen people
