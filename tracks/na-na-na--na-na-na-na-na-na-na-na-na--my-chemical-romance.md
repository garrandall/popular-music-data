Look alive, sunshine
One-oh-nine in the sky
But the pigs won't quit
You're here with me: Doctor Death-Defy
I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter
Pumpin' out the slaughter-matic sounds
To keep you live
A system failure for the masses
Anti-matter for the master-plan
Louder than God's revolver
And twice as shiny
This one's for all you rock and rollers
All you crash queens and motor babies
Listen up!


The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys
Make some noise

(na, na, na...)

Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill them all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator

Love, gimme love, gimme love
I don't need it, but I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an X on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me

(na, na, na...)

From mall security
To every enemy
We're on your property
Standing in V formation

(na, na, na...)

Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation

(More! Gimme more! Gimme more!)

Oh, let me tell you 'bout the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can
Kiss me you animal

(na, na, na...)

You run the company
Fuck like a Kennedy
I think we'd rather be
Burning your information

(na, na, na...)

Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation

And right here
Right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children
Raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvee halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon
And fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try, now
I'll be your detonator

(na, na, na...)

Make no apology
It's death or victory
On my authority
Crash and burn
Young and loaded

Drop like a bullet shell
Dress like a sleeper cell
I'd rather go to hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me
Pull this pin
Let this world explode


Keep running!
