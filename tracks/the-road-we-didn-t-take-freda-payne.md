I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending
And find the road we didn't take
The life we didn't make
But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me
Of the road we didn't take
The years we threw away


Nameless faces come like haunting dreams
Words we spoke but didn't mean
I watch my life as it unwinds
I see the years I left behind
Tears go rushing down my face
For the years I threw away
Far away


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending
And find the road we didn't take
The life we didn't make
But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me
Of the road we didn't take
The years we threw away


In my hands, I hold the burnt-out ends
Pages of the past where we began
The love I thought would always stand
I found was built on shifting sand
The road to life went a different way
The road we should've took yesterday
So far away


(I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending
But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me
Oh, oh
Ohoh-oh-oh)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending
And find the road we didn't take
The life we didn't make
But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me
Of the road we didn't take
The years we threw away
