The general is a man
Whose true love ran away
The colonel found his sweetheart
In another's arms

The captain also learned
That love just doesn't pay
And now that I have lost your charms

I think I'll join the brigade
The brigade of broken hearts
Where instead of reveille
They play the blues

We never won a war
In the battle of l'amour
The brigade of broken hearts

You said you'd always love me
And that I would be the only one
Whose arms would ever hold you near

But then last night
Your lips and arms deserted me
Here comes another volunteer

To sign up for the brigade
The brigade of broken hearts
Where instead of reveille
They play the blues

We never won a war
In the battle of l'amour
The brigade of broken hearts

Instead of rifles
They all carry handkerchiefs
So they can wipe away
Each sad and lonely tear

I better get another
Dozen handkerchiefs
I'm the biggest loser of the year

I'm gonna join the brigade
The brigade of broken hearts
Where instead of reveille
They play the blues

We never won a war
In the battle of l'amour
The brigade of broken hearts
