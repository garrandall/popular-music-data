I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me


If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!


I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me


How can we follow?
How can we follow?
