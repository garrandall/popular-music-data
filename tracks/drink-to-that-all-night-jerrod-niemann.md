Pullin' up now, and the parking lot's full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull
Everybody in the ATL is coming
DJs got those speakers thumping
Got a black ford not a white Mercedes
Walking in the front door checking out the ladies
My buddy says hey boys I'm buying
The hottest girl in here's giving me the eye and.

Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talking gone gone gone
Turning all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

Working on the sweet thing sitting on a bar stool
Doing shots of Jack girl gonna take it old school
Singing hell yeah to every song they're playing
Do ya wanna dance? Baby I'm just saying

Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talking gone gone gone
Turning all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

Yeah, I can drink to that all night

Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough

Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talking gone gone gone
Turning all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

I can drink to that all night
I can drink to that all night

Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
