Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feeding, darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone but no one's leaving, nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feeling but we never feel it, riding on our last train home
Dying in our sleep, we're living out a dream, we only make it out alone

I just keep on hoping that you call me
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losing something that we never found
We're running out of reasons but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home

Outside the winter sky turning grey
City up in smoke it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the morning, blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all the eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now, they closing in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo
Wish I could go, I'm losing hope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

I just keep on hoping that you call me
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losing something that we never found
We're running out of reasons but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home
