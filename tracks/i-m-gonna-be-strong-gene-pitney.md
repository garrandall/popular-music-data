I can see you're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong and let you go your way

Our love is gone there's no sense in holding on
Cos your pity now would be to much to bear
So I'm gonna be strong and pretend I don't care
I'm gonna be strong and stand as tall as I am
Yes I'm gonna be strong and let you run along
And take it like a man

When you say it's the end I'll just hand you a line
I'll smile and say don't you worry I'm fine
And you'll never know
Darling after you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry
