I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas please
Fold 'em let 'em hit me raise it
Baby stay with me
Love the game intuition play the cards
With spades to start
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one that's on his heart


I'll get him hot
And show him what I've got


Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody

P-p-p-poker face 

I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun
When you're with me
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love
If it ain't rough it isn't fun

I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got


Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody

I won't tell you
That I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin'
With my muffin
I'm not lying
I'm just stunnin'
With my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

I'm marvelous 
So marvelous

She's got to love nobody
Can't read my can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
