It's the same old story all over again
You turn a lover into just another friend
I wanna love you
I wanna make you mine
Won't you lay it on the line


I'm tired of playin foolish games
I'm tired of all your lies makin me insane
I don't ask for much the truth will do just fine
Won't you lay it on the line

Chorus:
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Don't waste my time


You got no right to make me wait
We better talk girl before it gets too late
I never ever thought you could be so unkind
Won't you lay it on the line

Chorus

You know I love you, you know it's true
It's up to you, girl,now what've I got to do
Don't hold me up, girl, don't waste my precious time
Won't you lay it on the line

Chorus
