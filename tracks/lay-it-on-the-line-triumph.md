It's the same old story all over again 
You turn a lover into just another friend 
I want to love you, 
I want to make you mine 
Won't you lay it on the line? 
I'm tired of playing all your foolish games 
I'm tired of all of your lies making me insane 
I donât ask for much
True would do just fine
Won't you lay it on the line 


Lay it on the line 
Lay it on the line 
Lay it on the line
Don't waste my time 

You got no right to make me wait 
We better talk, girl, before it gets too late 
I never ever thought you could be so unkind 
Won't you lay it on the line? 

 

You know I love you, you know it's true 
It's up to you, girl, what've I got to do 
Don't hold me up, girl, don't waste my precious time 
Won't you lay it on the line?
