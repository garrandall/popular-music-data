I'm gonna do all the things for you, a girl wants a man to do.
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
I'll sacrifice for you, I'll even do wrong for you.
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)

Every minute, every hour.
I'm gonna shower you with love and affection.
Look out it's coming in your direction.
And I'm... I'm gonna make you love me.
Oh, yes I will.
Yes I will.
I'm gonna make you love me.
Oh, yes I will.
Yes I will.


Look it here.
My love is strong, you see.
I know you'll never get tired of me.
Oh, baby (Sho' won't) (Oh baby)
And I'm gonna use every trick in the book.
I'll try my best to get you hooked.
Hey, baby (Take me I'm yours) (Hey, baby)

And every night, every day.
I'm gonna say.
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you.
Look out boy, 'cause I'm gonna get you.

I'm gonna make you love me.
Ooo, yes I will.
Yes I will.
And I'm gonna make you love me.
Ooo, yes I will
You know I will.

Every breathe I take.
And each and every step I make.
Brings me closer, baby.
Closer to you.


And with each beat of my heart.
For every day we are apart.
I'll hunger for every wasted hour.


And every night and every day.
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you.
Look out 'cause I'm gonna get you.

And I'm gonna make...
I'm gonna make you love me.
Oh, oh. (Yes I will)
I'm gonna make you love me.
Ooo, yes I will. Yes I will.
I'm gonna make you love me.
Yes I will. (Yes I will)
Ooo, I'm gonna make you love me.
Yes I will.
Yes I will.
