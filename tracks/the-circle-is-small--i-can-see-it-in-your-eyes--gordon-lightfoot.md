It's alright for some
But not alright for me
When the one that I'm loving
Slips around


You think it's fine to do
Things I cannot see
And you're doing it to me
Baby can't you see
That I know how it is


I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes


It's alright for some
But not alright to be
Where the one that I'm loving
Can't be found
The city where we live
Might be quite large
But the circle is small
Why not tell us all
And then all of us will know


I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes


It's alright to leave
But not alright to lie
When you come home and you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do
Things I cannot see
And you're doing it to me
Baby, can't you see
That I know how it is


I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes
