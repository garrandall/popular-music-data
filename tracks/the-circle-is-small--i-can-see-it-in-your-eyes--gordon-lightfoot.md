It's alright for some, but not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me
Baby, can't you see that I know how it is

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking just like this
I can see the way you look when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
The city where we live may be quite large
But the circle is small
Why not tell us all, and then all of us will know

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking just like this
I can see the way you look when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright to feel, but not alright to lie
When you come back and you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' them to me
Baby, can't you see, that I know how it is

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking just like this
I can see the way you look when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright with me
With me
