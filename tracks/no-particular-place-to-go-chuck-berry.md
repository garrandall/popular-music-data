Ridin' along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Crusin' n' playin' the radio-o-o
With no particular place to go

Ridin' along in a Mini Metro
She said to me she loves me so, loves me so, loves me so
She smiled at me and looked so sweet
I thought I was in for a treat, in for a treat, in for a treat
My happy face began to glow-ow-ow
With no particular, no particular, no particular place to go


There's no particular place to go, there's no particular place to go
There's no particular, no particular, no particular place to go
To go there's no particular place to go, there's no particular place
Particular place, particular place, particular ticular place

Temperature's risin' really quick, really quick, really quick
Then she says she gets car sick, car sick oh no!
She said her love for me was true, truly true, truly true
She jumped in the back and began to spew,
Ridin' along and feeling low-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
With no particular place to go
