Turn the lights on!

Oh wo-oh, oh wo-oh

We share something so common
Still so rare, and I'm in awe
Never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls
Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so...

...In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Turn the lights on!

Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way...

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack( oh and it's killing me)
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Turn the lights on!

Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts,
'Cause I wanna leave, and you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together

And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way...

...In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
If I knew I'd feel like this man
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

If I knew I'd feel like this man
Oh wo-oh, never never never knew love (oh wo-oh) would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
