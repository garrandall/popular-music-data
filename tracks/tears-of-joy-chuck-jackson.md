Hey, Chuck, why you crying
Well, I'll tell you 'bout it

When you see me crying
Don't worry about me, boy
When you see me crying
Don't worry about me, boy
'Cause these tears I'm crying
They are tears of joy

(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy)

Don't worry about me, boy
'Cause these are tears of joy
(Tears of joy)

My baby just told me
Everything was all right
And then she kissed me
So sweetly last night

Ha, so you don't have
To worry about me, boy
'Cause these are tears of joy
All right

(Tears of joy, tears of joy)
(Tears of joy, tears of joy)
(Tears of joy)

Don't worry about me, boy
'Cause these are tears of joy
(Tears of joy)

My baby, she kissed me
(Tears of joy)
So sweetly last night
(Tears of joy)

She said, Chuck, everything
(Tears of joy)
Is gonna be all right
(Tears of joy)

So that's why I'm crying, fellas
'Cause these are tears of joy

(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy) tears of joy
(Tears of joy) I can't help but cry
'Cause my baby said (tears of joy)
Everything is all right...
