What the fuck is we doin'
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gang, back in the stu' (Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
Uh, yeah, gang back in the stu' (Gang)
Young nigga win, win, win, win (Bitch), how can I lose? (Ha, bitch)
Uh, how can I lose? (Ha, bitch), uh, how can I lose? (Yeah)
I ain't with the gang, gang, gang, gang (Bitch), finna gon' shoot (Squa)
Me and Trav' in the coupe (Scoo'), paparazzi research the route (Yeah, uh)
Uh, yeah, see your bitch gettin' loose, huh
I'm in LA with the views, huh (Yeah), I'm in LA with your boo (Yeah)


It's lit
We on the quest with the tribe (I bought it)
It's way too late pickin' sides (Go, yeah)
Jack make them boys come alive (Then what?)
Better not fuck up the vibe (It's Travis)
Runnin' this shit with a stride
(You know my gang with the flies)


I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, boys hoppin' out of coupes, gang
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue
I see you holdin' all of my chains, I need 'em all on the loose (Ching, ching)
When I ride it off of my side, best believe I got the scoop, scoop
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice (Yeah), see the stain like the flu (Yeah)
Whole squad goin' up, up, Jack Boys on the loose (Yeah, yeah, bitch)


In the H, rippin' Screw (Screw)
Flamin' Harlem with the goons {It's lit, yeah}
We was wylin', skippin' school (Wylin')
Now we kick 'em, make the- (Ching, ching)
Now we kick 'em, make the millions
Tryna down my crew {I'm tilt}
Cactus Jack on my shoe, it is li
I came from the mud straight to the top (Yeah)
Shooters outside double parked
I'm from New York, she like how I talk
She need a ass, it's bought
Kid in my chambers, we went wild
Sure, that bitch, crazy, gave more mouth
Sorry young Jacques, nose goin' down
Smokin' that Jack, get it by the pound {Straight up}
Don't need the pussy, I'm in and I'm out (I'm out)
Sittin' here smokin' that loud
Hit my hoes when I'm in town (Yeah)
They know who got the scouts (Zoom)


I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, boys hoppin' out of coupes (Gang)
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue (Bitch)
I see you holdin' all of my chains (Yeah), I need 'em all on the loose (Yeah, yeah, ching, ching)
When I ride it off of my side, best believe I got the scoop, the scoop
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops (Ooh)
Whole squad got the juice, see the stain like the flu (Ooh, ah)
Whole squad goin' up (Ooh), Jack Boys on the loose (Yeah)


Yeah
I'm from the North where they robbin' and killin' (Woo, woo)
Young nigga rich but I'm still from the trenches (Woo)
Luxury Tax, my water by G
P-I-R-U, bitch, I bang what I bleed (Ooh)
I'm passin' up pills, I'ma geek at the 'Ville (Yeah)
One shot to the head and make sure it don't miss (Ooh)
I fuck on the bitch I been stalkin' on 5th (Yeah)
Start pourin' it back, they say it don't exist, at all
Fifth got some rounds {at the crib}
Like, {"I wanna fuck right not"
Keep hunnids on hunnids for real
Bitch, I'm goin' up right now}
Bitch, roll up some weed, you know gang in the stu'
Bottles on bottles, 1942
Models on models, this shit nothin' new
You might catch some shots takin' shots at the crew
I like my hoes by the two
Blew eight hundred K on a coupe (Uh-huh, racks)
We fucked, there wasn't none else to do (Ooh)
You play with La Flame, I'ma shoot, racks
This a hundred round drum, I got mob ties
This a double M truck, ain't no broke vibes
Now we only take jets for the hard times
Know I call up them killers, they gon' slide
Bitch, I'm with the gang


I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, boys hoppin' out of coupes {Gang}
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue (Bitch)
I see you holdin' all of my chains, I need 'em all on the loose (Ching, ching)
When I ride it off of my side, best believe I got the scoop, northside
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops, take that to the troops
Whole squad got the juice (Ooh), see the stain like the flu, ooh
Whole squad goin' up (Up), Jack Boys on the loose (Yeah)
