Fragrance of that long lost evening
Tender moves that keep repeating
Soft night's melody that I can't forget
Younger boy and helpless girl
Passion of the other world
Strange old place from a 
Nursery rhyme that I can't forget
I can't go back, but I can't stay 
Help me
Remember the nights with you 

Street corner stands in shade
Lanterns swing in the heat of day
Old lady sings the song that I can't forget
Little girl that asked you who
Collects the flowers they give to you
Her eyes, her dress, the sky 

The blue that you can't forget
I can't go back, but I can't stay 
Help me
Remember the nights with you


Long ago and far away 
Memory like a dream 
I stay in the other place
The other time that I can't forget
I can't go back, but I can't stay 
Help me
Remember the nights
Remember the nights
Remember the nights with you
