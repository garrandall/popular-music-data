When the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round
Whoa, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used to be
Whoa, the night life ain't no good life
Oh, but it's my life

Well, listen to the blues
That they're playing
Yeah, listen to what
The blues are saying

Life is just a another scene
From this old world of broken dreams
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Whoa, the night life ain't no good life
Yeah, but it's my life
