I'm just a young girl
Dying to learn the ways of love
Just to please you
You're the only someone I love
Come on and teach me


There are so many things
That I, I just don't know
But I, I love you, love you, love you so
So the things I don't know
Show me how


I don't wanna lose
Someone sweet just like you
For you make me feel like a queen
I wanna make you feel like a king
Show me how


You know I want you
How bad I need you
I wanna kiss you right now
If I don't move you
Wanna try to soothe you
And darling please, show me how


There are so many things
That I, I just don't know, oh
But I, I love you, love you, love you so
So the things I don't know
Show me how


Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
(I'm ready to learn)
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
(Come on, baby, teach me right now)
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
(I wanna please you, baby)
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
