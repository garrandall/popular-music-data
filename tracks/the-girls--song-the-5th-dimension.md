I'd like, to make, a long distance call
To a number West L.A.
I've been trying to reach it all day
But no one answers

Tell me why
Was I so unkind
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him

If he hasn't changed his number
(If he hasn't changed his number)
If he hasn't changed his mind

I know, it's late
But please let it ring
Another time or two
Or three

He'd be hurt if he knew it was me
And I was waiting for him

Why was I so unkind
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him

If he hasn't changed his number
(If he hasn't changed his number)
If he hasn't changed his mind

Lonely person to lonely person

Oh tell me why was I so unkind
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him

If he hasn't changed his number
(If he hasn't changed his number)
If he hasn't changed his mind
