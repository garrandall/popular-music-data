(I want to love you
For what you are)

Put your games away
I don't wanna play
Take the pain from your face
And come my way

Put your trust in me
And you'll see we'll go far
I want to love you
I want to love you
For what you are

You don't need to lie
To get throught to me
If you open your eyes
I'm sure you'll see

I'm in love with you
And not a movie star
I want to love you
I want to love you
For what you are

It's not fake lashes
Or loud sunglasses
That make you attractive to me

But underneath your getup
Oh, girl, behind your setup
I see the woman that you could be

So, girl, don't you have
All that love inside
Let me know, love me real
I won't hurt your pride

All you have to do
Is be what you are
Lovers must be true
If their love is to go far

So give yourself to me
And, girl, you're gonna see
I want to love you
I want to love you
For what you are

I want to love you
For what you are, wooo
I want to love you, baby
For what you are, wooo
