I'm ready, I'm ready now
I want you now

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

Patience isn't my best virtue
When I'm in the mood for love
I can't control my passion
I wanna love you all over

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

My nature is high inside I'm burning
About to lose self control
I can't fight this feeling
My love is much to hot to hold

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

If it was really meant to be
Don't push it
It will happen naturally
Don't force it

What will be will surely be
Don't push it
If love was meant for you and me
Don't force it

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

You're the spark that lights my fire
You set me off to a full alarm
I can't stand anticipation
I'm in the mood to get it on

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If love was meant to be

Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen
If it was meant to be
