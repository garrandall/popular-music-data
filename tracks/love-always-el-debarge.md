I got a secret for you
Can't believe myself
But ever since you've been gone
I think of no one else
I've even tried to forget
But nothing can make me

I know that it's so hard to be true
Under the summer skies
I'll write your name in my Book
At least a thousand times
And every day you're away
It's drivin' me crazy

So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name "Love always"
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
Darlin', if we both can wait
We'll have a time to celebrate
For the rest of our lives, love always

And lots of people I know
Try to shape your mind
But that can't happen to me
I'm not the jealous kind
No one can change what I feel
And nothing can make me

Still I'll write to you every night
And I'll sign my name, "Love always"
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
Darlin', if we both can wait, oh
We'll have the time to celebrate
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the best of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives

We'll always be
So faithfully
Just hang on to me forever

So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name, "Love always"
Oh, and if by now you haven't guessed
I will add one more P.S.
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the best of our lives, love always

I'll sign this letter to you "Love always"
Oh, know it
Oh... oh... oh... I Love you baby
Oh, and if I do over and over again
Sign my name over in full
And at the end and rest of our lives, love always
Love always
Oh girl
Sounds so good to me, mmm
For the rest of our lives love always, oh
For the rest of our lives love always, oh da da
Oh, I, I gotta secret for you
I don't wanna stop, sounds so good to me
Oh, ever and a day
I'll always love you
Ever and a day
Oh
