Hey, lumpa sugar, you look kinda sweet
Cuter than a baby walkin' down the street
When I look into your eyes, I wanna leap
I can't conceal that you make me feel

Like a tiger
Ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!

I'm feelin' stronger than a grizzly bear
Soarin' like an eagle flyin' through the air
When I get you in my arms, you'd better beware
I go insane 'cause I can't be tamed

Like a tiger
Ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!

You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, every time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you

I'm your tiger and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

Like a tiger
Ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!

You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, ev'ry time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you

I'm your tiger and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

Like a tiger
Ooh, like a tiger
Ooh, just to see you smile nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!
