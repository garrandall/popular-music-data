So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
All the way
All the way down to Emmaline

But if our paths never cross
Well you know I'm sorry but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

But if our paths never cross
Well you know I'm sorry but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

If I hope and if I pray
Oh it might work out someday

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
