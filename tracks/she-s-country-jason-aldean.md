You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl


She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all


Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country


A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all


Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country


(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country


She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone
She's country
