I had a dream
Thinking that you were gone
Leaving me on my own

And you, you was there
In some other's arms
Giving away all my charms

And when I awake
I want to hear you
Filling my life with cheer

And when I come back
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be at home

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
With you at home with me

I'm so?
It was only a dream

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you've been gone

I can be so good to you
Help me, help me sing

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone
I'm glad it's only a dream

Let me say one thing
Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you've been gone

Come on back home
Sometimes I dream
About you, baby

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone....
