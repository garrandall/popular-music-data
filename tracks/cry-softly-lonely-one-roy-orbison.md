Cry softly lonely one 
It's over, it's said, it's done 
Don't let your heart break down 
He's not the only one 
So you're blue, and lonely too 
Don't fall apart 
And when the teardrops start 
You can cry, cry to me girl 
Cry, cry to me girl 
I'll be standing by 
I will dry your eyes 
But for now, cry softly lonely one 

Cry softly lonely one 
Your heartaches have just begun 
And though they linger on 
Carry on, be strong 

You're baby's gone, left you alone 
But I'll stand by you 
On the long nights through 
You can cry, cry to me girl 
C'mon and cry, cry to me girl 

From this moment on 
Don't cry all alone 
You can run to me, come to me 
You can cry to me 
Tonight and forever, lonely one
