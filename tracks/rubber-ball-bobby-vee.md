Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Hoo-ah-ohooh

I'm like a - rubber ball, baby that's all
That I am to you (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
Just a rubber ball 'cause you think you
Can be true to two (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
You bounce my heart around (you don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you

If you - stretch my love till it's thin enough to tear
I'll just stretch my arms to reach you anywhere
And like a
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you

You bounce my heart around (you don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Hoo-ah-ohooh
Bouncy, bouncy... bouncy, bouncy
Bouncy, bouncy... bouncy, bouncy
Eee-ah-ee-ee

You bounce my heart around (you don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Ah-ohoohhohoh
(Bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
(Bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)

I'm like a rubber band
When on my shoulder you do tap
(Bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
Just a rubber band
Because my heartstrings, they just snap
(Bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
You go and squeeze me till I'm all aflame
(She calls you by some other guy's name)
But like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
