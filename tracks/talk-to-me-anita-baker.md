Oh
Baby, baby, baby

You stand all alone on your own
Please come inside from that storm
Stand where it's warm
I can see you're in need
Baby, please talk to me now

Swear nothing is wrong
You're so strong
Baby, don't hold this inside
Relax your pride

Let it go
Set it free
My baby, talk to me now

What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through, darling?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(I can help you if you let me, baby, yes, I can...)

I understand
Here's my hand
Why stand alone in the dark?
Open up your heart

Let this go
Set it free now
My baby, talk to me now

What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through, darling?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(I can help you if you let me, baby, yes, I can)

I understand
(I understand you, baby)
That you're only one man
So much you can't take, baby
(I understand you, baby)
Yes, I understand that you've only got two hands

Stare into space
I see shadows of pain across your face
You avoid my advice
You avoid my embrace, baby

What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(I won't tell a single soul, my, my, my baby, yeah)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(Yeah)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(You got to, I got to, we got to talk about it)
What's wrong, wrong with you?
(No doubt about it, let it go)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Set it free, baby)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(I'd like to listen, I'd like to listen, baby)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Tell me, tell me everything, baby, baby)
What's wrong, wrong with you?
(I will understand)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(I will understand, I promise, baby)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(Tell me now... tell me...)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Tell me, oh)
What's wrong, wrong with you?
(I believe)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Hey, hey, baby!)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(Talk about it, baby, talk to me!)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Don't you hold nothing in, baby)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(Don't you hold it, baby! Ain't no reason)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Ain't no reason in the world for you to do this, baby)

What's wrong, wrong with you?
(Not like this, ain't no reason)
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
(Ain't no reason, reason in the world)
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
