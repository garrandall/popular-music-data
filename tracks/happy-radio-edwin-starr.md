An automatic alarm
Turns my radio on
Before my feet can hit the floor
The music's got me ready to go
And all through the whole day
I know my favorite records they'll play
It helps me chase all my blues away
When I can hear that DJ say that
This is station
H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan to help your day go by
I said it's a Musical, natural high
On station H.A. H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan to help your day go by
I said it's a Musical, natural high
Station H.A. H.A.P.P.Y.

You should hear them
Everyday yeah

While riding home in my car
My happy radio is never too far
I just reach out my hand turn the dial
And I know it will make me smile

Cause this station
(H.A.P.P.Y.)
(We plan to help your day go by)
I said it's a musical natural high
Yes it is
On Station H.A.P.P.Y.

Don't you know that it's a musical
Natural
On station H.A.P.P.Y.
H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan we plan... by by by
H.A.P.P.Y.

It's a musical
Natural
H.A.P.P.Y.

Just by mistake
One day I turned on my dial
From my radio came this is incredible sound
The music they were playing right next to me
I start clapping my hands and stomping my feet

'Cause they were H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan to help your day go by by by
It's a musical natural
Oh Station H.A.P.P.Y.
H.A.P.P.Y.
Hey hey hey
Woo
