Child, you oughta been there, night fo' last
Seen sister shakin' her tailfeather
You oughta been there, night fo' last
Watching grandpa getting his thing together


Then grandpa headed onto the floor
Said hold my cane, son, and watch me go
'Cause I'm feeling sixteen, not sixty-four
And all of the hippies started screaming and screaming
Go grandpa go! Go grandpa go!


You oughta know that, I'm comin' easy
Wastin' no time, gettin' busy
Doing the or little Hucklebuck
And for an old girl, she really knew her stuff
Then somebody turned the lights down the low
And said we got to lock all the doors
And then up jumped Doctor Feelgood
And he started to do a twist
And said "I ain't never been in a joint like this"
Ow!


Ohh, the cuckoo-clock started striking four
The band said we're sorry but it's time to go
Somebody plugged the jukebox up in the floor
Oh then up jumps Skinny-Minny, doin' the shimmy-shimmy
Out went daddy waving a piece of barbeque


You oughta been there, night fo' last
Child, you oughta been there, night fo' last
, night fo' last
Skinny-Minny was doin' the shimmy child, night fo' last
Oh they was lettin' their hair down, night fo' last
