We've got all night
Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets
I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better
Call it love

You say you won't
I say you will
You make me crazy
But I want you still
When it makes us feel better
Call it love

Do we tell the truth
Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good
Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words
Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love

I play my hand
You call my bluff
We push each other
'Til we've had enough
When it's all you've got
Call it love

If I didn't have money
Would you want me still
When you look real close
Do we fit the bill
Call it what you want
But only time will tell

Do we tell the truth
Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good
Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words
Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love

We've got all night
Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets
I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better
Call it love

Call it love
Call it love
Call it love
When it's all you've got
Call it love
