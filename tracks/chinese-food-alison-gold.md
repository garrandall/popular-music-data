After balling I go clubbing
Then Iâm hugging
Then Iâm hungry and Iâm walking on the street
and Iâm getting getting getting getting grumpy grumpy

I see Chow, by my right
I smell food in the air
Itâs Chinese Food, my favorite
So Iâm getting getting getting getting hungry

I love Chinese food (Yeah)

Read the menu
They got broccoli
Even chicken wings
Make it spicy
And you like it
Cause itâs beautiful
And it tastes so so so good

And the wonton soup
This makes me feel so so good
Fortune cookies, tell my future

Yo!
I like Chinese food
And some Wonton soup
Get me broccoli
While I play Monopoly
Donât be a busy bee
Cause itâs your fantasy
To eat Chinese food
Egg roll and Chop Suey
I use the chopsticks
To eat pot sticks
Put some hot sauce and sweet and sour make it sweet
Because Chinese food takes away my stress
Now Iâm going to go eat Panda Express
