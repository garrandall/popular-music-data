(special technique) Fuck that
(special technique of shadowboxing) God damn
(The GZA, god damn!)
(The GZA, god damn!) Pledge allegiance to the hip-hop!
(Method, god damn!) I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
(Maximilli-on, Maximilli-on)
(Uh, yeah, ahh, uh) Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
(Johnny Blaze) Maximilli-on
Maximilli-on


I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking Johnny Blazing, 
nightmares like Wes Craven niggaz gunning, 
my third eye seen it coming Before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten Kids they smashing
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your assHOLE
You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky eye and snot nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe I keeps it moving, 
know just what the fuck I'm doing - rap insomniac, 
fiend to catch a nigga snoozing, slip the cardiac 
Arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop posses me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass 
alley cat top pedigree, the head toucher, 
industry party bum rusher
You don't like a dick up in ya, fuck ya

(allow me to demonstrate) That's right, you corny-ass
(the skill of Shaolin) rap motherfuckers
(The special technique) Better go back and check
(of shadowboxing) your fucking stacks
(Shadowboxing) Cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your reefs ain't rugged enough
Bitch


I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggaz came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round em off to the nearest third
Check these non visual niggaz, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggaz can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggaz bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA, to charge niggaz twenty G's a session


When my mind start to clicking, and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotten-picking FUCK
About a brother trying to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa Bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, 'Protect Ya Neck'
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nutsac, and spitting lung-ghies
At a wack nigga that, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill projects
How to be exact, break it down
All and Together Now
Things are getting good looking better now

(Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin)
(Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing)
(Shadowboxing)
