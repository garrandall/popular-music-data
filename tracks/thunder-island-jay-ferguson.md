Ooh, yeah

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

Sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your hair undone
Can you hear me now
Callin' your name from across the bay?
A summer's day laughin' and a-hidin'
Chasin' love out on Thunder Island

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

She was the color of the Indian summer
And we shared the hours without number
Until one day when the sky turned dark
And the winds grew wild
Caught by the rain and blinded by the lightning
We rode the storm out there on Thunder Island

I held her close
Until the storm passed
And we fell down laughing in the wet grass
Both our bodies drying in the sunshine
Sweet sunshine

So, sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your dress undone
Now every mile away and every day
Cuts a little bit deeper
I'll remember the nights in the cool sand
Makin' love out on Thunder Island

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Goodbye, Thunder Island
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
