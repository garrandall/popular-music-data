But Not For Me
Ketty Lester
Words by Ira Gershwin and Music by George Gershwin
Peaked at # 41 in 1962
Previously a # 12 hit for Harry James in 1942
Sung in the 1930 musical "Girl Crazy" by Ginger Rogers and reprised by Willie Howard
Sung
In the 1943 film "Girl Crazy" by Judy Garland
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more clouds are gray
Than any rainy day, could guarantee
I was a fool to fall, and get that way
I should have known the price, I'd have to pay
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not, -------------, for me

Another Version:
But Not For Me
George and Ira Gershwin
- From sheet music
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
She's knocking on the door, but not for me
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same
Was I the moth or flame, I'm all at sea
It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with the marriage knot
And there's no knot for me
