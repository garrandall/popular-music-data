Howdy, howdy...

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Ride it, girl
Ride it, ride it
Slip and slide it
That's the way
Yeah, yeah, you got it

Come on, come on
Get wild, girl
I'll be the horse
And you can be the cowgirl

Go put your Daisy Dukes on
Oh, yeah, you got it going on
The way you roll them hips
I like to see you dip, baby

It's time to get wet and wild
And ride out, ride out, girl child

Come on, come on, girl, stunt
Yo, let me see that juicy butt
Up and down, up and down
Back and forth throughout the hood now

So, you go, girl
Just work and jerk
And twist and twerk

You know what I'm talking about
Put a hump in your back
And ride on out


One time for the rodeo, uh
Come on, just ride it, baby
One time for the rodeo, uh
Come on, just ride it, girl
One time for the rodeo, uh
Come on and let's ride on out now
One time for the rodeo, uh
Put a hump in your back
And ride it, girl

I wanna ride it, baby (oh, yeah)
I wanna ride it, baby (ride it, girl)
I wanna ride it, baby (ride out now)
I wanna ride it
Put a hump in your back
And ride it, girl

Get down to the nitty gritty
Ride that thing like Bronco Billy

Okay, okay, girl, now you got it
So go and tell your friends about it
It's live all the way out
95 South getting ready to ride

That thang, don't be ashamed
It ain't nothing but a g-string thing
So, come on, get served, one more gear
Oh, you ain't heard

Yo, work that body, work that body
And yo, D, pass that Bacardi
So I can get my freak on
And ride out to the rodeo, sir

Hey, girl, yeah, I'm talking to you
I got a little something
I want you to do

Get down to the nitty gritty and
Ride that thing like Bronco Billy



I wanna ride it, baby (oh, yeah)
I wanna ride it, baby (ride it, girl)
I wanna ride it, baby (ride out now)
I wanna ride it
Put a hump in your back
And ride it, girl

Ride it, ride it
Slip and slide it
That's the way
Yeah, yeah, you got it

Ride, ride, slip and slide
