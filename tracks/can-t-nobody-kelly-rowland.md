Trying to let you know what it's all about
I know you wanna leave
So many little games silly people play
Don't act foolishly
I'm so real, so soft to the touch
My love, my kiss so sweet, glorious
The look on your face
Anyone can see
No one does it like me


Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody love you like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na, na na na, na na


I knew you'd be the one to come out your mouth
I need you please to relax
I know I messed up but if you leave me now
Ain't no coming back, no more
No me, no you, no us, no kiss, no hugs, tell the truth
See I'm the only one that can love you babe
You're not that big a fool


Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody love you like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na, na na na, na na


Can't no one else but me
Do the things that I do to you
The things that I do to you
Can't no one else but me
Do the things that I do to you
The things that I do to you


Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody love you like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na, na na na, na na
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody love you like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na, na na na, na na
