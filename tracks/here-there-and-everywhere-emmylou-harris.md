Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands thru his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking
But he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere
