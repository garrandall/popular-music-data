...
Tell me, are you listening
Tell me, can you hear?
Better get yourself together boy
Oh, before I disappear
'Cause I ain't gonna take it
Take it anymore
I said I'd be your lover
Never said I'd be... more
Do I have to sit and listen
To you tell me lies
The time has come
To break these ties

(You better listen)
You've got a lot to learn
You're gonna tumble
When I let you fall
(You better listen)
You're gonna feel the burn
And be a victim
Of your own desire
'Cause I'm gonna fight
Fire with fire

You say you got a little lonely
I get lonely too
That don't make you right, now
I wouldn't be there with you

Baby, when it happens
Oh, time and time again
It gets a little harder
Oh, to pretend

Oh, do I have to sit and listen
To you tell me lies
Time has come
To break these ties, hey

(You better listen)
You've got a lot to learn
You're gonna tumble
When I let you fall
(You better listen)
You're gonna feel the burn
And be a victim
Of your own desire
'Cause I'm gonna fight
Fire with fire

Oh, fire with fire
Fire with
Fire with fire
You're gonna feel the burn
Fire with fire
Oh, fire with fire

Oh
(You better listen)
You've got a lot to learn
You're gonna tumble
When I let you fall
(You better listen)
You're gonna feel the burn
And be a victim
Of your own desire

(You better listen)
You've got a lot to learn
You're gonna tumble
When I let you fall
(You better listen)
You're gonna feel the burn
And be a victim
Of your own desire
'Cause I'm gonna fight
Fire with fire
Fire with fire (fire)
Fire with fire
Ooh ooh ooh
Be a victim
Of your own desire
Gonna fight
Fire with fire, oh
You better listen, boy
