Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
She walked like you do
I thought it was you
As she turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you?
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
