When I'm with my guy, and he watches all the pretty girls go by
And I feel so hurt, deep inside, I wish that I could die


Not a word do I say
I just look the other way


'Cause that's the way boys are
That's the way boys are


When he treats me rough, and he acts as though he doesn't really care
Well, I never tell him that he is so unfair


Plus, he loves me, and I know it
But he's just afraid to show it


'Cause that's the way boys are
That's the way boys are


Oh, when he wants to be alone, I just let him be
'Cause I know that soon enough, he will come back to me


When we have a fight, I think that I won't see him anymore
Then before I know it, there he is: standin' at my door


Well I let him kiss me there and then
'Cause I know he wants me back again


That's the way boys are
Yes, that's the way boys are
Oh, I love him!
Well, now, that's the way boys are
I said that's the way boys are
