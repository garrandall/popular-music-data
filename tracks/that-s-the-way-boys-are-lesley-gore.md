When I'm with my guy and he watches the pretty girls go by
Well it hurts so bad deep inside, I wish that I could die
Not a word do I say
I just look the other way
Cause that's the way boys are
That's the way boys are

When he treats me rough and he acts as though he doesn't care
Well I never tell him that he is being so unfair
Cause he loves me and I know it
He is just afraid to show it
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are

Oh, when he wants to be alone
I just let him be
Cause I know that soon enough
He'll come back to me
He'll come back to me

When we have a fight
And I don't think that I'll see him anymore
But before I know it there he is
Standin at my door
Well I let him kiss me then
Cause I know he wants me back
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
That's the way boys are
