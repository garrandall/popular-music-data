Magic of your smile
Lights my candle
The tenderness we share
Lets me know that you care

Something 'bout the way
Your touch moves me with gladness
Makes me happy, baby
And in the sweetest way
Chases away all the sadness

Some right, some wrong
Sweet nights, sweet songs
It's so weak but so long
It's too tight and too strong

Million dollar feeling
Comes all over my body
Ah, sing it to the ceiling, Lord
So we know what you're humming

Cast your faith in my direction
Lay your sweet hand in mine
So glad I'm your selection, Lord
I think our love
Stands any test of time, oh

Some right, some wrong
Sweet nights, sweet songs
It's so weak but so long
It's too tight and too strong

Something about your loving
Something about your loving

Some right, some wrong
Sweet nights, sweet songs
It's so weak but so long
It's too tight and too strong
Some right, some wrong
Sweet nights, sweet songs
It's so weak but so long
It's too tight and too strong
Some right, some wrong
Sweet nights, sweet songs
