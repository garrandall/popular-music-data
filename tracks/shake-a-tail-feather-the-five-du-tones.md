I heard about the fella you been dancin' with
All over the neighborhood
So why didn't you ask me baby?
Or didn't you think I could?
Well I know that the Rock and Roll is not for shy
I seen the women bird all night
Well if that was you and me out there baby
I would have shown you how to do, do it right
Do it right, do it right
Do it right, do it right

Ah!
Twistin'
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Here we go loop-de-loop
Shake it up, baby
Here we go loop-de-lie
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather

Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather

Ah!
Twistin'
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Here we go loop-de-loop
Shake it up, baby
Here we go loop-de-lie
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over let me see you shake your tail feather

Ah!
Twistin'
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby

Ah!
Twistin'
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake it up, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it now, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it all around, shake it, shake
Do the twist, do the flea, do the swim, do
