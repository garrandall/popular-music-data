Pain, it's as dark as the night
Keeps you up-tight
Forever you fight
You try to break the bondage you experience
Deranged, delirious, mentally serious
Tell ME how do I break the chains on my brain
My mind, my body, my soul
I need total control
Of my freedom and my liberty
When will it be for all?
All Berlin walls must fall
The physical torture and mental oppression
The anguish of depression
Life is a lesson
That you've got to study hard because the hard times
Are grippin' and whippin'
Quit slippin'
Don't be a slave just create a positive state
Don't break just make and take
Be great
Don't be controlled just be strong never doubt your tomorrow
And we'll hear you scream out...


SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!


When it rains it pours
For pain is a force
Let happiness be your source and keep goin' for yours
I know old Dante pulled you in The Inferno
But pain you learn though is not eternal
So now you're in the dungeon, on the wall you hang
You try everything, the pendulum still swings
You're down on your knees and prayin' Oh My GOD
Tell me why this life has to be so hard
Is it all in the cards?
Yeah, deal me a new one
And maybe life won't be so lonely and gruesome
But I'ma tell you son -- before you begin
Even with a bad hand, you can bluff and win
So put your chips on the table you're able to do the task
Unmask the executioner and take his axe
And break the chains that bind and confine your mind this is your time
Unleash and unwind put pain behind
Climb out of the pit of darkness and start this new breed
For this is what we need
Don't be held down and hellbound be strong and profound
Unfasten the leather that's strappin' you down
Dig down and get up and you'll be swingin' the soul sound
A New Day is coming, the sun don't frown
Don't conform be confined or obey
Nelson Mandela breathes the air of a New Day
So now you're a number in the prison of a hardened soul
But be brave and behave and you may get parole
So there's HOPE, and hope is a pleasant thing
Over the horizon I see the sun, I hear you sing...


SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!



Solar energy within ME all through ME
It's the sun full of light bringing power and might
All right makin' everything start to swing
You be the king or queen of your own dream
Life can be supreme, it's a special thing
Just keep the faith through the night time
You operate smooth and you might find
All of the loving, the bliss, the joy -- a happy deal
Friendship and jubilee, you live The Elysian fields
For real -- you need to feel unchained and free
Into the ME PHI ME
And you are in the rat race, so put an your gym shoes
Run emphatically, step on them blues
Choose the right path and be on your way
And you'll be able to say
What a wonderful life!


SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!
