It used to be, I could call you mine alone.
But now I see,
You want to be left on your own.
You must have someone new.
To make me go through,
Black nights,

Oh, it used to be,
We could have so much fun.
Just you and me,
When our working day was done,
But now when I get home,
You either tired or you are gone
Black nights.

It used to be,
When you see my face you would smile.
And happily,
You d run to me just like a child.
But now you in some kind of daze
Little girl you ve changed your ways
Black nights.

It used to be,
Black nights were never known,
Now it s plain to see,
I ll have these blues from now on.
Your love for me has left,
And you ll soon be gone yourself,
Black nights
