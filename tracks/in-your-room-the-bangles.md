I love it in your room at night
You're the only one who gets through to me
In the warm glow of the candlelight
Oh, I wonder what you're gonna do to me.

(In your room)
I come alive when I'm with you
I'll do anything you want me to
In your room.

I love it in your room all day
When you're gone I like to try on all your clothes
You won't regret it if you let me stay
I'll teach you everything that a boy should know.

(In your room)
I'm alive when I'm with you
Gonna make your dreams come true
In your room.

I feel good in your room
Let's lock the world out
Feels so good when we kiss
Nobody ever made me crazy like this.

I love it in your room at night
You're the only one who gets through to me
In the warm glow of the candlelight
Oh, I wonder what you're gonna do to me.

(In your room)
I'll do anything you want me to
Only wanna be with you
In your room, in your room.

I feel good in your room
Let's lock the world out
Feels so good when we kiss
Nobody ever made me crazy like this.

In your room, in your room.
(In your room...in your room)
(In your room...in your room)
(In your room).
