If we are one big happy family, no one would have to beg
To eat.
If we live in a world of dignity, no man would have to
Live on the street.
If I tell you you're a part of me, there's no need for
Disbelief.
Here is my hand, to let you know that what we dream we
All can hold.
Apart we are weak... together we're strong.


Oh, people... we are writing this song. We're all living
These words together forever.
There's no reason we can't live and be one...
Build the world that we want together.
For as long as you stand here by me... we'll live on.

Think of all the possibilities that the eyes of a child
Can see.
Think of all the opportunities that float right by you
And me.
Take my hand, and we will know all that we dream... we,
Our own.
Apart we are weak... together we're strong.
