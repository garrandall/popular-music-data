One, two, three, go

She's the one
Don't let her get away
She's the one
Believe me when I say

She stole my love
And now she's gotta pay

She's the one
I'd like to let her go
She's the one
Cause I ought to know

She stole my love
And now she's gotta pay

It's not right
For her to run around
She took my love and
Stomped it to the ground, woo

She's the one
Who stole my love from me
She's the one
But I won't set her free

She stole my love
And now she's gotta pay

It's not right
For her to run around
She took my love and
Stomped it to the ground, woo

She's the one
Who stole my love from me
She's the one
But I won't set her free

She stole my love
And now she's gotta pay

One more time

She's the one
Who stole my love from me
She's the one
And I won't set her free

She stole my love
And now she's gotta pay
