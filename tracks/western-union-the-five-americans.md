Things went wrong today
Bad news came my way
I woke up to find
That I had blew my mind

Western Union man
Bad news in his hand
Knocking at my door
Selling me the score

Fifteen cents a word to read
A telegram I didn't need
Says she doesn't care no more
Think I'll throw it on the floor

Got your cable just today
Tell the girl what I've got to say...ay
Western Union
Dit, da dit, da dit

Now you've gone away, and
How it's sad to say you've gone
I remember what they said
Now I'm going out of my head
Telegram just had to say
You've learned your lesson all the way...ay

(BREAK)

Telegram just had to say
You've learned your lesson all the way...ay
Western Union
Dit, da dit, da dit

I'll be on my way 'cause
There's another girl for me
I'll be sure of her, and
Things will be as they were
Western Union
Oh, Western Union
Western Union
Western Union (fade)
