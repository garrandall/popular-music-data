Saw you leaning against that old record machine
Saw the name of your band written on the marquee
It's a full moon tonight, so we getting rowdy
Yeah, we getting rowdy
Get-get-getting rowdy


Feeling like I'm a high schooler
Sipping on a warm wine cooler
Hot, 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top, like I'm working at Hooters
We been keeping it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come, give me some of that yum, like a lollipop
Let me set you free


Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon


Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubblegum from the corner mexi mart
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark
Causing trouble in the dark
Trou-trou-trouble in the dark


Feeling like a sabertooth tiger
Sipping on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and gimme that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all nighter
We been keeping it kosher
But I wanna get it on fo' sure
Come, give me some of the yum, like a lollipop
Baby, don't be scared


Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon


I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now
I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now
So c'mon!


Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
