Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now


I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?


I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!


I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?


I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet


I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?


I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream "help!" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains


I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah ah," you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
