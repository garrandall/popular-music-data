Bom bom bom

Lay your head on her shoulder
Give out a little sigh-yi-yi
Talk a walk in the moonlight
With a twinkle in your eye

And you've got

Hey da da dow
Dow dow doo dow dow
It's a little thing
That they call love
Hey da da dow
Dow dow doo dow dow
It's a little thing
That they call love

If you miss one another and
The day goes slowly by-yi-yi
You can't wait to see him
It's enough to make you cry

Then you've got

Bom bom bom

If you'd give every treasure
Just to be by your si-yi-yi-ide
And every night you're a dreamer
Of being his bride

Then you've got

It's a little thing
That they call love
