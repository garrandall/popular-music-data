Every time I look into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything at all

I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Anything at all
Baby
You got it
