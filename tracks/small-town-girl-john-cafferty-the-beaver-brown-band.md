I work the late shift
At my daddy's shop
I' ve saved some money
But I'm losing some heart

And every evening
When that whistle blows
I hit the road
I want to just keep going

I met this girl
She lives a ways cross town
She wants somebody
She can settle down

Man I been living in
This town too long
I'd pack my bags up,
I'd be out that door, but

This small town girl's got me crazy
I'm falling for a small town girl
She's all that matters
In this whole wide world
Cause I'm falling for
This small town girl

She wants the kind of
Things her mama seen
A little home to
Raise a family

She wears my ring now
And I don't know why
I'll be here
Until the day I die, 'cause

This small town girl's got me crazy
I'm falling for a small town girl
She's all that matters
In this whole wide world
'Cause I'm fallin' for
This small town girl

This small town girl's got me crazy
I'm falling for a small town girl
She's all that matters
In this whole wide world
'Cause I'm fallin' for
This small town girl

This small town girl's got me crazy
I'm falling for a small town girl
Small town girl's got me crazy
Fallin' for a small town girl
Small town girl's got me crazy
Fallin for that small town girl
