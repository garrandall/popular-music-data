Mercy don't think she's pretty no more,
Starin' at the stars through her back screen door,
She tries and tries to make it all work out,
No matter what she does,
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
You can count on me,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
It just tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries,
Ooh, I wonder why,

Mercy don't have a lover no more,
She plays with her pillow,
Stares at the bedroom floor,
Used to have a million,
They've come and gone,
No matter what she does,
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
You can count on me,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries,
Ooh, yeah

Livin', lovin', give it everything you've got,
After all the heartache,
Maybe give love just one more shot yeah,

In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
The only thing I really wanna know is why,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
