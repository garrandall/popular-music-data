I, I've got the room upstairs from you
It's a room without a view
But all that could change if I just get through, up to you
And I, keep my feelings to myself
I've never reached for someone else
But lately I'm thinking how cold I've been
And now I begin to see that I should
Dare to fall and with your help tear down the walls

Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah

And so, here I am with no disguise
You're not the only one who's surprised
But something so simple could so long to be
Can't you see that opposites, they say attract
It's just a typical reaction

Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah

I ain't gonna look much further now
And I ain't gonna try to reason how
'Cause I know if this turns into love
Strange but true, it's good enough

Maybe I should dare to fall
And with your help tear down these walls
That opposites, they say attract
It's just a typical reaction

Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah
Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah

Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah
