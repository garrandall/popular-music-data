I guess I'm crazy for loving you
You tell me many ways that I won't do
My heart keeps sayin' that I'm a fool
I guess I'm crazy for loving you

I don't dare let you go it's unfair this I know
I don't care if it's so, it has to be
My heart keeps sayin' that I'm a fool
I guess I'm crazy for loving you

I don't dare let you go it's unfair this I know
I don't care if it's so, it has to be
My heart keeps sayin' that I'm a fool
I guess I'm crazy for loving you...
