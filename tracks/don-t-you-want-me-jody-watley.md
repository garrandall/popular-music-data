When I first laid my eyes upon you
I knew right then and there you were the one
Eyes so deep, you sent me melting
And then you smiled as though to say, "oh yeah"


But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were oh, so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh ho


Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night


I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're coming from


Are you looking for a new love
Or does commitment seem to bring you down
Is that a look of "yes" or is it "no"?
Please don't tease me, oh


Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

Oh woah, yeah
Don't you want me?
Oh woah, yeah
Don't you want me?


Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night


Are you looking for a new love
Or does commitment seem to bring you down
Is that a look of "yes" or is it "no"?
Please don't tease me, oh


Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night


Want me (oh woah), don't you want me (yeah)
(Don't you want me?)
Want me (oh woah), don't you want me (yeah, yeah)
(Don't you want me?)
