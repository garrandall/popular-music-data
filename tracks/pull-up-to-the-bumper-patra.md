Ay so
Hahaha
A wha' this?
Chat 'bout?!
How you fi say that? See it yah
You waan fit inside my space? You wanna see my headlamp and my bumper, right?
Let me tell you something, baby. Red light, and green light, yellow light
Take the green light because that's the go light
And once you hit the go light you know say everything is right
Right?
Make me tell you something, baby
Come inna mi limousine
And you know wha' we ago do, right?
Make love into the night
Only 'til the ecstasy
Check this!


Riding down the city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you paint your favorite dreams
Somewhere in this town, ohooh
Now in the parking lot garage, I found the proper place
Pull up in the middle, baby, and fit into my space


Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine, ohooh
Pull up to my bumper baby
Drive it in between


Check this nuh!
Pull up to mi bumper, watch the indicator
When you a turn left, right, and center
No bother hit the curb when you a enter
If you hit the curb, then you know you turn over
Green light, press the accelerator
When you see the red light, you know that a danger
No bother slow down when you see the
Speed trap, don't pull over


Pull up to it
Don't cry, do it
Rock it up twice
Feels good? It's nice


No bother drive two side like a learn you deh learn
Put on your indicator when you deh turn
Straight up my street, make your tires dem burn
Please don't overturn


Operate around the clock
Won't you just come in? ohooh
I got plans for everyone
One for you my friend, ohooh
I'm not sure where to go, but I must find a place
Come into my bedroom, baby, and fit into my space


Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine, ohooh
Pull up to my bumper baby
Drive it in between


Pull up to it
Don't cry, do it
Rock it up twice
Feels good? It's nice


Riding down the city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you paint your favorite dreams
Somewhere in this town, ohooh
In the parking lot garage I found the proper place
Come into the middle, baby, and fit into my space


Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine, ohooh
Pull up to my bumper baby
Drive it in between


Check this!
Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine, ohooh
Pull up to my bumper baby
Drive it in between
