I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete

We started over coffee, we started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin

This time it's different,


Dah dah dah dah


It's all because of you,


Dah dah dah dah


It's better than it's ever been


'Cause we can talk it through


Oh, my favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say


To take my breath away
This is it, oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one, to be with every night


'Cause whatever I do,


It's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone,


Oh someone


I finally found someone,


Oh...


Did I keep you waiting,


I didn't mind


I apologize,


Baby, that's fine


I would wait forever


Just to know you were mine


You know I love your hair,


Are you sure it looks right?


I love what you wear,


Isn't it too tight?


You're exceptional,


I can't wait for the rest of my life...
This is it, oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one, to be with every night


'Cause whatever I do,


It's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone,


Whatever I do,


It's just got to be you


My life has just begun
I finally found someone...
