I will love you anyway
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you want to be

I just want to satisfy ya
You're not mine and I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Whou, ohh, sweet thang
Don't ya know you're my everything
Whou ohh, sweet thang
Don't ya know you're my everything
Yeah baby

I wish you were my lover
But ya act so undercover
Love ya child my whole life long
Is be right or be wrong

I'm only what ya make me, baby
Don't walk away, don't be so shady
Don't want your mind, don't want your money
These words I say, they may sound funny but

Whou, ohh, sweet thang
Oh ya know you're my everything
Whou ohh, sweet thang
Boy ya know you're my everything
Hey baby

OOOOOOO

You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weak with soft desire
Love ya child my whole life long
Is be right or be wrong

I just want to satisfy ya
'Cause you're not mine, I can't deny it
Can't ya hear me talking, baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Can't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Can't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Can't you hear me talkin', baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
