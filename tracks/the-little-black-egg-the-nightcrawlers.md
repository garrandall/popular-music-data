I don't care what they say
I'm gonna keep it anyway
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks

I found it in a tree just the other day
Now it's mine all mine, they can't take it away

There comes Mary, there comes Lee
I'll bet what they want to see
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks

I found it in a tree just the other day
And now it's mine all mine, they can't take it away

Oh bother, what can I do ? Little black agg's gonna tell on you
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks

My little black egg (multiple x until fade out)
