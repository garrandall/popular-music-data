Would you lay with me
In a field of stone
If my needs were strong
Would you lay with me

Should my lips grow dry
Would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour
If my lips were dry

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hands
If I give myself to you

Will you bathe with me
In the stream of life
When the moon is full
Will you bathe with me

Will you still love me
When I'm down and out
In my time of trial
Will you stand by me

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hands
If I give myself to you

Would you lay with me
In a field of stone
Should my lips grow dry
Would you wet them dear
Would you bathe with me
In the stream of life
Would you still love me
When I'm down and out
