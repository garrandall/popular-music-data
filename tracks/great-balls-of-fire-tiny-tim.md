You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain
Too much loving
Drives a man insane

You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire

I laughed at love
Cause I thought it was funny
You came along
And moved me, honey

I changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire

Kiss me, baby
Oh, feels so good
Hold me, baby

I want to love you
Like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I got to tell this world that
You're mi-yi-yi-yine

I chew my nails and
Then I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous
But it sure is fun

Come on, baby
You drive my crazy
Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire

Well, kiss me, baby
Owww, feels so good
Hold me, baby, oww

I want to love you
Like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I got to tell this world that
You're mi-yi-yi-yine

I chew my nails and then
I twiddle my thumbs
Real nervous
But it sure is fun

Come on, baby
You drive my crazy
Goodness gracious
Great balls of fire
