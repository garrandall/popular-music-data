Chained to a love
But that don't mean much
Sensitive tough, you don't get enough
I've been drowning in your, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up

I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

Beautiful as you are, I wanna light up your dark
Maybe you don't believe in me
It's hard to know what you see in me
Don't be quick to say no
My chest is your pillow
Come out of the shadows, I know that you're fragile, yeah

I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I'm right here, you know, when your waves explode
Escape the undertow
Know that you've been broken
Know that you've been hoping
Swimming in your ocean
A new life is floating
The stars were made to shine
Reach up and make a wish
It's a beautiful time, I hope you take a glimpse
We're the sound of lovers blowing crazy in the wind
You don't have to pretend
I don't care where you've been

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
