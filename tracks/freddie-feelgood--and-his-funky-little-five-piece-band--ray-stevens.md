Well they got a tight little unit you know they're the most 
Famous all over from coast to coast 
A-really layin' down the sound as much as you can stand (yeah, yeah) 
They got 3 outfits a red yellow and blue 
Volkswagon station wagon, luggage carrier too 
Got their name painted on the side you know it looks so grand 
I'm talkin' 'bout Freddie Feelgood and his Funky Little Five Piece Band
Whoa yeah 

They got a drummer named Yum-Yum he can really go some 
Blows real cool, makes all the girls drool 
They got a cat named Ace, he blows the bass 
They got another named Tyrone he plays trompone 
Cat named Percy, have mercy, plays piano in the treble cleff 
And the trumpet man, he's the leader of the band 
Yeah that's Freddie Feelgood hisself 
Ahh, work out now! 



Well they're packin' 'em in every place they go 
Everybody starts to rockin' on the dancehall floor 
Stompin' their feet to the rhythm and clappin' their hands (yeah, yeah) 
Yeah you can bet everybody's gonna have a good time 
'Cause the music they play you know it sounds so fine 
It's the kind with a down-home beat that you can understand 
I'm talkin' 'bout Freddie Feelgood and his Funky Little Five Piece Band
Whoa yeah
Ahh, work out now!
