Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings

Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings

(Would it be true to say)

Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare
When Smokey sings

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings
Smokey sings
Smokey sings
