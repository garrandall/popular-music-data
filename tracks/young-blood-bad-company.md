I saw her standing on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't keep myself from callin'
Look a there, look a there, look a there, look a there

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I fractured
I tried to walk and I was lame
I couldn't keep myself from shoutin'
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name,
What's your name

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad I met her dad he said
You better leave my daughter alone

I couldn't sleep that night for crying
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night long my heart was sighin'
Cause she's the one, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
