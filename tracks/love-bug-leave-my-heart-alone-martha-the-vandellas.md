Oh yeah
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
Leave my heart alone
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)

Spring is here and like a wayward breeze
The love that left me came back haunting me
He's like the ever changin' sun that warms my heart and leaves
The love but tries to bite again
Ooh I'm falling, the same old heartaches calling

Oh yeah
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
I don't wanna love him
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)

Behind each gentle word he speaks, love bug there you hide
To stir my tender feelings through his words of honey
But if you wait to sleep in love, I bear it deep inside
Love bug you love and leave me sobbing and sighing
Again he'll leave me cryin'

Oh yeah
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)

I'm telling you love bug, love bug, hope you fly away
Spread your little wings, leave my heart and fly away
'Cause I don't want to love a guy who truly don't love me
I don't want the heartaches that I had before

He wants me for the moment and another girl he'll see
And through long and sleepless nights
When I'm tossin' and turnin'
My heart will be burning

Oh yeah, leave my heart alone
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
I don't wanna love him
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
You know, you know that he don't love me
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
Oh, don't give me the fever, I
(Get out of here love bug, leave my heart alone)
