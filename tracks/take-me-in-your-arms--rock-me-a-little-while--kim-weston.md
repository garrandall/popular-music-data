Take me in your arms
Hold me for a little while
Hey, baby

So I know you're leavin', leave me behind
I'm seein' you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while

We all must feel heartache sometimes
Right now, right now, I'm feeling mine
I've tried my best to be strong, I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child left in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Just once more, darling, before you leave

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while

I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is over, I must confess
I'll never, never see your smilin' face no more
I'll never, never hear your knock on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Let me feel happy just one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while

I said I wouldn't beg, I said I wouldn't plead
Here I am, baby, I'm beggin' you, please
Baby, please, baby, please

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while
