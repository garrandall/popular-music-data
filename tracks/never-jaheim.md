I used to be the kind of brother
That thought I would never slow down
I used to swear that I don't even care what happens but baby right now
I see that, you changed my mind
I mean that, and it took some time
But now I understand, I can be a better man
I never had a chance to meet a lover quite like you
You revealed another part in me, girl your love is tried and true
Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say, never
Will I love this way
Never, Give my heart away
Never, would this player hang his jersey up and leave the game
Never, would have thought in a million years, I would be here
That's why I say never, would I know the truth
Never, would I know that you would come into my life and make everything new
Never, would have thought I would take your hand, girl I swear...
I would never never never never never say never again
Again(x2)
Baby baby baby, baby
Baby baby baby, baby
Baby baby baby, baby baby baby

There ain't no question that I love you
I know we've had our ups and downs
But through the tears I know there is no where I can say I'd rather be now
I see that, you're my shining star
I mean that, girl you got my heart, and now I hold your hand cause you made me a stronger man
I wish that I could place the whole world in front of you, but a man is just a man so baby here's my vow to you, babe :
Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say, never, will I love this way
Never, give my heart away
Never would this player hang his jersey up and leave the game
Never would've thought in a million years, I would be here
And that's why I say never, had I known the truth
Never, would I know that you would come into my life and make everything new
Never would've thought I would take your hand, girl I swear
I would never never never never never, say never..

From the day you came along
I song a brand new song
'Cause I want to make it clear that see, that you're a special part of me
Before I had no clue, I was lost till I found you baby
And I want to make the whole world understand I'm proud to be your man
And I vow to stay forever
I can't believe that I used to, say...
Never, would I love this way
Give my heart away
Never would this player hang his jersey up and leave the game
Never, no no no, never, no no no no, no , no
Never, Never
I never would have thought I would take your hand
I would never never never never never never never...never, never say never again
Again..
