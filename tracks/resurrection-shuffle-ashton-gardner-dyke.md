Twist yourself further from the middle of the floor
Throw a little kiss to the woman next door
Step on the gas, put your hand in the air
Make a peace sign and you throw back your hair

Think about nothing, now you're nice and high
You're advocating love but you don't know why
Now you're getting vibrations all down to your feet
That's the brow beating, heavy leather, resurrection beat

Put your hand on your hip
Now you let your backbone slip
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air
Make a peace sign, you just don't care

Now you feel free, you gotta lose control
All God's children got a little bit of soul
You don't have to think, you don't have to move a muscle
To do the brow beating, heavy leather, resurrection shuffle

All right
Oh, here we go again
Oh, that's it, you're doing it
All right

You think about nothing, now you're nice and high
You're advocating love but you don't know why
You're getting vibrations all down to your feet
That's the brow beating, heavy leather, resurrection beat

Here we go
Put your hand on your hip
You gotta let your backbone slip
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air
Make a peace sign like you just don't care

Now you feel free, you gotta lose control
All God's children got some soul
You don't have to think, you don't have to move a muscle
To do the brow beating, heavy leather, resurrection shuffle, oh

You're doing all right
This is gonna last you for years and years, and it's all right

You're doing all right
Don't get uptight
Uh huh, yeah
That sounds all right
Mmm
Do do do do do do
