(Goodbye, cruel world)
(Goodbye, cruel world)

Oh, goodbye, cruel world
I'm off to join the circus
I'm gonna be a broken-hearted clown
Paint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile
'Cause a mean, fickle woman
Turned my whole world upside-down

(Goodbye, cruel world)

Farewell to love
I'm off to join the circus
Gotta find a way to hide my tears
Then I'll have them rollin' in the aisle
And I'll forget that woman
If it takes a hundred years

(Goodbye, cruel world)

Oh, step right up and take a look at a fool
He's got a heart as stubborn as a mule
Come on, everybody, he's good for a laugh
And no one could tell his heart is broken in half

Well, the joke's on me
I'm off to join the circus
Oh, Mister Barnum, save a place for me
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care
Let the people point at me and stare
I'll tell the world that woman
Wherever she may be
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me

(Goodbye, cruel world)

Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care
Let the people point at me and stare
I'll tell the world that woman
Wherever she may be
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me

Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
