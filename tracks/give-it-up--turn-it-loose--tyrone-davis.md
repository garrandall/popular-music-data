You better turn it loose
You better turn it loose

I went downtown the other day
And I heard a woman say
I do all I can for that man
At home, he still won't stay

I could tell the way
That woman spoke
Her heart was truly broke

She said, if a man
Can't treat his woman right
Give her good loving day and night
He sure oughta

Give it up, turn it loose
(Turn it up loose)
Give it up, turn it loose
(Turn it up loose)

You need your man
To be satisfied
But he tells you no
With no reason why

You will finally find out for yourself
There ain't no love between
The two of you left

When you try as hard as you can
To do what you think is right
And still, you get that
Same old cold shoulder
Oh, that same old shoulder
Late at night, late at night

Here's what you do

When you've done all you can do
GIve it up
When you see it just ain't no use
Turn it loose

Way lay at night
When you're laying down
And you need some hugging
And no one's around

You'll walk around all day long
With love on your mind
You're thinking about the love
That you just get sometime

When you have someone
Sitting there by your side
And ain't no company at all
All you need is a little loving touch
And when you don't get it
It hurts you so much

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, baby, turn it loose
