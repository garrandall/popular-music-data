A million to one
That's what our folks think
About this love of ours
A million to one
They're saying our love will fade
Like yesterday's flowers

They're betting everything
That our love won't survive
They're hoping in time
We'll forget each other's alive

A million to one
They feel we're too young
To know the meaning of love
A million to one
That they've forgotten the dreams
That we're dreaming of

But we'll forgive them
Because we love them
After all is said and done
They're one in a million
A million to one

But we'll forgive them
Because we love them
After all is said and done
They're one in a million
A million to one
