Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the french I took
But I do know that I love you
Snd I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I know that one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be.

I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm tryin' to be
For maybe by being an 'A'-student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the french I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be (La, ta, ta, tata, ta, ta)

History (Hm)
Biology (Woah, la, ta, ta, tata, ta, ta)
Science book (Hm)
French I took (Yeah)
But I do know that I love you,
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be
