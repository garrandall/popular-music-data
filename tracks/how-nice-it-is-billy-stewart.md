How nice it is to be back home
How nice it is to have
Someone to call your own
Oh, I said right now
'Cause you've got someone to love
It makes you feel all right
'Cause you've got someone to love
Everything will be so nice
'Cause you've got someone to love
How nice it is, yeah, mmm
Lord, I said right now
You know that love's
A wonderful feeling
If you know how to use it
Just remember, my friends
Don't ever abuse it
How nice it is to be by her side
How nice it is to hold her hand
And be her guide
Whoa, I said right now
'Cause you've got someone to love
It makes you feel so good
'Cause you've got someone to love
You don't have be alone
'Cause you've got someone to love
How nice it is, yeah, mmm
Don't you know, my girl
Listen to me, my girl
Oh, my darling, dear
I need your love so bad, whoa
How nice, la la la la
How nice, la la la la
