When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na


You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sitting right here real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waiting standby
Can't stop, because I love it
Hate the way I love you
All day, all night
Maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie


I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
I love you much too much to hide you
This love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet
So baby, whenever you're ready


When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na


You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that
(Let me get that, yeah)
And baby, once I get it, I'm yours, no take-backs
Gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever, you're mine
Baby, I'm addicted, no lie, no lie


I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
So baby, whenever you're ready...


When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na


This love will be the death of me
But I know I'll die happily
I'll know, I'll know, I'll know
Because you love me so
Yeah


When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
(I'm gonna get it, yeah yeah)
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
(When you're ready, when you're ready
Come and get it, get it)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
