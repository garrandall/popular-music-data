A-one, a-two, a-one two three four


No more books and studies
And I can stay out late with my buddies
I can do the things that I want to do
'Cause all my exams are through
I can root for the Yankees from the bleachers
And don't have to worry 'bout teachers
And I'm so glad that school is out
I could sing and shout!


(School is out) Everybody gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody gonna jump and run
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out) I just got time to take my girl out on a date
School is out at last
And I'm so glad I passed
So everybody come and go with me!
We're gonna have a night with Daddy G
Ah-blow Daddy!


Ah-that's great!
Let's celebrate!
I'll play it real good now
I'll do the 
Oh yeah!
The party's there!


(School is out) Everybody gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody gonna jump and run
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out) I just got time to take my girl out on a date
School is out at last
And I'm so glad I passed
So everybody come and go with me
We're gonna have a night with Daddy G
Go Daddy!

Blow, blow Daddy
Oh that's great
Ah come on, come on
Yeah, oh yeah

(School is out) Oh yeah, that's really great
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out) Everybody gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody gonna jump and run
Yeah!
