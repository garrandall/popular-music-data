It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
Keep reminding me, oh, to forget your love

You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark (I can't understand)
You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark (I can't understand)

There's no room in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core, still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I try to forget the memories

Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget

You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark (I can't understand)

Remember I told you
To save it, it's over
And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
I got these mementos
And I'll be alright

Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget

You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn (in my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
