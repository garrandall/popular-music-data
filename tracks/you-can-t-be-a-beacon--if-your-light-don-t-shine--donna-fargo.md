You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
How can you ask for the truth
When you do not truthful live
How can you ask forgiveness
When you don't forgive
I don't mean to bring you down or speak to you unkind
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine

How can you ask a child to be honest and true?
When he can only judge what's right by what he sees in you
How can you offer vision, yet walk around blind
No you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
