6:30 in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
(Another nine minutes) Let the world stop
(Another nine minutes) Don't worry about the clock
(Another nine minutes) Ooooh, yeah
(Another nine minutes) Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late

(Another nine minutes) (repeat to fadeout)
