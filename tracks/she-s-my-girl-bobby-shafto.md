I saw her face and I love her
I know that she loves me too
I'm sorry but I must take her
Take her from you


She's my girl, I love her so
She's my girl, so let her go
She's my girl, oh, can't you see
She loves me

Close to my heart, I will keep her
I hope you won't feel too sad
She must be mine 'cause I need her
Need her so bad



She's my once in a lifetime girl
And I know, and I know
I must stay, I must stay by her side

Close to my heart, I will keep her
I hope you won't feel too sad
She must be mine 'cause I need her
Need her so bad



She loves me, she loves me
