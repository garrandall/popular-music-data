I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing
As free as the wind
And hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning
More than this
You know there is nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
You know there is nothing
It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night
Who can say where we're going
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning
More than this
You know there is nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
You know there is nothing
Oooh aaaah
More than this
You know there is nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
There is nothing
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooooh Aaaaaaah Ooooooh
