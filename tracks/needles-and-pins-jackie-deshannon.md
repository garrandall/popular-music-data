I saw him today
I saw his face
It was a face I loved
And I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray-ay
That they'd go away

But still they begin, uh
Needles and pins, uh
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Hey, I thought I was smart
I'd win his heart
Ah, I didn't think I'd lose
But now I see
She's more to him than me
Let him go ahead
Take her love instead
And one day he will see

Just how to say "Please", uh
Oh, and get down on his knees, uh
Hey, that's how it begins, uh
He'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' him, hurtin' him

Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong
I'm wrong, so wrong?
Why can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong?

Because I saw him today
I saw his face
It was a face I loved
I can't let go
Although I know
He'll make me cry
Oh, whoa, whoa
'Til the day I die

But, people
I got to live now
And Lord knows
I should forgive now
Yea, when it begins, uh
He'll feel those needles and pins
A-hurtin' him, a-stop it now
Stop those needles
Stop those pins

Lord, when they begin, uh
Oh, won't you hear what I say?
Somebody, a-take 'em away
A-stop 'em now, a-stop 'em
Stop those needles and pins

Yeah, yeah, oh, when they begin, uh
I feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' me, hurtin' me
Stop 'em now, needles and pins
