It's over, it's over, it's over


Summer came and passed away
Hardly seemed to last a day
But it's over, and what can I do?
Music playing in the air
Silence on a darkened stair
'Cause it's over, and what can I do?


It's over, it's over, all over
It's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down
It's over
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of


Feeling down, down
It's all over
Feeling down, down, down
Baby, baby, it's all gone
Rolled out to sea


Looking over sunny days
Searching for the righteous wave
'Cause it's over, and what can I do?
Looking from this distant shore (distant shore)
You ain't sailing by no more
'Cause it's over (it is over) and what can I do?


It's over, it's over, all over
It's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down
It's over, over, it's over
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of


Feeling down, down
It's over
Feeling down, down, down

Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over
It's all over and what can I do?
Ah, it's over, it's over
It's all over


Oh, it's over, it's over
Don't shed a tear for me, it's over
Don't shed a tear although it's over
