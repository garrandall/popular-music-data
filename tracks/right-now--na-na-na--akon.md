It's been so long (long, long)
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong (strong)
But the strength I have is washing away (way)
It won't be long (long)
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

Girl, I know (know, know)
Mistakes were made between us two
And we showed (showed)
Our eyes that night even said some things weren't true.
Watch you go? (go)
And haven't seen my girl since then (then)
Why can't it be that way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover and friend

I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
'Til I get you back I'm gonna try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
'Til I get you back I'm gonna try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)

I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (said, one that'll grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (oh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (oh, one that'll grind)
Yeah!

I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na) (make up) (oh)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na) (link up, baby)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
I wanna make love right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na) (make up)
