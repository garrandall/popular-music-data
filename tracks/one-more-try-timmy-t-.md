One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go

I brought the money like your lawyer said to do
Ain't nothing funny, babe, I am still in love with you
Said, I am leaving you tomorrow, I'll cause you no more sorrow
One cup of coffee then I'll go

Lord, I say Susie, Susie, Susie, mind you lose me
Know me, love you bad yet you want to abuse me
Try to treat you right but this affair confuse me
Girl, don't complain 'cause a you come fi choose me

Me say Susie do, mind you loose me
Though me love you bad and you want to abuse me
Try treat you right but this a pure confuse me
Gal, no complain 'cause a you come fi loose me

One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go

Said I brought the money, honey, like your lawyer said to do
Ain't nothing funny, babe, I am still in love with you
Leaving you tomorrow 'cause you no more sorrow
One cup of coffee then I'll go

Lord, run up and down, run up and down
Sight the little gal and she a run up and down
Run up and down, run up and down
Sight the little gal and she a run up and down

Though my teeth is my teeth and my gum is my gum
Timmy Tim Tim or my Tummy Tum Tum
Bitter to the belly what is sweet to the tongue
Sight the little gal and she a run up and down

One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go
One cup of coffee then I'll go

Said I brought the money like your lawyer said to do
Ain't nothing funny, babe, I am still in love with you
I'm leaving you tomorrow, you cause me no more sorrow
One cup of coffee then I'll go

That was Raggamuffin this is now Jr. Gong
Telling every woman fi hang on 'pon them man
And I say love him, love him, give him something strong
And give him loving better mek him galang

Love him, love him to the last furlong
Can't do him dat, him tek a next woman
I say love him, love him give him something strong
