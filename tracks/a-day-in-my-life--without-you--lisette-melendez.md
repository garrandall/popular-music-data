You said that you still loved me
Never once believed your eyes
You found a way to touch me
But still inside
You're filled with lies

I never said
I need to love you
But still you know I do

I need you here to feel this moment
My heart depends on you
But my love
I can`t decide so please

My love is in your hands
Just touch my heart
You`ll see
Baby, please


A day in my life without you
Keep your love line close to me
A day in my life without you
Give me your love like it used to be


Those times you caught me crying
You never tried to understand
I need to have you near me
Baby, you need to hold my hand
Don`t ever think I`d fall to pieces

You know my hearts too strong
But deep inside
I know I love you
With you is where I belong

But my love
I can`t decide
So please
My love is in your hands
Touch my heart, you`ll see
Baby, please
