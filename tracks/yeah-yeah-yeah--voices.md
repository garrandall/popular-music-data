I thought
True love for me existed in fairy tales
And two hearts could never beat as one
(Two hearts could never beat as one)

And then one day
You smiled at me so sweetly
And changed my life completely
Now my life has just begun

He makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
The boy makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

My whole world has turned around
Feet planted firmly on the ground
Since he came
Came my way
And I know he’s here to stay
(Here to stay, here to stay, here to stay)

It’s amazing
The way my life is changing
I’m so happy since I found this special boy
(So happy since I found this boy)

I wanna shout it
(Oh)
And tell the world about it
I’m in love and I
I can’t help it
For the he’s the one for me

He makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
The boy makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

My whole world has turned around
Feet planted firmly on the ground
Since he came
(Since he came)
Came my way
(Came my way)
And I know he’s here to stay

You know I never felt this way before
(Yeah, right)
(Sure)
I’m not playing, really
Sometimes boys plays so many games
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, you’re right)
(You’re right about that, that’s true)

You know what I’m talking about
But this boy he’s different
(Save the drama)
I’m serious
He’s different
He’s sweet, he’s smart
And he’s cute too

And most of all
He loves me
He really loves me
He really, really loves me
