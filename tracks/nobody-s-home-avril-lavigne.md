Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it everyday
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again


What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs


She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside


Open your eyes (open your eyes)
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected (you've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you've left behind


Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs


She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside


Her feelings, she hides
Her dreams, she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's falling behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place, yeah


She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside


She's lost inside, lost inside, oh-oh
She's lost inside, lost inside, oh-oh, oh
