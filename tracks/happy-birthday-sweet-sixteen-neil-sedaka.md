Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Happy birthday sweet sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

Tonight's the night I've waited for
Because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen,
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

What happened to that funny face
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

When you were only six I was your big brother
Then when a you were ten we didn't like each other
When you were thirteen You was a funny valentine
But since you've grown up Your future is sewn up
From now on you're gonna be mine, so

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet sixteen
