Miss me baby
When you hear our favorite song 
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that we danced
In the light to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby

And want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
We couldn't wait anymore, left the keys in the door
Took my hand, pulled me down on the kitchen floor
Yeah, we were that crazy
Miss me baby


Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I need you
Miss me baby

Miss me baby
Until you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me
Come back home, I'll be waiting, right here waiting
Miss me baby



And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I need you
Miss me baby

Every time you hear this song
Miss me baby
