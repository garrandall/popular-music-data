Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

They said I would never get this far
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are
Laughing to the bank, like ha, ha, ha
That's it, I'm just talking too much, blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)

So, where did y'all go
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh

I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me
Money tend to show all their tendencies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

Sometimes, every time they let me down
Sometimes, every time they let me down
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh)
When I told you, "Fuck you", you thought I was playin', huh? (Yeah, yeah)
But I meant that shit literally
She wanted to vibe, but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looked at me like she surprised
The pack in the post and I'm home alone,
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist, give a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake, it's guaranteed to fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car, don't make me go and buy a bitch a little Prius
Fuck her on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are decievin'
And I

Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me
Money tend to show all their tendencies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

Sometimes, every time they let me down
Sometimes, every time they let me down
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

It's too late to turn this shit around
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me
Money tend to show all they tendencies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

Sometimes, every time they let me down
Sometimes, every time they let me down
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, so sad

Oh
It's too late
It's too late
