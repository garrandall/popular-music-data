Now I know you aint over there starin at my girl
Yea I know you aint over there starin at my girl
Nigga I know you don't call yourself hollarin at my girl
I know you don't call yourself holarin at my girl

Im the one, with them ones.
Fuck the price on the tag
just throw it in the bag.


Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Look at price tags
where they do that at
Heard that in ATL
When you in ATL
Just ask my baby girl
I treat my lady well
Ain't nothin soso
But I know JD Well
We in a benzes, black white gray C.L.
Got niggas askin did we miss a mercedes sell?
Shit, I wish he was,but Even though he wasnt,
We still doing yo nuts and have a dozen,
The keep that gucci and that louie on my laby l's
Thats the way we feel
Must be nice man
You wit the right man
You aint gotta price scan, or ask how much
Now what I look like
Son im from brooklin, what it look like
You get it cause I got it
I got it so you get it
Do like Luke say, don't stop get it get it
Mami do the speedie
Daddy do tha duffle
Bag full of chips
We aint talkin ruffles


Un-huh un-huh un-huh
just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag


See I know what ima tell her
The same thing that the bankrobber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag
Thats the way it suppose to be
A real nigga posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic its safer to ask it
So dent that nigga I will pay for the casket
That remy ma got him spittin plenty bars
Broke ass nigga couldnt buy the mini bar
So get with loso
he aint got to no so
Such a gentlement dozen bottles of that rose mo
Oh you gotta men well u need a wit-u-one
meat me in the parking lot the place ade get u one
Meet me at the register
Im there on the regular
These niggas price checkin

As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we bringin down the weed
Just throw it in the bag


Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
