I was just coasting away
And wasn't even thinkin of anybody no
You took my mind sexy no doubt
Envisionung turning u out
And then we caught eyes ain't no stoppin now
Burn some candlelight incence
Taste of berry wine
Just me and you and all i wanna do
Is get with you
One night it could be so real
If you give me a chance baby
I want to show you romance baby


If you feel me
Cool relax let your mind lay back
Lace your mind like a love affair
Cool relax let your mind lay back
Let me know how you're felling girl

Now you don't know what to say
You see that I seem
to be staring at your body
Oh yeah, and just before
you could speak out
I put one finger over your mouth
I dont mean to be jock'n
But baby can I see you tonight
Until the break of day
We can't leave until you say
It's just me and you
All I want to do is get with you
One night it could be so real
If you just give me a chance baby
I wanna show u romance lady


If you feel me
Cool relax let your mind lay back
Lace your mind like a love affair
Cool relax let your mind lay back
Let me know how you're felling girl
