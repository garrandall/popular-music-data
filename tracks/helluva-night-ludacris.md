Come join the rocks it's my drink night
So I'm ready to party, yeah get down
I'm a vip and we so elite now
Pick you up in a convertible, let's meet now
Anybody wanna rumble in the streets now
All the  jump up to get beat down
Helluva night we going with no sleep no
Madcon and Ludacris, let's sing now

I can't believe my eyes, I'm jumped up surprise, oh my lord
You're anything that average, it's Â in your eyes
I wonder who you are in, I lost control
I'm ready to come grab it
It's Â I must take the chance
You Â run of me, so I grab your hand
Baby let's ride, ride
Girl we riding through the sunset
I never realized, I never knew I had to, my lord
You got the gutsÂ and you my next chapter, realize
I know you wanna do, Â look in your eyes
I rise a few feet, need to know
Cause I Â you mean, you and I, I, I, I, I
Come on and go, I, I, I

Hey girl, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night

Hey boy, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night


You, you and I, setting the place on fire
Oh, oh, so fine, we rock the base all night
You hot, hot, hot
We about to get, down, down, down
So you can hit them high
Or you can hit them low
Jump up to get down, so we can get low
Hey girl, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night

Hey boy, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night

Yeah, we having a helluva night now
And the club is ready to ignite now
Don't stop, just tell them to get high now
And that incredible body I want it right now
Seeing you was such a beautiful sight now
Let me set the mood and turn the lights down
I wanna pick you up and lay you right down
And I hope you ready to take flight now
Cause Ludacris lay the pipe down
Keep it tight now, hey girl, night night now

Hey girl, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night

Hey boy, lets turn the club out
You and me getting down
Dj turn it loud, we having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
We having one helluva night
