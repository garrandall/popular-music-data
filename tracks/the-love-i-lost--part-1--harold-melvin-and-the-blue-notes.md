The love I lost
Was a sweet love
The love I lost
Was complete love
The love I lost
I will never no no never
Love again oh

I can remember planning
Building my whole world around you
And I can remember hoping
That you and I could make it on through
But something went wrong
We loved each other
We just couldn't get along
Take a good look at me
I'm in misery, can't you see

The love I lost (the love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love (yes it was)
The love I lost (the love, the love I lost)
Was complete love
The love I lost
I will never no no never
Love again

I can't remember nothing, no no no
But the good times we used to share (my love)
I'm so sad and lonely
But without you my life is so dead
I'm sorry to say
You go your way and I'll go my way
It hurts deep inside
The day we said goodbye, but


The love I lost (the love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love (yes it was)
The love I lost
Was complete love
The love I lost
I will never (never) no no never
(Never) love again (I'll never love again)

I will never (never) no no never
(Never) love again ohoohhohoh
I will never (never) no no never
(Never) love again

Never (never) no no never
