The summer air was heavy and sweet
You and I on a crowded street
There was music everywhere, I can see us there
In a happy little foreign town
Where the stars hung upside down
A half a world away, far, far away

I remember you were laughing
We were so in love, we were so in love


And the band played 
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh la la la la la la la la 
And we danced anyway

Well they say you can't go back
But baby I don't believe that
Come along with me, come on and dance with me
Well maybe if I hold you close
Baby we could just let go
Of these things that tie us down, we'll come back around

You remember we were laughing
We were so in love, so in love



You remember we were laughing
We were so in love, we were so in love

And the band played 
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh la la la la la la la la 
La la la of the world
Ohhhhhh
And we dance anyway (oohh we were laughing ohh)
Ohhhh
And we danced anyway
(ohh we were dancing ohh)
