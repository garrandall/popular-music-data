When I see my baby
What do I see
Poetry
Poetry in motion

Poetry in motion, walking by my side, her lovely locomotion
Keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway, a wave out on the ocean, could never move that way

I love every movement, and there's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement, she's much too nice to rearrange

Poetry in motion, dancin' close to me, a power of the devotion, swaying gracefully
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway, a wave out on the
Ocean, could never move that way

I love every movement, and there's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement, she's much too nice to be arranged
Poetry in motion, dancin' close to me, a power of the devotion, swaying gracefully
