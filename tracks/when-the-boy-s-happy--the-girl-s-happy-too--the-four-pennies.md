Every day, I kiss my baby
Just because it drives him crazy

And I will do most anything
To make him feel just like a king
Cause when the boy's happy
The girl's happy too

I say I love him when I hold him
Heaven knows how much I've told him

I always treat him tenderly
Because he means the world to me
Cause when the boy's happy
The girl's happy too

I know how to break him up
I know how to make him care
I know how to shake him up
I just run my fingers through his hair

I could never live without him
That is why I worry about him

He comes to me
Cause he knows that I'll
Do all the things that'll make him smile
Cause when the boy's happy
The girl's happy too

Yeah, when the boy's happy
The girl's happy too, oh yeah...
