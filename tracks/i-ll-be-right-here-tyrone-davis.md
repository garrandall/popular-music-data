I'll be right here, holding on to you
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I'll be right here, holding on to you, baby
When all of your friends are gone

When old man trouble call
Then we can just laugh it off
There'll be no need in running for cover
Cause, baby, we will have each other

Oh, I'll be right here
Holding on to to you, baby
When your little heart is in doubt
I'll be right here, holding on to you, baby
When you're feeling down and out

When things seems to get a little rough
And the going seems to get too tough
Baby, don't change your way
Cause you will have a love for days

Oh, yes, I will, yes, I will
I'll be right here, baby

When old man trouble call
Then we can just laugh it off
There'll be no need in running for cover
Cause, baby, we will have each other

Oh, baby, baby, baby
I love you so much, baby
I'll be right here

You don't have to
Worry bout it no more, baby
All you got to do is lean
On old T.D., baby...
