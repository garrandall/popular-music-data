He's a movie star, only drives rented cars
Met him in a bar, said, "I know who you are"
Took him to my party as the games were starting
Bottle's on the ground, are you ready now?

When it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready
It's my turn in a minute
Gonna put my message in it
Five minutes in the closet with you

He's in a bunch of movies, really stupid movies
It's not entirely his fault, he can't control it all
I am not afraid, I can hardly wait
Truth or dare, I don't care, tell the truth I dare you

When it comes around
When it comes around
When it comes around
When it comes around

Do you feel it too, what I feel for you?
If it was just us, would you do what I do?

Everybody's watching, everybody's looking
She's such a sucker, he don't want to fuck her
He is gonna kiss me, if he doesn't miss me
I am ready for it now, already on the ground

Five minutes in the closet with you
Oh, five minutes in the closet with you

Spin it round again
Spin it round again
Spin it round again
Spin it round again

Spin it round again
Spin it round again
Spin it round again
Spin it round again
