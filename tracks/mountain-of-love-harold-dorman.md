Mountain Of Love
Johnny Rivers

Original by writer Dorman hit # 21 in 1960
Ronnie Dove's version managed # 67 in 1968

Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops fallin' down a mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weepin' my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love, a mountain of love, you should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, my dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love



A mountain of love, a mountain of love, you should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' that shoulda been ours
>>>>That's why I'm so lonely,? from above
