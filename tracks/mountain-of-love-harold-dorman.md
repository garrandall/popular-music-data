Standin' on a mountain lookin' down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops fallin' down the mountain side
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were above
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I'm a-standin' here alone
Weepin' my heart out 'til the cold grey dawn
Hopin' that you're lonely and you'll come here too me
Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you somewhere here above
High on a mountain of love

Mountain of love, mountain of love
You should be ashamed
Used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a great tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, here up above
High on a mountain of love

Mountain of love, mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a greet tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, here up above
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
On a mountain of love
