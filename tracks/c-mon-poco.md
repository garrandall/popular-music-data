(richie furay)

I don't sing no songs to make you sad
Only ones to love me
Every now and then again
If you're feeling down and lonely
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and love me

Ain't it downright sad at times
When your love's been mistaken
There's no one left, no one's around
Only your heart breaking
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and love me

I believe that you and I as men
Should love one and another
Satiesfied, have a peace of mind
Love your neighbour as your brother
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and love me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and love me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon and love me
