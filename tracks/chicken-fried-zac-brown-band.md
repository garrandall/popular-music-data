Uh ha, you thought we were done, huh? Ha-ha-ha, we got more!

Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry

My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard
(That's right)
He's a mean son' bitch
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar

Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry

I heard this awful noise coming from the woods
(Coming from the woods)
I heard chicken screams
Know it wasn't gonna be good

I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken because I just heard him cry
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken but you can get another one for a dollar 79

Over a couple of years his spurs have grown
He wasn't safe to keep around the home
And he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son
And I was in the kitchen making fig preserves
And I heard that youngin get kicked in the face
And I knew 'twas the day that that rooster's gonna get what he deserves

So I chased the chicken
I chased a chicken
I chased a chicken and Pete hit 'em from the side
I chased a chicken
I chased a chicken
Me and Pete suppered on a home-made chicken pot pie

That's awesome

Well, sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time

You're damn right I like my chicken fried... Yeah
