The timing is set
As the lead takes her hand
The makeup is wet
As the gallery stands
The air is alive
And the city awaits
The air is alive
And the city awaits
Oh, under the stars
The canvas has dropped
At the back of the stage
The music is soft
As crescendos await
The air is alive
And the city is waiting
The air is alive
And the city is waiting
Oh, under the stars
The world is a show
Yes, it's always the same
The ending we know
But that's not why we came
The air is alive
And the city is waiting
The moment's arrived
And the angels are shaking
Oh, under the stars
With every name
There is nothing new under the sun
No, it's always the same
Yes, this world will go on
It's always competing
Yes, the show will go on
It's always repeating
Oh, the characters play
And the hero will sing our song
As machines raise the gap
The show goes on
And the people are waiting
The moment's arrived
The angels are shaking
Oh, under the stars
I believe in love that will live through the age
I believe that the world is a stage
I believe in a love that will live through the age
I believe that the world is a stage
Oh!
