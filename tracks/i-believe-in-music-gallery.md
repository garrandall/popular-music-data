I could just sit around
Making music all day long
As long as I'm makin' my music
Ain't gonna do nobody no harm
And who knows maybe
I'll come up with a song
And make people wanna stop
All their fussin' and fightin'
Long enough to sing along

I, I believe in music
Whoa, oh I, I believe in love
I, I believe in music
Whoa, I, I believe in love

Music is love and love is music
If you know what I mean
People who believe in music
Are the happiest people I've ever seen

So clap your hands and stomp your feet
And shake your tambourine
Lift your voices to the sky
Tell me what you see, hey

I, I believe in music
Whoa, oh I, I believe in love
I, I believe in music
Whoa, I, I believe in love

Music is the universal language
And love is the key
To peace, hope and understandin'
And livin' in harmony

So grab your brother by the hand
And sing along with me
And lift your voices to the sky
Tell me what you see

I, I believe in music
Whoa, oh I, I believe in love
I, I believe in music
Whoa, I, I believe in love
