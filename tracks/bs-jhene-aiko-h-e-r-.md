Yeah
Yeah
Uh
Back up on my b—
Done dealing with you
Yeah


Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back


It seem like I give so much and don't get nothin' back
I really thought it was love but you're so fuckin' whack
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that
I can't get caught up in lust, so now I'm—, yeah
Flexin' on my exes, in my model X
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose
I am on my own now, I am in control now
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown


Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)


Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways
Might just see him for the weekend, you say that's a cold play
I be feelin' triggered, I don't know how to let it go
Really you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional, hey (Hey)
Puttin' me through it
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it
He be comin' through with it
And I hope you cool with it
I just met your roommate, put him on my to-do list
Doin' me
Back up on some new shit, everything in between
I'm out here, I'm gettin' stupid
I'm done bein' exclusive and—
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless
I'm back on my—


Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Out here actin' foolish, like I'm seventeen
I just bought a new whip, don't need gasoline (Yeah)
I just seen your new bitch, it boost my self-esteem (Oh babe)
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)


Flex on my ex, in my model X
Flex on my ex, in my model X
Flex on my—, flex on my—
Flex on my—
You know I'm
Back up on my bullshit
I'm back up on the scene
Oh-oh-oh
Done dealing with you, so I'm back
