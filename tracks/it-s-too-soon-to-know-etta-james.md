Does he love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so?

And is he fooling?
Is this all a game?
Am I the fire or
Just another flame?

A one sided love
Would break my heart
He may be just acting
And playing a part

If he don't love me
Let him tell me so
And I, I can't hold him
If he wants to go

And though, though
I'll cry when he's gone
And I won't die and I'll live on
If it's so, it's too soon
Way too soon to know

Does he love me?
Can I believe him?

And though, I'll cry
Though, I'll cry when he's gone
And I won't die and I'll live on
If it's so, it's too soon
Way too soon to know
