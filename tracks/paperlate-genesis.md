Paperlate paperlate
Paperlate paperlate

Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but there is no one on the line
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news

Oh it's too easy to live like clockwork
Tick tock watching the world go by
Any change would take too long
So dry your eyes
Oh it's too easy to live in a cold sweat
Just sitting dripping in pools below
You can wipe your face
Kill the pain
But the fever won't go, no no

Paperlate
Pull it together now
Put your feet back on the ground
Paperlate
Oh don't worry now
You're not alone
Look around you
Paperlate
Oh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line
Paperlate
Oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news

Oh it's too easy to compute your future
Taking no risks and playing too safe
Any change would take too long
So dry your eyes
Oh it's too easy to talk about rocking the boat
Making changes and changing track
But you'd better not lock that door
Cos you'll be coming back

Ah you're breathing faster
Silence the only sound
There's no need to be nice on the way up
Cos you're not coming down

Paperlate paperlate
Paperlate paperlate
Paperlate paperlate
Paperlate paperlate

Paperlate
Oh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line
Paperlate
Oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news...
