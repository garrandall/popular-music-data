As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love
In a world of our own

As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love
So much in love
So in love

So much in love

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch

When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together 'til we die
So much love have we two
Just can't wait to say "I do"
So in love
Are you and I
So in love
Are you and I
