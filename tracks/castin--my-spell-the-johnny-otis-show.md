I took a black cat, a cave bat
Threw them in the pot-pot pot-pot pot-pot-pot
I took a blue snake, a green snake
And tied them in a knot-knot knot-knot knot-knot-knot
I took a hogs jog, a dogs bog
And hung them on the line-line line-line line-line-line
I took a horse hair, a green pair
And made a crazy sign-sign sign-sign sign-sign-sign

I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
You'll never ever be untrue

I took a goats tooth an old shoe
And put them in the ground-ground ground-ground ground-ground-ground
I took an old dish a dry fish
And made a crazy sound-sound sound-sound sound-sound-sound
I took a goose egg, a frog's leg
And hid them in a sack-sack sack-sack sack-sack-sack
I got a Hindu to tattoo
A genie on my back-back back-back back-back-back

I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
You'll never never be untrue

I took a black cat, a cave bat
Threw them in the pot-pot pot-pot pot-pot-pot
I took a blue snake, a green snake
And tied them in a knot-knot knot-knot knot-knot-knot
I took a hogs jog, a dogs bog
And hung them on the line-line line-line line-line-line
I took a horse hair, a green pair
And made a crazy sign-sign sign-sign sign-sign-sign

I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
I'm casting my spell on you
You'll never never be untrue
You'll never never be untrue
You'll never never be untrue
You'll never never be untrue
You'll never never be untrue
