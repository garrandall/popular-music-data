When you need a friend
Someone you can lean on
Who will understand
Understand your problems
When you need a lover, woo
Someone who will satisfy
Don't you call no other, no no
Just call me anytime


I'll be there to fulfill your every need


If you want a man
Strong but sensitive
(Oh, baby)
Anything you need
I'll be willing to give
Every day and night
I will treat you right
You need an all true man
(I'm a man, I'm a man)

I'm an all true man


When you need to cry
I'll be there to dry your eyes
You don't have to suffer no more

'Cause the secret to being complete
In your love life
If you're an all true woman
You need an all true man, yeah

I'm a man, baby
Taking care of my woman, girl
Go to work each day for the work that you could play
I got to be the man I'm supposed to be
Oh, true woman, yes
Oh, I'm the man, baby
True woman, so sweet
I'm an all true man
Let'me say it again
(All true man)
Let me say it again, I'm an all true man
If you know you need it, yeah baby
Woman, sugar, yes
