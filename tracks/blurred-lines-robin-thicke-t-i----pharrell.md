Everybody get up
Everybody get up


If you can't hear what I'm tryna say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind


Everybody get up


OK, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl


I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic alright
Talk about getting blasted

I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl

The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me


Everybody get up


What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
You the hottest bitch in this place

I feel so lucky,
You wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me?


Everybody get up


OK, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature

Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl


I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl

Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines (I hate them lines)
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl (good girl)

The way you grab me
Hustle gang homie
Must wanna get nasty
Leggo a say brah
Go ahead, get at me


Everybody get up


One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass to
Come on from Malibu to Paris boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable


Everybody get up


In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'


Shake your rump
Get down, get up
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work


Baby, can you breathe
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur

No more pretending
'Cause now you're winning
Here's our beginning
I always wanted a good girl


I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl

Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic alright
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines


Everybody get up

I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl

The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me


Everybody get up


Everybody get up
Everybody get up
