There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father, he was a gamblin' man
Way down in New Orleans

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father, he was a gamblin' man
Way down in New Orleans

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Don't spend your life in sheer misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Don't spend your life
In the House of the Rising Sun
Don't, don't, don't spend your life
In the House of the Rising Sun
