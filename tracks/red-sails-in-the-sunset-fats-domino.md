Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one, home safely to me
She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you
Swift wings we must borrow, make straight for the shore, oh yeah
We'll marry tomorrow and you go sailing no more
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one, home safely to me
Oh yeah
We'll marry tomorrow and you go sailing no more
And red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one, home safely to me
