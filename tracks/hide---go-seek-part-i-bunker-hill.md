Say, man
Looky here, man
Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek
What say, let's get together
And play some hide and go seek
Let's go, let's play
Well, I love you
Love you, love you
Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me
You all hid (yeah)
If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
Are you ready (I'm not ready)
Aw, man, let's hide this time
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
Who all hid (yeah)
If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
Already hid, you better
Holler billy goat
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
Walk, don't jump to
The bottom of the well
Swam by the devil and he
I'm not gonna say that
Who all hid (yeah)
If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
Aw, man, will you put down
That thing you got in your hand
ANd find your hole and get in it
I'm gonna say this one more time
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
Who all hid (yeah)
If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
One potato, two potato
Three potato, four
All ain't ready
Better let me go
If you hid behind my pie
I'm gonna hit you
Right in the eye
Who all hid (yeah)
If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
Are you ready
(I'm still not ready)
Aw, man, looky here
I want you to find the
Tallest tree and climb up in it
And walk out on the limb and jump
And I hope that you fall
In the deepest hole
I mean listen
I'm gonna say this one more time
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
All ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)
Now I know you're
Ready this time, man
(I'm not ready) aw, man
