Gonna take my soul to town
Gonna set my spirit free
Gonna capture your heart
Right from the start
You belong to me

If we could fly on our love
We are two birds high above
Suspended by the magic bond
Of love itself

Only then I would send
The soulful word again
The word of love
We're certain of
The one you love

(Capture your heart)
I'm gonna capture your heart
(Capture your heart)
Right from the very start
(Capture your heart)
(Capture your heart)

You'll never run away from me
I got you covered, wait and see

I'm gonna capture your heart
Right from the start
I'm gonna capture your heart
You belong to me

I'm gonna capture your heart
Right from the start
I'm gonna capture your heart
You belong to me

I'm gonna capture your heart
Right from the start
I'm gonna capture your heart
You belong to me...
