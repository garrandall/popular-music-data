We were having such a good time, baby
Oh, yes, we were
Then you went and spoiled the whole thing, baby
In front of everyone

You're telling me I was wrong
And that all night long
I was staring at someone else
Well, even if you were right
There's no need to fight
There's no need to get upset


Don't you get so mad about it
(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it
(About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it
(Oh, oh oh
Don't you get so mad about it, hey
(Mad about it)


You should learn to control your feelings
Respectably
‘Cause arguing in public is embarrassing

It's always the same thing, baby
Accusing me out of jealousy
I never will understand
Why you make so much out such a little thing




It's all so crazy now
Somehow it's got to change
Take a look at yourself
Carrying on this way

I know you care about
The love we're building here
So why get all upset
It's just not worth it
Listen to me, my dear



(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad, baby
(About it, about it)
Whoa, whoa, ho, baby
(Oh, oh oh
Don't you get so mad about it
(Mad about it)
Whoa, ho, oh…

(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't get so mad now, baby
(About it, about it)
Ho, don't you get so mad about it, babe
Don't you get so mad
(Oh, oh oh
Don't you get so mad about it, babe, no
(Mad about it)
Woo, oh ho

(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't get so mad about it
(About it, about it)
There's no need to get upset
(Oh, oh oh
Darling, please don't forget the love we had
(Mad about it)
Oh…
