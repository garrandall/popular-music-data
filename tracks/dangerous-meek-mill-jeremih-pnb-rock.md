Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!


You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Oh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Oh, you give me something I can't pay for


No angel, but you got a halo
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there


It was nights like this, feeling right like this
I never really spent no time like this, uh
The second time at the crib knowing I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?", like my bitch, yeah
Looking in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
That pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, this strange as fuck
( That's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now
Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars, since they throwing all the shade on us
Facts


You feel the vibe, it's contagious

Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous

Grateful I had all the patience

I know you going through some changes

You taking pictures, know your angles

Oh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close

Oh, you give me something I can't pay for

That's what it's like loving you


Uh, you feel the vibe
Uh, I'm deep inside
Yeah, you fucking me
Oh, I let you ride
Yeah, at first you curved me
I let you slide then
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Oh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal, when we come through just like Beyonc√©, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rocking with a real one
And when I'm in it, you be maxin' on a million
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
I know them bitches hating on you, we gon' kill them
That's facts


You feel the vibe, it's contagious

Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous

Grateful I had all the patience

I know you going through some changes

You taking pictures, know your angles

Oh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close

Oh, you give me something I can't pay for

That's what it's like loving you


Ayy, you know you bad bad
You know I laugh at these shawty's that try to text back
You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options
Girl, you got me calling, all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leaving work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, that ass is so dangerous


You feel the vibe, it's contagious

Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous

Grateful I had all the patience

I know you going through some changes

You taking pictures, know your angles

Oh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close

Oh, you give me something I can't pay for

That's what it's like loving you
