I hadn't anyone till you
I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder
If there could be someone in the wide world
Just made for me
Now I see I had to save my love

I had to save my love for you
I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

(I had to save my love for you)
(I never gave my love till you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took it took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone, I hadn't anyone till you
