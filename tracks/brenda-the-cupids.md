Brenda, I love you
I do, I really do
Can't you see my love for you
Will never die, oh, Brenda
Brenda, I dream of you
Now and every night
Can't you see that I
Need your love, oh, Brenda
Brenda, Brenda...
Brenda, be mine
Now and every night
Can't you see that I
Need your love, oh, Brenda
Brenda, Brenda...
