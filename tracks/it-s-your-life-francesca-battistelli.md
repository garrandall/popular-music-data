This is the moment
It's on the line
Which way you gonna fall?
In the middle between
Wrong and right
But you know after all


It's your life
What you gonna do?
The world is watching you
Every day the choices you make
Say what you are and who
Your heart beats for
It's an open door
It's your life

Are you who you always said you would be?
With a sinking feeling in your chest
Always waiting for someone else to fix you
Tell me when did you forget



To live the way that you believe
This is your opportunity
To let your life be one that lights the way
