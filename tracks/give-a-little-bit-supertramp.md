Alright
Here we go again

Give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my love to you

There's so much that we need to share
So send a smile and show you care

Alright, alright

I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my life for you
So give a little bit
Oh, give a little bit of your time to me

See the man with the lonely eyes
Oh, take his hand, you'll be surprised

Oh, take it

Come along
Come on

Give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
I give a little bit
I give a little bit of my life for you

Now's the time that we need to share
So, find yourself, we're on our way back home

Going home
Don't you need, don't you need to feel at home?
Oh, yeah, we gotta see

You gotta get a feeling
You come along too

You can come along too, yeah
Come aâ, come aâ, come aâ, come along

Cha, cha, cha
Ooh, yeah, come along too
Yeah, come along too, yeah
Sing Betty Lou

Come along too
What a long ride
Come a long way
Ooh, sing it tonight
