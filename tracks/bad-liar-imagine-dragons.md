Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

It's been a loveless year, I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
I wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

All my dreams never mean one thing
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin' for
Oh, I've been askin' for problems
Problems, problems

I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darlin') for problems
Problems, problems

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
I wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me
