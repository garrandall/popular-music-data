She said hello to me
And smiled so tenderly
And asked me what's my name


And she wore
Petticoat white and summer sky blue
The sweetest little thing I ever ever knew
Petticoat white and summer sky blue
The sweetest little thing I ever knew

I never will forget the early years
The way we shared the laughter and the tears
And our first precious kiss
Oh, how I'd come to this
When she moved away



Someday, I'll marry and I'll settle down
I'll see my girl there in her wedding gown
It will recall to me
Our childhood memory
As she walks down the aisle

'Cause she'll wear
Petticoat white and summer sky blue
The sweetest little thing I ever ever knew
Petticoat white and summer sky blue
The sweetest little thing I ever knew

'Cause she wore
Petticoat white and summer sky blue
The sweetest little thing I ever ever knew
