Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up
And how do we spend our lives if there's no-one to lend us a hand

I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life, Quietly fading away

Games people play, You take it or you leave it
Things that they say, Honor Brite
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars, Would you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night

Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn

I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life, Quietly fading away

Games people play, You take it or leave it
Things that they say, Just don't make it right
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now, do you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play, You take it or you leave it
Things that they say, Honor Brite
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars, Would you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play, You take it or leave it
Things that they say, Just don't make it right
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now, do you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night
