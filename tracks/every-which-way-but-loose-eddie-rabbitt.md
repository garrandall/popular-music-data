I've always been the kind of man
Who doesn't believe in strings
Long term obligations are just unnecessary things
But girl, ya got me thinkin'
While I'm drinkin' one more beer
If I'm headed for a heartache
Then why the hell am I still here

I'm testin' my resistance
And it's wearin' mighty thin
I've got the feelin' I should leave
Before the roof caves in
My mind tells me to move along
But my body begs me stay
And now I feel the need to hold you close
And love the night away
While you're turnin' me

Every which way but loose
You turn me
Every which way but loose
Inside the fire's burnin' me
In my mind you just keep turnin' me
Every which but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way but loose

When the sun comes up in the mornin'
It should find me some place new
But right this minute all I want
Is to lay here next to you
Those memories still keep callin' me
From somewhere in my past
Better hurry if they want me
'Cause I can feel me fadin' fast
While you're turnin' me

Every which way but loose
You turn me
Every which way but loose
Inside the fire's burnin' me
In my mind you just keep turnin' me
Every which but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way but loose
