Hey how you doin' lil' mama let me whisper in ya ear
Tell ya somethin' that ya might like to hear
Got a sexy ass body and ya ass look soft
Mind if I touch it to see if it's soft
Nah, I’m just playin' ‘less you say I can
And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So I don't mind askin' fo' head
Ya heard what I said
We need to make our way to the bed
You can start usin' ya head
Ya like to fuck, have ya legs open all in the buck
Do it up, slappin' ass, gurl the sex get rough
Switch position and let the dick get down to business
So you can see what you been missin'
You might had some, but you never had none like this
Just wait til' you see my dick (Oooooooo!)


Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
Wait til' you see my dick
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
I'm a beat that pussy up
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
Wait til' you see my dick
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
I'm a beat that pussy up
Like B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
Beat the pussy up, beat the pussy up
Beat the pussy up, beat the pussy up
Beat the pussy up, beat the pussy up
Beat the pussy up, beat the pussy up
(Oooooooo!)


You fine, but I ain't gone sweat ya
See I wanna fuck, tell me what's up
Walk around the club with ya thumb in ya mouth
Put my dick in, take ya thumb out
That my be a lil' kosher to deal wit
Wet fat hoes, they don't spill shit
I keep a ho hot when I'm puttin' in work
Ya wanna skeet, skeet ya bout to get ya feelins hurt
Cause I beat that cat with a dog
And knock the walls off a broad til' she squall
Like (Ooooooooo!)
Yeah, it's on like that
But it depend on the swing of the baseball bat
Fuck the bitch on the counter and make the plates fall back
On the floor she ain't stealin' cause she nut so they crack
Crack, crack, fuck that bend over I'm a give ya ass my bat
(Ooooooooo!)


Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
Wait til' you see my dick
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
I'm a beat that pussy up
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
Wait til' you see my dick
Hey bitch, wait til' you see my dick
I'm a beat that pussy up
Like B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
B-AM, B-AM, B-AM, B-AM
