Take this good ass thuggin and help the nice dick,
Im icey lik Gouchie,

Go On in the pussy I dont fuck wit the booty,
When im in the bed still carrey my tooly
Do the Paris Hilton and make a porno movie
Im groovy, like muthafuckin Austin,
Look at all the D bras and draws as im droppin 


This is the wait remix,

Cuz u couldn't get enough,
Like Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam,
Couldnt Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,

Yo Free


Hey how ya doing little dirty
Let me whisper in ya ear
Tell ya some shyt you might like to hear
Got a nice little pu$$y
And my ass poke out
Automatically, I can ride a dick, no doubt
I'm known for getting all the haters mad
I can go slow but go crazy fast
I give amazing head
Backside a lil softer than a baby's ass
Now that's wild soft
I'll let a rich n!gga hit it on his golf course
I got a young dude open, that was my fault
I let him see me in my bra and my boy shorts
Now for the freaks in here, it's the remix
Puttin' down with the Ying Yang Twins
Last night I fell in love with an O.G.
He crept up on me
And this what he told me
He said


This is the wait remix,
This is the wait remix,
Hey Girl,
This is the wait remix,
Cuz u couldn't get enough,
Like Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam,
Couldnt Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Bussa Buss Baby
Let me holla at ya Shorty


Before I put my cup on yo ass,
You lookin I could park my truck on yo ass,
Shorty you should go ahead and clap that shit,
With yo big ass makin me wanna slap that shit,
You know what jump in my ride and lets slide,
Ima beat up the puddy and cook it with a fish filet fry,
Now its time to make you open wide,
Like A diamond fuck like you aint got no pride,
I love it hard,
I take you and alana outside,
Fuck u off the edge of the bed landslide, dats right,
The way u freaky I wanna hangglide,
All on ur edge you tryin to give me head in my Roush,
Shhh, Wait, chill, shhh, quiet,
Let me finish tellin u wats goin on, okay,
The way u like to do it we can fuck to the song and Ima beat the pussy up till its time to get gone,
And before I can end, wat I was sayin she was tryin to put me onto to her friend,
I told her bring her,
Im warning you I once that said,
Wait til the both of you see my dick.


This is the wait remix,
This is the wait remix,
Hey Girl,

Cuz u couldn't get enough,
Like Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baaam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam, Baam,
Couldnt Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,
Couldn't Get Enough,


When I get up on the track ima talk a lot a shit,
Been a around the world I been seen plenty dicks,
Small ones, medium, grande baby,
One minute, two minute, no way baby,
Eat the nookie up, or eat the cookie,
I put the sugar on his tounge and that a shut em up,
I take my clothes down like its goin down, like a show down,
Show him I can go for 12 rounds on the cold ground,
Hey nigga let me slow it down,
Like a striper on the pole I can role it round,
Now who that there wanna tear da nookie up,
You betta pull out ya cash and put more then 50 up,
Cuz this here chick aint gonna let u beat it up, you betta pull out ya cash and more then 50 up,
Wait till u taste my,
Wait till u taste my, 
Wait till u taste my,
Wait till u taste my,
U gonna love this good stuff!
