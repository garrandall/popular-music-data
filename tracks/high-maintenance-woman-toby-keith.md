I see her layin' by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say



She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex



And she'll go out dancin' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limosine
I know where she's goin'
She's goin' downtown
I'm goin' downtown, too, and take a look around



See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm tryin' hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man



I'm just sittin' 'round waitin' on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waitin'
And he'll be right there



Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's gettin' clogged up or maybe startin' to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy



See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man...man



See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm tryin' hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man...no
