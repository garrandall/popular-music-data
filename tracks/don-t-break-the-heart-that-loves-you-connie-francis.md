(Don't break the heart that loves you so)

Don't break the heart that loves you
Handle it with care
Don't break the heart that needs you
Darling, please be fair

Why do you flirt and constantly hurt me?
Why do you treat our love so carelessly?

You know I'm jealous of you
And yet you seem to try
To go out of your way
To be unkind

Sweetheart, I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine

Darling, please don't hurt me
Please, don't make me cry
I don't know what I'd do if you'd ever say goodbye
Remember, I love you so much
And love is life's greatest joy
Please don't break my heart like a child breaks a little toy

Sweetheart, I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine
