In the time of chimpanzees
I was a monkey
Butane in my veins
And I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs,
Spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights
And put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser
And the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches,
Sleep on the love seat
Someone keeps saying
I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding
And a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation
And a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face
With some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning down the trailer park

(Yo. Cut it.)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

(Double-barrel buckshot)

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel
And the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows
And the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
Slab of turkey-neck
And it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat
For the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax
Falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the Cheeze Whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body-pierce)

(Yo, bring it on down)
Soy

(I'm a driver; I'm the winner;
Things are gonna change
I can feel it)

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie Deutsch, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Know what I'm saying?)
