Gone, the voice that used to fill the room is all but gone
An echo of a perfect love that ended wrong
Girl, we tried so hard when love was on our side
And yesterday will always be the reason why

You keep comin'
You keep comin' back
You keep comin' back for more

I'll see you in my dreams
There we'll be safe tonight from the lonely days of memory
I'll see you in my dreams, oh

Time, time will never be a friend of mine again
It tries to make your memory fade, but I won't let it end
Let the sun go down, so I can drift away
Let me close my eyes and live another day

You keep comin'
You keep comin' back
You keep comin' back for more

I'll see you in my dreams
There we'll be safe tonight from the lonely days of memory
I'll see you in my dreams, oh

The truth, oh it's there for you to see
Sometimes it's painful to be on your own, on your own

I'll see you in my dreams
There we'll be safe tonight from the lonely days of memory
I'll see you in my dreams
Back in my arms again and no matter what tomorrow brings
I'll see you in my dreams
Oh, oh, oh
