Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
I remember all I wanted in a lover
Was just a pretty face but all I found were hearts of stone
Spent a lifetime
On the road to nowhere till I found my way back home
You gave me shelter from the cold and the rain - whoa and
Now I know pleasure where there used to be pain

Chorus:
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
You saved me with warmth and understanding
You're everything that I could ever want
And after so long we're standing here together
And forever we'll live on
In time most other loves just wither and fade, I tell ya
Ours just gets stronger each and every day
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Hey-come over here for a second...
I got something I wanna say...
Even though I may not think to tell you every day...
Ooh - I'm so happy you're still mine!
Oh, you came along with a love so sweet, took me by surprise
Knocked me off my feet
You still send shivers up and down my spine
Oh I gotta be the luckiest man alive
Repeat Chorus
