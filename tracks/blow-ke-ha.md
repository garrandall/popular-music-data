BLOWWWW BLOOOWWWW


Just while then
Shades on my face
Eyes on my kicks
Lights on my face
Speakers gon' blow
Speakers got bass
Bottles on ice
Haters gon' hate
Baller don't care
Baller's so straight
Baller from the hood
So Baller don't play
Baller burn good
What they prolly gon' say
Sicker than the stuff like raviole
So bon appetite
Just got a sipper
Blow like a missile
White clef cush
I've been going to november
Where the grand gripper
Word to manila
You better remember, I'm from the city
Where the shortys and players live
Nice stars out at the ATL
And prolly won't end til 8am
Yeah I'm an ATLien
An extraterrestrial, asses with the vegetable
Up in the air and no parachute
I ain't contested the best in the area
Even the vision of pair, one can tell
Tha you can see Where I'm coming from
And leave all when I'm done
Haters miss me with a bunch joke
Cuz this place's about to blow
I can push stroke here
And ninety feet like a bunch of drunk
Let's go!

WE'RE TAKING OVER...DANCE


Back door cracked
We don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze

Drink that Kool-Aid
Follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights
And shut the DJ down
(This place about to)
Tonight were taking over
No one's getting out

This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to

Now what (What)
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't

Dirt and glitter
Cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored (Ha)

It's time to lose your mind
And let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking names
'Cause we don't mess around

This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to

(Blow)

Go, go, go, go insane
Go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

Go insane
Go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes (C'mon)

We are taking, over (Blow)
Get used to it, over (Blow)

This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow (Oh)
This place about to blow (Oh)
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to
