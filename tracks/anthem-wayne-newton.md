We used to pray for folks far away
For  working a rain
For  ending the war
For people from the past that we miss
Now our only prayer is this

Let  my momma get home from shopping
Without  her groceries scattered all over the parking lot
With a gun at her throat
Just  some dirt on her coat

Let my daddy get back from work without any incident
Lord let  his home is still be his castle
And I pray the lord now

We  used to pray for folks far away
For working a rain
For ending the war
For people from the past that we miss
Now our only prayer is this

Let my woman be safe in the house without a voiceless breather
On the telephone to frighten her when she's there all alone
Let my kids get home from school wise and well aware
Of someone waiting there to tempt them with his candy
And I pray to the lord now

We used to pray for folks far away
For working a rain
For ending the war
For people from the past that we miss
Now our only prayer is this

The decency we strive for
Fight and stay alive for
It's the people that we care for
Isn't that what we're here for

We used to pray for folks far away
For working a rain
For ending the war
For people from the past that we miss
Now our only prayer is this

We used to pray for folks far away
For working a rain
For ending the war
For people from the past that we miss
Now our only prayer is this
