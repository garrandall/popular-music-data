You ain't fooling me
Huh, huh, no, well
Well, well, yeah, ah, ah, ah

Acting needy
Loving money being greedy
(Yeah, yeah)

And you're lying
Oh cheating
You've got me crying
Oh baby girl

And you're taking (taking)
Giving nothing but shaking
(Shaking, shaking, shaking ain't nothing shaking baby)

And you're faking (faking)
Your love
My heart is breaking, oh, yeah

(CHORUS)
Now tell me who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
You're fooling you
You're fooling you (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you (You're fooling you) oh, oh

Ah, you're skipping (ah you're moving)
All around me and you're scheming
You must think I'm dreaming
Ah you breaking
You just just keep on shaking

And you're lazy (just like Susan)
Don't do nothing, you must be crazy
If you think I'm gonna be slaving
(Slaving, slaving, slaving) huh
While you're playing

(CHORUS)
Ah tell me who's fooling who

You ain't fooling me
You're fooling you
You're fooling you (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you, hey, hey, hey, hey

(CHORUS)
You're acting needy
But you're kinda greedy
Ain't gonna be slaving
No, not while you're playing, oh
(You might think I'm dreaming)
Tell, Tell me who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me, no
I'm fooling you

(CHORUS)
You're fooling you (Who's fooling who)
You're fooling you (You ain't fooling me)
You ain't fooling me (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you, you, yea baby

Who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
You thought you had me
I'm fooling you

You're fooling you (Who's fooling who)
You're fooling you (You ain't fooling me)
You ain't fooling me (You're fooling you)
You ain't fooling me, me, yeah, yeah

Who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
Nah, nah, naw, I'm fooling you

(CHORUS)
You're fooling you (Who's fooling who)
You're fooling you (You ain't fooling me)
You fooling you, (You're fooling you)
You're fooling you, you, you
