Both: That special tear I shed means you're a part of me
Thoughts of you running through my head mean you're a part of me
Yeah, I'm satisfied to know you're a part of me
Marvin: What I want to say is
Diana: All I want to say is
Both: That I love you ‘cause you're that very special part of me
Marvin: Oh oh baby
Diana: Anytime you look into my eyes (Eyes, baby)
Can't you see what you mean to me (talk to me)
And every time you hear me speak your name (oh oh oh baby)
Can't you tell what you mean to me (ah mercy)
Both: Wohoh hey, you can't move the moon, you can't stop the passing time
Ain't it plain by now you can't move this love of mine
Just as simple as a nursery rhyme
Marvin: What I want to say is
Diana: All I want to say is
Both: That I love you ‘cause you're that very special part of me
Marvin: Oh when the morning comes I wipe the sleep from my eyes
Well I can't walk away from what I feel inside
Both: Can't find the cure for not having you around (sugar)
Marvin: Oh I've searched far and near ah
But the cure just can't be found no no no
Both: That special cure just out of reach means you're a special part of me
That special cure just out of reach means you're a special part of me
I'm satisfied to know that you're a part of me
Marvin: All I want to say hey hey hey is
Diana: All I want to say is
Both: That I love you ‘cause you're that very special, very special
I love you oh, how else can I explain, I love you ‘cause of that special thing
I love you every time I shed that special tear
I love you every time I feel that special thing for you
