The men in my little girl's life
The men in my little girl's life

It seems like only yesterday
When I heard my little girl say
Daddy, there's a boy ouside, his name is Rod
He wants to play in our backyard
Can he daddy
Can he daddy
Oh, please daddy

Is it really so long ago
She'd come to me and wanna know
Dad, there's a boy outside, his name is Lee
He wants to carry my books for me
Can he daddy
Is it alright, dad
He's got freckles, dad

The men in my little girl's life
The men in my little girl's life

Then came pony tails and jeans
And my little girl was in her teens
Popsie, there's a boy outside
His name is Tom
He wants to take me to the prom
OK, popsie
He's cute, popsie
We'll be home early, popsie

Before I knew it time had flown
And how my little girl had grown
Now it was, Father, there's a boy outside
His name is Eddie
He wants to know if we can go steady
Can we, father
Yes, father
Oh, can we borrow the car, pop

Yes it seems only yesterday
I heard my lovely daughter say
Dad, there's a boy outside
His name is Jim
He asked me if I'd marry him
I said yes, Dad
Got something in your eye, Dad
I love him, dad

The men in my little girl's life
The men in my little girl's life

A child, an adolescent, a young lady, a wife
And oh, yes
There's another man in my little girl's life
Hi dad, there's a boy outside
His name is Tim
I told him Grampa was gonna babysit him
Thanks, dad
Bless you, dad
Good night, dad

The men in my little girl's life
The men in my little girl's life
