I hold your hand and
Gently touch your hair
Then we'll walk
Together hand in hand
The way it used to be

The way you smile
And kiss me tenderly
Tears begin to fill my isty eyes
Now you'regone from me

Where are you going to, my love
Will you come back
When the sun shine
Anytime you want to
Come home,it'sall right
Where are you going to, my love
Will our love return tomorrow
Anytime you want to call me
It's all right

I hear you voice
It's always haunting me
Everywhere I turn
I see your face
But you're never there

You're all I have
(You're all I ever had)
You're all I'm living for
I can't bear the pain and misery
Please come back to me
