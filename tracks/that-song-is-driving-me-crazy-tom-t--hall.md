That song is driving me crazy I gotta hear it again
First time I heard it I was with some friends
It's a simple little song you can sing along with an old time melody
So would you play that crazy little song again for me
That song is driving me crazy...

I love that part about break my heart and baby please come home
And I love that line about hurtin' my mind and my beer ain't got no foam
That song is driving me crazy...

Well you'll sing high and I'll sing low and everybody sing along
But everybody quit while I get my kick singin' bring that boogie home
Mhm that song is a driving me crazy...
Okay gang well that song is driving me crazy...
That song is driving me crazy...
