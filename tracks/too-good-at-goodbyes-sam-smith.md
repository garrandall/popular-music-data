And every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance,
It's sad but it's true


How many heart breaks will it take for me to finally stay single?
That's the question I've been askin ever since I was little
When I met you didn't wanna get involved it was simple
But I wanted you so bad and you gave me all the signals
And then, 3 years later and look at us now
Having dinner at your parents and laughin it out
We was talking about having some kids in the house
But nothing ruins a relationship quicker than doubt
It's 3AM who the fuck is calling your phone?
If it's really your friend why did it come up unknown?
Askin you to come over and askin if you're alone
It's obvious I should've known...


And every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance,
It's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes


So why do I put up with this?
I call your phone at 2AM and you don't answer it
I've had enough of this girl I swear I'm done with this
It doesn't take a genius just to know you're up to shit
I remember everything you told me but everything was a lie
Told him that you were single but knew that you had a guy
Waitin for you at home thinkin everything was alright
But loyalty was never on your mind
I thought it was just me for you and you for me, that's the way it used to be
Guess I gotta blame myself for trusting you so stupidly
After all these years I never thought you would do this to me
But truthfully...


And every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance,
It's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes
No way that you'll see me cry
I'm way too good at goodbyes
No no no no no
No no noooo
No no no nonono no
And every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance,
It's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
