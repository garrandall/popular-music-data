If you are wonderin'
What I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin'
Am I sleepin', too?
Well I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes and lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you

I have been wonderin'
Just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin'
Had I not found you
I'd be outside findin' you
Walkin' on the avenue findin' you
But I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you

Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
She can't even get me up, on my feet
When I got to take care of some bus'ness on the street

I have been walkin'
All my streets alone
I would keep walkin'
To keep from goin' home
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
Now I can't conceive of ever leavin' you
'Cause I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you

I have been walkin'
All my streets alone
I could keep walkin'
To keep from going home
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
Now I can't conceive of ever leavin' you
'Cause I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you

I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you

I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you!
