Run through life's meadows, the rich green fields
Have yourself a hundred thrills

When you're ready to come home
I'll still love you

Go sing a song you long to sing
While you're gone, remember one thing
When you're ready to come home
I'll still love you

I was once somewhere along there myself
So I know how it feels
Like someone else
Doin' the things you want to do

Run through the rain, run through the sunshine
Once again, just bear in mind
When you're ready to come home
I'll still love you

(Instrumental)

I was once somewhere along there myself
So I know how it feels
Like someone else
Doin' the things you want to do

Oh Run through the rain, run through the sunshine
So once again, just bear in mind
When you're ready to come home
I'll still love you

Oh girl, when you're ready to come home
I'll still love you

(Instrumental to end)
