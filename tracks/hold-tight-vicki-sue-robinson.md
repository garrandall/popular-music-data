Hold tight
I wanna dance with you this whole night
I hope the music never slows up
I hope this place don't never close up

Hold tight
'Cause you're the only one who feels right
Girl I know it's now or never
I wanna dance with you forever

So hold on tight - never let me go, baby
'Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love
And when you get yourself in motion
Girl it's tearin' my emotions right in two

Hold tight
And we will dance into the moonlight
All the stars they will surround us
We will be so glad we found us

So hold on tight - never let me go, baby
'Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love
And when you get yourself in motion
I get lovin' notions all for you - yes I do

Hold tight
And we will dance into the moonlight
I hope the music never slows up
I hope tomorrow never shows up
