Yeah
Said it's all right
I won't forget
All the times I've waited patiently for you
And you'll do just what you choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight my dear


Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight my dear

Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight my dear
