Ooo oh
Ooo oh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
Let's make some romance
You know the night is fallin'
And the music's callin'
And we've got to get down to Swingtown

We've been workin' so hard
We've been workin' so hard
Come on baby
Come on baby let's dance
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Ooo oh
Ooo oh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
We may not get another chance
You know the night is fallin'
And the music's callin'
And we've got to get down to Swingtown
