Every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from heaven (from heaven)

Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven (from heaven)

You'll find your fortunes falling all over town
Make sure your umbrella is upside down (baby don’t you know)

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers

So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

(Every time it rains, it rains)
(Pennies from heaven)

(Don't you know each cloud contains)
(Pennies from heaven)

You'll find your fortunes falling all over town
Make sure that your umbrella (make sure your umbrella is upside down)
(Baby don’t you know)

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers

So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

(So take a big deep breath of the clean fresh air)
(Put a smile on your face, be a millionaire)
(The streets outside are paved with gold)
(There’ll be pennies from heaven)
(For you and for me)
