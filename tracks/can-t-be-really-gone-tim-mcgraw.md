Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind, it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So, she can't be really gone


The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waitin' in the hall
For her to slip them on
So, she can't be really gone


I don't know when she'll come back
She must intend to come back
And I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need
Just look around the room, so much of her remains


Her book is lying on the bed
The 'two of hearts' to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
At chapter 21
So, she can't be really gone


Just look around this room
So much of her remains


Her book is lying on the bed
The 'two of hearts' to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
With so much left undone
So, she can't be really gone
No, she can't be really gone
