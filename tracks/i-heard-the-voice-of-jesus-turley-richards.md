I heard the voice of Jesus say
"come on to me and rest"
Lay down thy weary
Weary one lay down
Lay thy head upon my breast

I went to Jesus as I was
I was weary, worn and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made me glad

Take my yoke upon you
And learn about me
For my yoke is easy
And my burdens are light
And my burdens are light

I heard the voice of Jesus say
"behold I freely give"
Oh, the living waters, oh thursty one
Stoop down and drink and live

I heard the voice of Jesus say
"come on to me and rest"
You've got to Lay down thy weary
Weary one lay down
Lay thy head upon my breast

I went to Jesus as I was
You know I was weary, worn and sad
I found in Him, yes I found in him a resting place
Oh, you know He's made... me glad

I heard the voice, yes of Jesus say
"behold I freely give"
Oh, the living waters, oh thursty one
Stoop down and drink and live

Oh I wonder, I wonder you could ever hear me?
I keep on calling, you've got to hear me
Oh, I'm pleading, everybody hear my plead
Oh, Jesus, hear my name, Oh Jesus
I said: "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"
I'm pleading, I'm pleading
You've got to hear me, yeah
You've got to hear me calling
I'm calling "Jesus", I keep calling
I said Yeah..., Jesus
I've just to keep on calling
Calling your name, I just call , I just call...
Yeah Yeah, You've got to hear me, hear me
Hear me, hear me calling, yes I did
You've got to hear me
I said Yeah..., Jesus Ahh...

You've got to hear me, Jesus
I keep calling, calling your name
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus
I'm calling, calling your name I keep on calling
Hold down my name
I pray, I pray....Yes, I'm praying
Jesus, hear my, hear my call...
