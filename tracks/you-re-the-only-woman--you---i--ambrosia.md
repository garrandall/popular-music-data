Oh baby
Say, now, you
You talk about The things I do
But baby, I yeah
I'll try 'n' explain the reasons why


'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout the things
That we said late last night
When every word I said
Just didn't come out right
And you were so afraid
That I'd found someone new
But darlin', well, there's no need
For what we're goin' through


Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love


Baby see, what a foolish heart has done for me
Darlin' why yeah, would you break my heart and make me cry?
Well now, you can't go back and change the way things are
And all this foolish talk won't take us very far
And so I hope you're list'nin' 'cause I'm tellin' you
About the, the way I feel and what I'm goin' through


Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love
I said you're the only woman that I really love
You're the only woman that I really love


Oh Don't speak, Ssssh …


When the pain of love surrounds you
And the world may be unkind
I'll put my lovin' arms around you
Take you far from this place and time


Because you and I been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman I’ve been dreamin' of
Baby, you're the only woman that I really love
You're the only woman
I know you're the only woman
Well now you're the only woman
