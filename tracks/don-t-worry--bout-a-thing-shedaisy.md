Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
And had it fall on your head
Well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles
Your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
Really gotta go - Oh no!

Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Ever sat yourself down when the
Seat is all wet
Or see your ex sucking face with
A little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
Best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
Bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!

Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah

Don't worry, don't worry

We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine

Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah

Don't worry, don't worry

Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
