I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

Here comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms remind me of the scent of your perfume
(Reminiscing the summer)
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny-dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here it doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Remember the nights when we closed our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time

Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

Here comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms remind me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny-dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here it doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart
(It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again
(I just wanna love again)
Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

Here comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
(When we used to kiss, baby)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms remind me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny-dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here it doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Remember the warmth of days gone by
