Biatch!
Eeeh, whappn no baby
You look good ina ya car eh
Longtime mi watch ya mi wha chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me
So whappn Dre tell em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh


Creeping down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, trying to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the C-P-T
On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another spot


Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4
With all the niggas saying


Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride


Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
(Uh, word to the motherfucking streets)
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah


Rolling in my 6-4
With all the bitches saying


Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the motherfucking bitches saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Know what I'm saying?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride


Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be


Rolling in my 6-4
With everybody saying


Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(With everybody saying)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
