Oh
Hey, come on in
Yeah, sit down make yourself comfortable
I was going to work the other morning
And these two chicks were on the bus, and they were
Running their mouths off about everybody's business
Yeah, you know how women are
Talk, talk, talk
Well then they were talking about my business, so I listened
Your name and my name came up
Yeah, they were saying things like
"Yeah, Margie ain't got a man tight no more
He'd been tippin' up town
And Marilyn's gonna take him from her if she don't look out"
Who's Marilyn?
I don't know who she is, you tell me who she is
They don't know what they're talking about
They seem pretty sure to me
Yeah, you know what?
They even mentioned the word love
Yeah, the word love
Well if you got so much respect for love
At least respect for our love
Then why don't you try proving it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well what you just do is


Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over (Think it over, baby baby)


Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
It's time you leave my door
I watch you walkin' down the street
Knowing your other love you're gonna to meet
This time before you run to her
Leavin' me all alone, alone to cry
Having her been sweet to you


Stop, in the name of love
(Before you break my heart)
(Stop it) Think it over baby
(Stop in the name of love) Think it over


Tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
It's time I see you, you and her together
Got it, baby baby babe
I'm afraid I'll be losing you forever
Stop it, baby


Stop in the name of love
Love love love love love love love love love love
(Stop in the name of love)
Gonna stop it baby, stop in the name of love
Yeah yeah yeah (Stop in the name of love)
Well well well well (Stop in the name of love)


(Stop in the name of love)
(Stop in the name of love)
(Stop in the name of love)
(Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it)
(Stop in the name of love)
(Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it)
(Stop in the name of love)
(Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it)
(Stop in the name of love)
