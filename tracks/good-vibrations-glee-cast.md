Yeah 
Can you feel it baby 
I can too 

Come on swing it  

1-2-3 - Now we come to the pay off 

It's such a good vibration 
It's such a sweet sensation  

Yo! It's about that time 
To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme 
I'm a get mine so get yours 
I wanna see sweat comin' out your pores 
On the house tip is how I'm swingin' this 
Strictly Hip-Hop boy, I ain't singin' this 
Bringing this to the entire nation 
Black, white, red, brown 
Feel the vibration 

Come on come on 
Feel it feel it 
Feel the vibration 


Vibrations good like Sunkist 
Many wanna know who done this 
Marky Mark and I'm here to move you 
Rhymes will groove you 
And I'm here to prove to you 
That we can party on the positiive side 
And pump posititve vibes 
So come along for the ride 
Making you feel the rhythm is my occupation 
So feel the vibration 

Come on come on 
Feel it feel it 
Feel the vibration 



Donnie D break it down 

Donnie D's on the back up 
Drug free, so put the crack up 
No need for speed 
I'm the anti D-R-U-G-G-I-E my 
Body is healthy 
My rhymes make me wealthy 
And the Funky Bunch helps me 
To bring you a show with no intoxication 
Come on feel the vibration 

Yeah 
Can you feel it baby 
I can too 



Now the time has come for you to get up 
The rest had you fed up but Yo, I won't let up 
On the rhythm and rhyme that's designed to 
Make your behind move to what I'm inclinced to 
Pure Hip Hop, no sell out 
If you ain't in it to win it 
Then get the hell out 
I command you to dance 
I wanna see motivation 
Come on now feel the vibration 



It's such a good vibration 
Come on come on come on 
It's such a sweet sensation 
Feel it feel it 





It's such a good vibration 
Come on come on come on 
It's such a sweet sensation 
Feel it feel it
