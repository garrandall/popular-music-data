Itâs a real bad time for black celebrities, they lockin everybody up: 

Michael Jackson, James Brown, Tupac, R. Kelly, OJ Simpson, Mike Tyson, 
Kobe Bryant, Jay-Z, Mystikal, P. Diddy, Allen Iverson, Snoop Dogg, DMX, 
Styles P, Shine, Beanie Segal, Lilâ Kim. 


Is it because Iâm Black 
Is it because Iâm Black 

When you black you got to hustle, got to struggle and strive. 
And not every cat that goes through that struggle survive. 
But he got to stay stronger and keep the struggle alive. 
They say the struggle died, I say the struggle revived. 
My profession is going through oppression. 
Thatâs why Iâm so stressed and Im working with no rest, 
and no question ima fight for yall cause I donât like it yall, 
we make half as much as them, we workin twice as hard yall. 
It aint fair sometimes you seein heaven signs, I aint Pharaohcon 
But I got knowledge and Iâm sharing mines. I swear its time to 
be aware that they fear you mind, and they fear your heart. You 
want to change heres the start. Iâm tired of watching cops outline 
my peers and yall, Iâm trying to make a move, Iâm not trying to make 
the news. They say the consequences worst when we break the 
rules. To get back and right you got to make a sacrifice. 


Is it because Iâm Black 
Is it because Iâm Black 

We got some problems we need solve, heres our chance to get them handle. 
Just take the boycott in Alabama for example. They stop ridin the bus till they 
address their affairs. And they ended segregation in less then a year. So imagine 
what our status if we made a contribution, weâll probably be able to change the 
constitution. I cant see no other kind of solution we deserve our reparation, its 
time for a revolutions. Iâm a step ahead of Satan, I read it in Revelation. Forget 
your reputation, lets make it a better nation, cause they trying to cage us in, 
make us slaves again, eventually its meant to be the new plantation, the penitentiary. 
For centuries they had a plan we let them executed, everyday another brother getting 
executed. And all our artist getting arrested I aspect improvement. Itâs a message 
in the music, I suggest you use it. 


Somebody tell me what can I do. 
Will I survive or will I die 

On the streets its hard to survive.
Why, is it because Iâm black,
Hot Shot got rock, I cant bring my cousin back.
Five-hundred thousand sold, gold, yeah it wasnât platinum,
but Clyde gave me another try, cause I wasnât whack.
And now im buzzin back, yeah I got my budget back.
Renegotiating got a mil to do a dozen tracks.
Yea Iâm eatin only reason is because I rap, my homies eatin only reason is because of crack.
They cant get a job so them niggas quick to rob, quick to steal,
quick to kill, grip the steal, quick to ride.
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King we cant forget them guys.
These politician, hypocrites they got us hypnotize.
That why I kiss rick, why, we got to lift our eyes.
Cause if we keepâem close they just goin keep control.
And hold our sisters and brothers in the pen and we was born guilty
cause the color of our skin.
