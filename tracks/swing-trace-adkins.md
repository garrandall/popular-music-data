take me out to the ball game 



Swing batter batter Swing batter batter Swing batter batter Swing 
Swing batter batter Swing batter batter Swing batter batter Swing 
(Strike one) 
Hey baby do you do come here often 
(Strike two) 
Hey baby now what's your sign 
(Strike three) 
Hold on now where you goin' 
(He is out) 
Jimmy's out next in line 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 



(First Base) 
Why yes I went to Harvard 
(SAFE) 
I majored in pre-med 
(He's got a big lead) 
(Picked off) 
Just stayed for one semester 
(It could be he's out) 
Toms out who's next 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing it now 



Everybody strikes out nine times out of ten 
But you got to step up to the plate son 'cause every now and then 
(Fast ball) 
She walked right up to me 
(Here's the pitch) 
Said could I take you home 
(Theirs a drive) 
Hey boys I'll see you later 
(It could be, it...it is!) 
Goin' goin' goin' gone 
(Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing)
