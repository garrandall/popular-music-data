Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would

I know it's hard on you
But like I always do

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy

Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
