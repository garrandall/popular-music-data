You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you, little darling, in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt-cure a ham
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

I've got a Jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little iPod's loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape-player hater, girl, we're groovin' to Hank

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can hot-wire your tractor and plow up your land
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

You like the Ivy League, Humvee, tennis sweater type
But, girl, I'm here to tell you don't believe the hype

Hey, I'm a country man
I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl, you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

Hey I'm a country man
Hunting me a good ol' country girlfriend
Why don't you come and join me in my new deer stand
Hey, baby, I'm a country man
Hey, baby, I'm a country man
