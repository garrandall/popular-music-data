Standing here helpless
Where do I go
If you leave me alone?
Where do I turn now
If it don't work out?

As far as I can see
This isn't the way
That you said it would be

Chorus:
Don't leave me like this
Don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now
You leave me empty-handed
Don't leave me like this
Don't leave me stranded

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me

Wasn't it you
Who brought me here
To the place lovers go?
Just look at these arms
Reaching out to you

Said that you'd always care
I just turn around
And there's nobody there

Chorus (1x)

Don't leave me now

You said that you'd always care
I just turn around
And there's nobody there

Don't leave me like --

Chorus (1x)

Stranded

Chorus (1x)

Stranded

Don't leave me like this
No, don't leave me
