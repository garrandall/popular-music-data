I want somebody to hold my hand
Somebody to love me and understand
I want a woman (woman)
I want a lover (a lover)
I want a friend (a woman, a lover, a friend)

Mmm, I want somebody to share my love
Yes, loving is something I've got plenty of
I want a woman (woman)
I want a lover (a lover)
I want a friend (a woman, a lover, a friend) ah-ah

I don't want a fancy gal
With powder and paint
And I don't want a woman

Who thinks she's a saint
I'm looking for someone
Who's not make-believe
And doesn't mind giving so that she may receive

There must be somebody somewhere around
That's looking for someone to give pound for pound
I want me a woman (woman)
Mmm, I want a lover (a lover)
I want a friend (a woman, a lover, a friend)

Yeah I want her right now
I want my little girl anyway, I want her anyhow
Please come on, baby
Just be my little woman, be my lover
