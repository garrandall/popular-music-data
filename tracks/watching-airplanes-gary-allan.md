Sittin Out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin my watch doin the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are gettin brighter

Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am i

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta act like you don't love me

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore

Yeah im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Go by, by, by
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Baby bye, bye, bye
