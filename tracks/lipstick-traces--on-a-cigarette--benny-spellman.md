Your pretty brown eyes
Your wavy hair
I won't go home no more
'Cause you're not there

I'm telling you now
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more

Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet

I've got it bad
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more

(Won't you come on home)
Won't you come on home
(Won't you come back home)
Won't you come back home

I'm crazy 'bout you
Can't do without you
Won't you come on home

Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet

I've got it bad
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more

I've got it bad
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more

(Leave me no more)
Don't leave me no more
(Leave me no more)
Don't leave me no more
(Leave me no more)
Don't leave me no more...
