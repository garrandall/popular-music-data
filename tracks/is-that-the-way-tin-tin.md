See the lights of Lisbon from a ship across the bay
Ello San Sebasti√°n going south
And everybody prouder was a million miles away
Is that the way to treat your guy?

Is that the way to treat your baby?
Is that the way to treat your guy?
Since you left me, girl
You know I've gone stoned crazy
Is that the way to treat your guy?

The distance that surrounds us
Is the same that now divides us
The only difference now's the table stand
You know you hurt me, girl
You broke my heart, you changed my world
Is that the way to treat your guy?

Is that the way to treat your baby?
Is that the way to treat your guy?
Since you left me, girl
You know I've gone stoned crazy
Is that the way to treat your guy?

Is that the way to treat your baby?
Is that the way to treat your guy?
Since you left me, girl
You know I've gone stoned crazy
Is that the way to treat your guy?
