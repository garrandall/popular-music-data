(No, no)
You can't hurt me no more
No matter what you might say
You can't hurt me no more
After all the pain you sent my way
Cause I've got another who loves me
And she's just the opposite of you
Hear me now
You can't hurt me no more
Cause it doesn't matter
Now what you do
Got ahold of yourself
Crying ain't gonna help you now
Ashamed that we end this way
And this is all that I can say
You can't hurt me no more
Give up cause I don't feel a thing
You can't hurt me no more
Go find another who'll play your game
Cause I've got another who loves me
And she's just the opposite of you
Hear me now
You can't hurt me no more
Cause it doesn't matter
Now what you do
You can't hurt me no more, baby
