I play the stereo loud
When I'm away from the maddening crowd
Smokin', jokin', clowns we all are

Sometimes I kinda get real ill
When I receive my monthly telephone bill
But you say it and I'll pay it
`Cause it helps me to


Survive stay alive
'Til I see you again
Survive stay alive
Can't say where it ends

Clouds lift and there are mountains below
Been a while since I've seen any snow
Chillin' so thrillin' so good to be back

Feels nice to be home for a while
Let's sip champagne til we break into smiles
We'll go dancin' romancin'
`Cause your the reason I
Survived stayed alive
Through the thick and the thin
Survive stay alive
When will it all end

But my bags ain't unpacked
`Cause I've got to go back and play
But I know we'll both

Survive stay alive
Through the thick and the thin
Survive stay alive
Until it all ends

Survive stay alive
When will it all end
Survive stay alive
Till I see you again
