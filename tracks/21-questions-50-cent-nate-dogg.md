New York City!
You are now rapping...with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe


Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?Girl...


If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, 
would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that


Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Boy... It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

I ain't looking for no superman to try and save me
I just want you to be my baby
Your sexy style got me going crazy
I wanna feel your body layin next to me
I can give you what you want, you need, and dream
I'll take care of you fulfill your fantasies
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers

Boy... It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our love if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only human girls we make mistakes, 
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile


Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Boy...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Now can we let the past go so we can have a future?
When a push comes to shove would you come through for me?
I can't be bad by myself be sad by myself
I can't be broke by my damn self
Would it be too much to ask for you to be a man?
And if you ever got mad would you cause me pain?
Would you call me sweet things 'cause I'm your babygirl?
Would I be your whole wide world?
Would I be the apple of your eye?
Would you ever want to make me cry?
If you really want me by your side
Tell me, how hard would you try?
Don't get mad 'cause I'm asking 21 questions
I've learned my lesson before and I need to know

Boy...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us


Could you love me when im chillin'?
Could you love me when I fuss?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
