I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon here
Put you in the box just as poisonous as a cigarette
Send my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was destined

I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go

I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get in the car just a little visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you blessed just kill critics
Bugatti never mean I'm rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got no boss staring
Got a good feeling
Mr Mike Caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go

I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go


When I need a healing
I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down
I know it's all better now

I know, I know, I know, I know, I, I, I, I think of letting go, go, go, go

I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
