Popping bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6

Gimme that Mo-moÃ«t
Gimme that Cri-cristal
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin wild
Get them bottles popping, we get that drip and that drop
Now give me 2 more bottles 'cause you know it don't stop

(808) Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up,
When sober girls around me, they be acting like they drunk
They be acting like they drunk, acting-acting like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be acting like they drunk

Popping bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6

Sippin on, sippin on sizz, I'mma ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangsta, popping bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

(808) Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up,
When sober girls around me, they be acting like they drunk
They be acting like they drunk, acting-acting like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be acting like they drunk

Popping bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6

It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't touch this)
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't touch this)
Hell yeah, make you put yo hands up,
Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up
Hell yeah, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up

Popping bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
