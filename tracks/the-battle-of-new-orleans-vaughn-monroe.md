In 1814, we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson
Down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon
And we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British
In the town of New Orleans

(CHORUS)
We fired our guns
And the British kept a coming
There wasn't nigh as many
As there was a while ago
We fired once more
And they began to running
On down the Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down the river
And we seed the British come
And there must have been a
Hundred of em beating on the drum
They stepped so high
And they made their bugles ring
We stood behind our cotton bales
And didn't say a thing

(CHORUS)
Old Hickory said we
Could take em by surprise
If we didn't fire our musket
Til we looked em in the eyes
We held our fire til
Ee seed their faces well
Then we opened up our
Squirrel guns and gave em, well

(CHORUS)
Yeah, they ran through the briars
And they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes
Where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the
Hounds couldn't catch em
On down the Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon
Til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator
And we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs
And powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off
The gator lost his mind

(CHORUS)
Yeah, they ran through the briars
And they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes
Where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the
Hounds couldn't catch em
On down the Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico
