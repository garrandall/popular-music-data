(The door is still open to my heart)
I must confess that I cry from loneliness
And the door is still open to my heart

You are to me like honey is to the bee
And the door is still open to my heart
I'm not ashamed to cry
It's better then to hold it inside
And I won't be satisfied
Until you're here by my side
You're as close to me as two is to three
And the door is still open to my heart

(I'm not ashamed to cry
It's better than to hold it inside)
And I won't be satisfied
Until you're here by my side
You're as close to me as two is to three
And the door is still open to my heart
And the door is still open to my heart
