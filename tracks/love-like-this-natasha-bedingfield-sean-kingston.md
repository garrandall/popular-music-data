Ohâ¦
Never find a love like this
Ohâ¦
Never find a love like this

We go back so far,
swinging in your back yard,
all the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
ooh I really liked you,
must have been your attitude.


That's why you keep on running
in and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by,
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you.
You're the only one that knows me,
love it when you hold me,
never find a love like this
Let me hear you say
now I'll never be lonely,
look at what you've shown me,
never find a love like this

Well this life tried to keep us apart
you keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
wrap your world around me,
never find a love like this.

All the guys tried to take me,
you're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice.



'cause this life tried to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
aren't you glad you found me,
wrap you all around me,
never find a love like this.


May never find a love, love, love a love like this,
that still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish
for you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
not to make you my wife,
man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rolling,
me and you, we strolling,
they don't wanna come around.


Let me hear you say,
you're the only one that knows me,
love it when you hold me,
never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say,
now I'll never be lonely,
look at what you've shown me,
never find a love like this.

When this life tries to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me,
wrap you all around me,
never find a love like this,

Ohâ¦ Never find a love like thisâ¦
When this life tried to keep us apart,
you keep calling me back to your heart,
Let me hear you say,
Ohâ¦ Never find a love like this.
Ohâ¦ Never find a love like this
