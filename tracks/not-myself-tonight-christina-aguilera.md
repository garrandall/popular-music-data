You know tonight
I'm feeling a little out of control
Is this me
You wanna get crazy
Cause I don't give a

I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
If you really knew me
You'd know it's not the norm

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

I'm dancing a lot
I'm taking shots
And I'm feeling fine

I'm kissing all the boys and girls
Someone call the doctor cause I lost my mind

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

In the morning
When I wake up
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But baby
Not tonight

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl)

Yeah
That feels good
I needed that

Yeah
Get crazy
Let's go

That's right
C'mon

Give it to me now
Don't stop
Yeah
