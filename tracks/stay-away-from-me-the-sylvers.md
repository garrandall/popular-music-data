Ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I loved you to the hill when you were mine
But time has passed since I saw you last
And that's just fine
I got someone else to ease the pain you left behind
But whatever you make to say a guy like me
You'll never find
But true love in you I'll never see

So stay away from me
So stay away from me

I hate to say my feelings for you still exists
But for steady case and a truthful face is what I miss
I don't need a girl who moves too fast
And gets a strain
I need a girl who's loving ways are here to stay
But I've found just a girl to soothe my need

So stay away from me
So stay away from me
Just stay away from me
Do you hear?
Just stay away from me

Ooh ooh

The life I had with you is come for you
Find someone else
That's where you always do
So stay away from me and don't come back
'Cause if you do, you'll have to face the facts
That true love in you I'll never see

So stay away from me
Just stay away from me
Just stay away from me

(Stay away, stay away)
You just had your play, so stay away
(Stay away)
You got the pay the cost for what you lost
(Stay away)
I got someone new instead of you
(Stay away)
I don't want you hangin' around
'Cause you put me down, oh
I don't mean to sound bold
But it's you to make to play this role
I just wanna be true, but not to you, oh
So stay away from me
Do you hear?
Stay away from me, yeah, yeah
Just stay away from me
