Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

Baby hold it,
and let me holla at you baby for a moment
And if you with it, Iâm with it, keep it rollinâ
And weâll be dancing and drinking until the morning
Until the morning

Starters going off
Itâs so hot thereâs girls just taking all their clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
Cause I donât wanna forget tonight, night, night, night

Put your lighters in the air
Let em burn into the night
And let everybody know
That your with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out of the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way)
Cause itâs hot in the club now, so donât let it stop now

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
And everybody say

Uh oh oh, uh oh


YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
All them bitches think they fly,
And all âem bitches flew to me
Hit the lights so you could see
My drink is strong and my hooka sweet
Understand the time is now, but time is up the future's bleak
It's me, it's stupid cupid
Love me, leave me in the morning
If you like your friend can join in
The wildest flower in the garden
Coolest nigga in the party
Shades on, dreads long
Blood gang, red zone
And Iâm with Jay Sean


Put ya lighters in the air
Let em burn into the sky
And let everybody know
That your with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out of the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way)
Cause itâs hot in the club now, so donât let it stop now

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
And everybody say

Tell em low, tell em high
Light it up to the sky

Tell em low, tell em high
Light it up to the sky

And everybody say

Uh oh oh, uh oh oh, uh oh oh

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight
So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out of the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way)
Cause itâs hot in the club now, so donât let it stop now
