I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart


Rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Oh, oh...oh, oh
Oh, oh...oh, oh...oh...

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you


But time makes you bolder


Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well...


Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well, I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you


Turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills


Well, the landslide brought me down


And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, maybe...
Well, maybe...
Well, maybe...


The landslide will bring you down
