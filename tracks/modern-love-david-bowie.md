I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done


I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try


There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try


Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love


It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try


Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love


(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on time) terrifies me
(Church on time) makes me party
(Church on time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love


Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)
