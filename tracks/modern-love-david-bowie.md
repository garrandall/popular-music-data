I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Modern love walks beside
Modern love walks on by
Modern love gets me to the church on time

Church on time terrifies
Church on time makes me party
Church on time puts my trust in
(God and man)
(God and man)

It's not really work, it's just the power to charm
Still standing in the wind
But never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Modern love walks beside
Modern love walks on by
Modern love gets me to the church on time

Church on time terrifies
Church on time makes me party
Church on time puts my trust in God and man

God and man no confessions
God and man no religion
God and man don't believe in modern love

Modern love walks beside
Modern love walks on by
Modern love gets me to the church on time

Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
Modern love
