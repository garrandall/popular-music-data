No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong


That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa


I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard


That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa


Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!


Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa


That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
