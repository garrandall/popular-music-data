Don't stay at home when I go away
Don't waste your time with letters each day
You can have fun and see everyone that you wanna see
Just keep all your love locked deep in your heart
And don't give the key to anyone else but me

Don't miss a party, don't miss the dance
Go on a date if you get the chance
Give him your hand and I'll understand that's how it should be
But, darling, keep all your love locked deep in your heart
And don't give the key to anyone else but me

You can be waiting without being lonely
Just save your love for your one and only

I won't be mad if you don't resist
If someone else should ask for a kiss
Give him the right to kiss you goodnight if it has to be
But, darling, keep all your love locked deep in your heart
And don't give the key to anyone else but me
And don't give the key to anyone else but me
