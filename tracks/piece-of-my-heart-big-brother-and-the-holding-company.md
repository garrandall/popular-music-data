Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on


Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man? Yeah
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did
And, and each time I tell myself that I, well, I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough


I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it


Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, come on)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well, you know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed


You're out on the streets looking good
And baby, deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well, I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again


I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it


Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah
(Oh, oh, have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well, you know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good

I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it


Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon now
(Oh, oh, have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it, wow


Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good
