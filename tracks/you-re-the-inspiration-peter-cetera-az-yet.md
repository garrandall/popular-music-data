You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love to last forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart, in my soul

Baby, you're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me saying
No one needs you more than I need you

And I know, yes, I know that it's plain to see
We're so in love when we're together
Now I know, now I know
That I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know
Everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart, in my soul

Baby, you're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me saying
No one needs you more than I need you

Wanna have you near me
Wanna have you hear me saying
No one needs you more than I need you

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
Bring feeling to my life

You're the inspiration
When you love somebody
Till the end of time
When you love somebody

Always on my mind (No one needs you more than I)
When you love somebody
Till the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind (No one needs you more than I)
