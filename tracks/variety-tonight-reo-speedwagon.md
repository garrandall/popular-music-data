If ever you think you miss the thrill of the chase
Or just get tired of the same old face
I can be different honey, I can be new
Want someone else, I can be that too


Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey if you want it, variety tonight
Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey you got it, variety tonight

The faces of love have their smiles and frowns
And every romance has its ups and downs
There are cases when love has been less than sweet
Love without hate is a little like light without heat



And the fire will fade if you forget it
'Cause love can't live unless you let it
Whoa, you gotta try just a little harder with the passin' days
You got to find some new ways, ow!



 repeats out...
