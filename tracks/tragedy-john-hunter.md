It's three a.m.
Can't fall asleep
This must be loneliness
But man, it's black and deep
It was just no use
Hanging on
I'm a mess since you're gone
With my love

I'm breaking down
Come off the wall
It's been so long since
We talked at all
Such a sad excuse
Be a man
Let it go understand
That it's gone

Every day is just another page
In this tragedy
Every day is just another page
In this tragedy

Baby, please take me back
I'd give my soul
To get us back on the track
Well it's just no use
Hanging on
Like a fool
Like a dog when you're gone

Every day is just another page
In this tragedy
Every day is just another page
In this tragedy

It's a crying shame
The shape I'm in
I just stop crying
Then I start again
Each day's the same
More memories and sorrow
But if you don't want to love me
Baby where is tomorrow

Oh, whoa
Oh, baby please
Remember me
Have you forgotten
How you worshiped me
How I set you free
Making love
I'm a fool; you won't talk to me now

Every day is just another page
In this tragedy
I can't believe that
I've been replaced
In your fantasies

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Here comes the sun
But it's always gray
'Til you come back to me
