Take me across the water 'cause I need some place to hide
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride aha

Oo..ooo Ooooo Ah ah ah
Oo..ooo Ooooo Ah ah ah

Well there's a hundred miles of desert lies between his hide and mine
I don't need no food and no water, Lord, 'cause I'm running out of time

Fightin', killin', wine and women, gonna put me to my grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life

Oo..ooo Ooooo Ah ah ah
Oo..ooo Ooooo Ah ah ah

Stood on a ridge and shunned religion thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake stealin' when I should've been buyin'

All that fightin', killin', wine and those women, gonna put me to an early grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life,

So I stood on a ridge and shunned religion thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake stealin' when I should've been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should've been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should've been buyin' yeah
Stealin' when I should've been buyin'
