Hot and dangerous,
If youâre one of us, then roll with us.
âCause we make the hipsters fall in love.
And weâve got hot-pants on and up.
And yes of course we does,
Weâre running this town just like a club,
And no, you donât wanna mess with us,
Got Jesus on my necklace.

Iâve got that glitter on my eyes,
Stockings ripped all up the side,
Looking sick and sexy-fied,
So letâs go-o-o

Tonight weâre going hard-hard-hard-hard-hard-hard,
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours-ours-ours-ours,
Weâre tearinâ it apart-part-part-part-part-part-part,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!

Weâre dancing like weâre dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb,
Our bodies going numb-numb-numb-numb-numb-numb,
Weâll be forever young-young-young-young,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!

DJ turn it up,
Itâs about damn time to live it up,
Iâm so sick of being so serious,
Itâs making my brain delirious!

Iâm just talkinâ truth,
Iâm telling you âbout the shits we do,
Weâre sellinâ our clothes, sleepinâ in cars,
Dressinâ it down, hittinâ on dudes (HARD!)

Iâve got that glitter on my eyes,
Stockings ripped all up the side,
Looking sick and sexy-fied,
So letâs go-o-o (Letâs go!)

Tonight weâre going hard-hard-hard-hard-hard-hard,
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours-ours-ours-ours,
Weâre tearinâ it apart-part-part-part-part-part-part,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!

Tonight weâre going hard-hard-hard-hard,
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours-ours-ours,
Weâre tearinâ it apart,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!

DJ turn it up,
And turn it up
And turn it up
And turn it up

OW!

Tonight weâre going hard-hard-hard-hard-hard-hard,
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours-ours-ours-ours,
Weâre tearinâ it apart-part-part-part-part-part-part,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!

Tonight weâre going hard-hard-hard-hard,
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours-ours-ours,
Weâre tearinâ it apart,
You know weâre superstars,
We R who we R!
