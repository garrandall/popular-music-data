As I ride this lonesome highway
The desert wind across my face
My mind slowly wanders
To another time, another place

When the world was so much younger
With no reason to hold back
And we weren't so afraid of losing
All the things we'd never had

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Your had a dream you once believed in
That burned inside you like a fire
And that big wheel kept on turning
Somehow that dream it passed you by

Now that fire just keeps on burning
Leaves only hunger and desire
Gotta find yourself a new dream
And leave the rest behind

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Somewhere over the horizon
Where the darkness meets the light
We'll marry all our dreams together
Out on this open road tonight

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

On the open road
On the open road
On the open road
