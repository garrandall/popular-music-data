Yes
Tony Toni Tone
And DJ Quik
You didn't think we could flip it on yo ass, huh?
Something for the dance floor
In a real way
It's going down like this forever
And a day

Now what you hear is not a drag
Cuz Mr. DJ Quik got a brand new bag
But first I gotta bang bang
A boogie for the boogie
To the rhythm of the ghettoey streets
Check it out now
You trying to give me some Eight Ball
But no way 
I'd rather have a Mimosa
With Crystal and O.J.,  yeah
Just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around naked
But wait a second

The function's on
Around midnight
What time is it
Are you inside
Available
To come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to
Look for you 


Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down 
In my black Chevrolet
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down

Yeah, now we don't need a club
We can do it at my house
My front door's open so homey's can bust it out
And ladies if you're coming leave your children at the nursery
So you can get slow on the Anniversary
Kill me
I dip dip da
So don't be looking stupid when I unfasten your bra
You know you want to mack this
Because I come stronger than the IRS
Whenever you done got delinquent on your taxes

Now here I am 
Staring at you 
I need a drink
You need one too
Who is your friend
She don't look nice
But I know she will
Later on tonight
Come on lets get down



Now I'm at the club
And I'm off that drug
The one they call alcohol got me acting y'all
I hump two first before I hump two more
And now I'm throwing up my guts out the car door
Over consumption you know how it is y'all
Got your homey beggin' for some Pepto Bismol
But when my stomach's right I'll be back tonight
To get that lady I was grinding on the wall
Now that I feel a little better than I felt a little while ago, yeah
I'm going back to the same spot
Where I met you on the floor

Now table one, that's my folks
And table two, that's my folks
And everybody knows my name
Now table three that's B. Grund
And table four that's G-One
You best be prepared
Cuz it's all a game you know

Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet

I gotta get my groove on (keep movin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
I gotta get my groove on (keep movin' and groovin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
I'm groovin' (say what?)
Movin' (yeah)
Yeah
