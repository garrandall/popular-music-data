Umm ah the good thang man
Uumm ah the good thang man

Hey all of you women now girls gather all around
I wanna rap to you about gettin on down
Well in the world of love well I got to be the king
And in the world of girls well I'm the good thang man (real good thang)

Well ill make you fell fine girls like you never thought you could
I make you sang the campbel soup song you know
Ummm umm humm good

I got a whole lotta yum yum aww girls I'm yummy
And sugar fingers on my hands
Ill keep them roaming all over you
Yeaahhh cause I'm the good thang man aww baby

Well I'm the good thang man I got to say it again
And i'll make you tame tamee cause I'm the good thang man aww baby
I'm like grapes on a grape vine yeaaa well I'm peaches on a tree,

Just A hangin on me well i'll make you hum umm
And i'll make you tame i'll whoop it to you
Mellow oo hoo cause I'm the good thang man aww baby

Yeahh I turned on joan ummm we did it alnight long
I shot some thrills to jill umm now we was up on the hill'
