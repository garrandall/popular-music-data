Get together, get together, get together, you gotta
Get together, get together, get together, you gotta
Get together, get together, get together, you gotta
Get together, get together, get together, you gotta
Get together, get together, get together, you gotta

I need you, you need me
So let's as lovers
Cause we need each other
One more night
Tell the truth
We are guilty of the same


Time to get together
We gotta make it happen
Love is what we're after
Time to get the world to spin
We gotta make it happen
Yeah, yeah yeah

Sing it loud, now

You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
Hey, You look like a boo- boo- boom

Without love
And we need a lot of something
Love is that something we gotta start to give more
Start to grooving on to live for

You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
Hey, you look like a boo- boo- boom

We give all to the one we love
We gotta make it happen

We gotta get together

Yeah yeah yeah
Sing it loud now
Sing it with your friends now
You look like a boo- boo- boom
Sing it with your friends now
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boom
You look like a boo- boo- boo- boom
