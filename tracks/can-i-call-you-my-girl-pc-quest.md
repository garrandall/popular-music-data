There's a feeling deep inside of me
That I just can't let slip away
It's your tenderness that fills me with love
And I hope it's here to stay

Now you've got that look in your eyes
From the very first time we met
And you've caught me by surprise
No matter what I do, I can't forget


Can I call you my girl
Ohh whoa be my baby
Can I call you my girl
You've stolen my heart
Can I call you my girl

There's a dream in my mind of a boy and a girl
Wishing on a falling star
As they kiss in the night
She can feel such love
She's sure she's found the one for her

And you've got that look in your eyes
From the very first time we've touched
And you've caught me by surprise
You're the only one, I'm dreamin' of



Here in this world, a boy and a girl
Were meant to feel this way
So don't you be afraid
When I turn to you and say
