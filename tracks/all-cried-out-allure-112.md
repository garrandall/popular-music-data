All alone on a Sunday mornin'
Outside I see the rain is fallin', whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
But the rain will hide my cryin', cryin', cryin'
And you...


Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry


I
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you


(Oh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)


Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) Oh, yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone


Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Tears will cause an inferno baby
Romance often fades why should I take the blame?
Why should... why should I?
You were the one who left me neglected
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected


I... (Whoa)
I gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you


I
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you... (Left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
So sorry
Over you


Yes, I'm so sorry
Please forgive me, baby!
Oh-oh, whoo!
Please forgive me...
