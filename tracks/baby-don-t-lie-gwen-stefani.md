Uh-huh
Here we go


We've been walking down this road for some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's somethin' behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise


Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie


We've been walkin' down this road for some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's something behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise


Baby, tell me there's nothing below
Baby, tell me there's nothing below
Here we, here we
Come on


Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie


Whatcha hiding, boy?
Whatcha hiding, boy?
I can tell whatcha been hiding boy
And you can tell me if I'm getting warm
Am I gettin' warm?
Am I gettin' warm?
Am I gettin' warm?
And you can tell me if I'm gettin' warm


Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie
