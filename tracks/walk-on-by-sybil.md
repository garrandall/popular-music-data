If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by
Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private
Cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so, if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so, if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
