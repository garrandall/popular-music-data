Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oh not a lot of people left around oh oh


In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down


I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun


Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oh not a lot of people left around oh oh


In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down


I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post


Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
I don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day


I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun


Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Oh oh
