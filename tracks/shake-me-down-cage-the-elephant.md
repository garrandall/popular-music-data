Shake me down.
Not a lot of people left around.
Who knows now.
Softly laying on the ground.
Not a lot of people left around.

In my life I have seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories
Plagued by constant misery.
Their eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground.
Their eyes cast down.

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun.

Shake me down,
Cut my hair on a silver cloud.
Broken sound
Softly laying on the ground.
Not a lot of people left around.

In my past bittersweet
There's no love between the sheets.
Taste the blood, broken dreams,
Lonely times indeed.
With eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground.
With eyes cast down.

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun.

Turn back. Now it's time for me to let go.
Way down had to find a place to lay low.
Lamp shade turned around into a light post.

Walk around the corner.
Never saw it coming.
Still I try to make a move.
It almost stopped me from belief.
I don't wanna know the future,
But I'm like rolling thunder.

Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.
Even on a cloudy day.

I'll keep my eyes fixed on theâ
I'll keep my eyes fixed on theâ
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun.

Shake me down.
Not a lot of people left around.
