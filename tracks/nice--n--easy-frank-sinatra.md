Let's take it nice and easy
It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby what's your hurry?
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

We're on the road to romance - that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it every time

We're on the road to romance - that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it
Nice and easy does it
Nice and easy does it every time

Like the man says one more time
Nice and easy does it
Nice and easy does it
Nice and easy does it every time
