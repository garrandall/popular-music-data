I know you well
And I can tell
Something's on your mind

'Cause in your dreams
The demon screams
I know he's going to hurt you blind

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all 
We need to get us through

And diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle
Like your smile

And as for fame
It's just a name
That only satisfies
You for awhile

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through

I've heard it said
Or maybe read
Only money makes
The world go round

But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should
Tumble to the ground

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

So listen
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is
All we need to get us through

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
Just one thing to say
Love
