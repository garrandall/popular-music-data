The dream never dies
Just the dreamer
The dream never dies
If it's strong
The song never dies
Just the singer
So come on, everybody
Sing along

Some men dream of fame
And some of fortune
Some men dream about
Time gone by

All men dream of someone
They'd like to become
Cause without dreams inside us
Yeah, without dreams
How would we all get by

The dream never dies
The dream never dies
So, come on, everybody
Dream along

Some men dream of Heaven
And some of the Lord above
Some men dream about
Pie in the sky

All men dream of happiness
And all men dream of love
Cause without dreams to guide us
Yeah, without dreams
How would we all get by

The dream never dies
The dream never dies
So, come on, everybody
Dream along

The dream never dies
The dream never dies
So, come on, everybody
Dream along

The dream never dies
Just the dreamer
The dream never dies
If it's strong
The song never dies
Just the singer
So come on, everybody
Sing along
