Just a little rain falling all around
The grass lifts its head to the heavenly sound
Just a little rain just a little rain
What have they done to the rain

Just a little boy standing in the rain
The gentle rain that falls for years
And the grass is gone the boy disappears
The rain keeps falling like helpless tears
And what have they done to the rain

Just a little breeze out of the sky
The leaves pat their hands as the breeze blows by
Just a little breeze with some smoke in its eye
What have they done to the rain

Just a little boy standing in the rain
The gentle rain that falls for years
And the grass is gone the boy disappears
The rain keeps falling like helpless tears
And what have they done to the rain
What have they done to the rain
