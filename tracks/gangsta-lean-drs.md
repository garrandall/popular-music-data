This song's dedicated
To my homies in that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon?
It seems like yesterday
We were hangin 'round the hood
Now I'm gonna
Keep your memory alive
Like a homie should

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be- We'll be hangin' out


This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean


My God, my God
Could you pass on a message for me?
Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory?
So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out


This is for my homies
This is for my homies
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
You know I miss you, you know I miss you, my homie
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean


This song is decicated to homies in that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy Y-B
And my boy Eibere
And whoever else out there
Thats gotta homie thats in a gangsta lean
And also my boys in the pen
That ain't ever gonna see the street again
Cause you know what?
It don't matter what they was doing while they was here
They couldve been bangin', slangin'
But they ain't here no more
And thats somebody's daddy
Somebody's baby, that's somebody's homie
So go on and let 'em rest while they in that gangsta lean
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's on the real, loc


This is for my homies
I can't believe that your gone
See you when I get there
I'll see you, I'll see you, I'll see you
Illlll see you
This is for my homies
Now that your in that gangsta lean, well well well
See you when I get there
I'm so sorry you're gone but I've got to keep on
(This is for my homies)
I gotta keep movin', I gotta keep movin
I gotta keep movin', movin', movin', movin'
(See you when I get there)
I'll see you, I'll see you
One day, someday, homie, someday
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, yeyeah
See you when I get there
