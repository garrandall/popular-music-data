I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams


And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried


I thought love was more or less a given thing
More I gave the less I got, oh yeah
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine, I got rain


And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried


What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain


And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried


Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
Now I'm a believer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm a believer
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm a believer
