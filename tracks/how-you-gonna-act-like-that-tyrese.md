It seems like just the other day that we hooked up.
I was driving, you was walking, and I swooped you up.
From that moment on I knew you were the one.
I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love.

We would sit and talk for hours about anything.
"Baby, you hang up. No, you hang up. On three hang up."
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything.
Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced.

How you gonna act?
How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up?
We just finished making up.
How you gonna act like that?

How you gonna act like we don't be making love?
You know we be tearing it up,
Breaking stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip and how could you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

Girl, I never thought that loving you would hurt.
I did everything a good man would to make it work.
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts.
Like before I put the down on the house we bought.

Now I'm thinking you and me was a mistake,
But then it hits me and I'm missing all the love we made.
Girl, I know that we've been going through some things,
But the sun is somewhere shining even when it rains.

I'll be the one you kick it to.
I'll be the one that misses you.
I'll be the one to ease your pain.
I'll be the one you'll want to gain again.

You'll be the one I can't forget.
You'll be the one that's heaven-sent.
You'll be the one I can't deny.
You'll be the one that make me cry,
Baby.

How you gonna up and leave me now?
Why you do?
How you gonna act like that?
Why you gotta act like that?
How you gonna change it up?
Whoa, ho, baby.
We just finished making up.
How you gonna act like that?
But I need you.

How you gonna act like we don't be making love?
Whoa, baby, baby.
You know we be tearing it up,
Breaking stuff, that ghetto love.
How you gonna trip, and how could you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

You know I'm willing to do anything
Just to keep you in my heart.
Keep you in my heart.
I messed around and gave up everything.
I thought we'd never part.
Yes, I did, baby.

I was a player, and I made the choice to give my heart to you.
And I gotta keep it that way, oh, baby.

How you gonna up and leave me now?
Oh, baby.
How you gonna act like that?
Why you gotta treat me this way?
How you gonna change it up?
Why you treat me wrong?
We just finished making up.
How you gonna act like that?
Can me somebody tell me why, why, why?

How you gonna act like we don't be making love?
You know we be tearing it up,
Breaking stuff, that ghetto love.
Oh, oh, baby.
How you gonna trip?
All my friends became your friends.
How can you forget?
All my ends became your ends.
How you gonna act like that?

Keeping love ghetto (All I want is you)
How you gonna act like that?
Keeping love ghetto (All I need is you)
How you gonna act like that?
Keeping love ghetto (All I need is you)
You know we be tearing it up,
Breaking stuff, that ghetto love.
Keeping love ghetto (All I need is you, all I need is you, babe.)
How you gonna act like that?

How you gonna up and leave me now?
Oh, babe, how you gonna act like that?
How you gonna act like that?
Hey, hey.
How you gonna change it up.
We just finished making up.
Why you acting so shady, oh, oh, baby?
How you gonna act like that?

How you gonna act like we don't be making love?
Anything you want in me I got ya, hey.
You know we be tearing it up,
Breaking stuff, that ghetto love
Why you acting so shady?
How you gonna trip?
Oh, oh, baby
How can you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
