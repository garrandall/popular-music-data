Usher, baby
I hear you, yeah
Rock with me
Fuck with me


Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready


She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...


You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see


I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me?
Sex education
Hands on when you're with me
Can you handle me?


She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...


You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see


Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest


You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
