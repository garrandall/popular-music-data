I always knew
Someday I'd find her
Sweet little girl like you
To give me peace of mind
I knew that she'll be there
To hold my hand
I knew the girl would be there to understand

I found the one
No, I found the one
I found the one
Oh yes I did
I found the one
Oh, I found the one
I found the one
Oh yes I did
Listen to this

I never will forget the day
She walked into my life
She said "Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright"
She said "I got a little money, if you want that too"
I looked at the woman and said "I don't need no money
Just a little love will do"

I found the one
I found the one, ha ha
I found the one
No, oh
I found the one baby
Girl, I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all
I found the one
Oh yes I did
