Ooo ooo ooo yeah
La la la, la la la la la la la (x2)

A girl I wanted all my life
I asked her to be my wife
She said yes (she said yes)
I didn't have money for a wedding band
Still she went & took my hand
She said yes (she said yes)
La la la, la la la la la la la (x2)

Her folks had some other plan
For her to marry another man
She said no (she said no, she said no)
They didn't particularly care for me
But our love was meant to be
'Cause she said yes (she said yes, she said yes)
La la la, la la la la la la la (x2)
Ooo yeah

(Instrumental)

Listen, I'm thankful for love I've found
Thank you for changin' my life around
Thank you for the love you gave me day by day, oh

Other love has come & gone
But our love seems to linger on
'Cause she said yes, oh yes she did (she said yes)
While other loves have faded away
Our love grows stronger day by day
'Cause she said yes (she said yes)
(Repeat & fade):
La la la, la la la la la la la
