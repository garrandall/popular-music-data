If you're comin' home, like yah letters say
And the place you're staying now, ain't too far away
Can you write tonight, just to let me know
'Cause since you've been away girl, I've missed you so

You won't let me down
'Cause I'm sure you're homeward bound
And you'll be back safe and sound
'Cause I just know

Baby make it soon, make it soon
I can't wait another day
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you, come on

Baby make it soon, make it soon
Can't you make it right away
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you
Right back here, here in my arms

If you're comin' home, like you promised to
Can you write tonight and tell me, what you're gonna do
'Cause I'm lonely now, and I'm gonna stay that way
Until I hold you, in my arms again

You won't let me down
'Cause I'm sure you're homeward bound
And you'll be back safe and sound
'Cause I just know

Baby make it soon, make it soon
I can't wait another day
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you, come on

Baby make it soon, make it soon
Can't you make it right away
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you
Right back here, here in my arms

You won't let me down
'Cause I'm sure you're homeward bound
And you'll be back safe and sound
'Cause I just know, whoa oh c'mon

Baby make it soon, make it soon
I can't wait another day
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you, come on

Baby make it soon, make it soon
Can't you make it right away
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you, come on

Baby make it soon, make it soon
Can't you make it right away
