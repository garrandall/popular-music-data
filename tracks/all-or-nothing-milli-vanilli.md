The game of love is to live it up
And baby not too high.
Don't you know, if you wanna get down with Mister P
You gotta go and let your backbone slide.
What feeling when you push it up, push it down.
You gotta push it up, push it down. Feel good.
George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you.
Baby don't tease. Oh, just please
'cause you know it's just me and you.
All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.
All or nothing, push, girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.
I'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow.
Give me some time and maybe, our love will grow.
I want to suit you baby and make it right.
Take it from me babe, I wanna rock all night.
If it's good for me, it's good for you.
You gotta never let your mood get dry.
Just keep it wet and my seven forty jet
Is pushing right on high.
George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you.
Baby don't tease. Oh, just please
'cause you know it's just me and you.
All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.
All or nothing, push, girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.
I'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow.
Give me some time and maybe, our love will grow.
I want to suit you baby and make it right.
Take it from me babe, I wanna rock all night.
Push it up, push it down.
Push it where it feels real good.
On my lips my sweet bumble bee.
Sting me like I knew you could.
All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're lyin' under me.
Oh, oh, nothin' girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro, who's rockin' to the beat.
