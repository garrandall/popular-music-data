Ohhhh oh! (Yeah! It's my tape man) Whoa
Whoa ohhoh!ohisten to my tape)
I've waited, yeah! (WOO!)


If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend if you promise you'll be mine?
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
They say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now, girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend


First we get the talkin, then we get the touchin'
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin'
I kiss like the french then put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (Ha Ha)


You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
That's why I'm here standin' by your side cause you always come through for me
So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me
Glad you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me


Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me baby)
Can I be your best friend, I promise boy you'll be mine
(Oh baby be mine)
I said he's just a friend, baby it's not pretend
Either he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend


If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend


While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on


I'm not afraid to explore my body - ohgimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'
You tried to sing to me; you're never on the key, but you do it just to appease me
I rather spend my time wastin' time with you; ohee you make it so easy


Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round all the time)
Can I be your best friend, I promise boy you will be mine
(Please baby be mine yeah!)
I said he's just a friend (Oh Oh!)
Baby it's not pretend (No baby)
Either he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend


We been better than friends, for a long time
Ain't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine
We been better than friends, for a long time
Ain't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine


If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
