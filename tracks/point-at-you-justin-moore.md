I've always been one of them boys
Rollin' around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights

Red light running, good time chasing,
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fightin' side after a few
If they wanna see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you

Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone

I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me wanna haul ass home

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fightin' side after a few
If they wanna see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Point at you yeah

Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me
Lord knows I'm hard to hold
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides
And I ain't letting you go
Cause my best side is holding me close
Point at you, yeah

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fightin' side after a few
If they wanna see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Oh baby, I just point at you
Girl I point at you
Oh babe my best side is you
Girl I point at you
