By the way you look at me I truly do believe
Something is worrying Your troubled mind
There is something on your mind


By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
Whoa, yeah
Can what you're thinking
Bring our happiness
Or will it bring misery


No, no, no, no, no, no
Please don't try to tell me
I think I understand
No, no, don't try to tell me, pretty baby
I tell you, I think I understand, whoa, yeah
You want me to try and forget you
Well, I'll do the best I can
