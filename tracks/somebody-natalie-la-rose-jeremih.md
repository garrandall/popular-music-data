Come on
Natalie La Rose


I wanna rock with somebody (Woah yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (Shots, shots, shots, shots)
I wanna leave with somebody (Somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Nobody)


Aye, I wanna rock with somebody like you
I don't know another that could do what you do
Every night turned up baby girl, I'm Lil Zoo
Going hard all night and we're gonna play it cool
And they so nosy (aye)
Everybody can't be in our business
They don't know me (aye)
I want you, God is my witness


(You already know me, S-A-G-E)
Uh, stepped in real Bay Area
Yeah, swag on perkiness
Pull up in the foreign, and they automatically thinking
A nigga like me supposed to live in Eastridge
Lights, camera, action, get the ball rolling
Now bring the girls, get 'em all going
I'm just tryna live like the pallbearer
And we gon' make noise, let 'em all hear us


And you know just what I wanna do
I wanna rock with somebody (Woah yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (Shots, shots, shots, shots)
I wanna leave with somebody (Somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Nobody)


Why can't everybody know what's good?
'Cuz some gon' hate what's new
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool


And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave, we turn and say
We never going ho-ome, ho-ome
(And you know just what I wanna do)


I wanna rock with somebody (Woah yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (Shots, shots, shots, shots)
I wanna leave with somebody (Somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Nobody)


Troy Ave wanna rock right now
I came in the spot with the guap to get down
Money, my watch say it's time to get down
Over the couch, it's ten toes on the ground
Now we doin dance moves, coolin' my temples
Got more chicks they can pull so we get loose
Order up shots, girl, you don't get juice
Till them back shots come, then you get juice
Powder!


And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave, we turn and say
We never going ho-ome, ho-ome
(And you know just what I wanna do)


I wanna rock with somebody (Woah yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (Shots, shots, shots, shots)
I wanna leave with somebody (Somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Nobody)
