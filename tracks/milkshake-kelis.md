My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,

Damn right its beter than yours,

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,

Damn right its beter than yours,
I can teach you,
But i have to charge!

I know you want it,
The thing that makes me,
What the guys go crazy for,
They lose their minds,
The way i wind,
I think its time,



Lala-lalala,(LaLa)
Warm it up, (thats disgusting)
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting,
Lala-lalala
Warm it up,
Lala-lalala,(LaLa)
The boys are waiting,



Boy's wanna know how my milkshake taste
See them fanstise when they look in my face
Want a slice of my icecream cake
Cream in the middle how many licks will it take
How u want it my flavor last hours
Once you've had mine your gurl was sweet and sour
Let me feel that candy cane
See if u can make my candy rain
Throw it back and your girl wont bug
All over me like a cup of hot fudge
I'm your peppermint patty wanna scope
Boy let me satify your sweet tooth

I can see your on it,
You want me to teach thee,
Techniques that freaks these boys,
It can't be bought,
Just know things get caught,
Watch if your smart,

Lala-lalala,
Warm it up,
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting,
Lala-lalala
Warm it up,
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting,

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its beter than yours,
I can teach you,
But i have to charge!

Oh once you get involved,
Everyone will look this way-so,
You must maintain your charm,
Same time maintain your haylo,
Just get the perfect blend,
Plus what you have within,
Then next his eyes are squint,
Then he's picked up your scent,



Yeah FlipeMode Baby
It go's one for the money, two for the club
Three for the eat and i dont mean da
Chose your own weppin
Jersey im reppin
Home boys a sling more rock the led zeplin
Bitch mob hold me down
Spit round for round
Milk shakes that will make u drown
Even worse then that kennedy boy they found
WHO LOVE holla back wen u hear the sound
Cuz im something like a fa-nom-in-nonm (shake)
And aint none of ya chickens are rum-enough (bounce)
Fall back you aint got the stum-in-na (brake)
Type heat that will buss a ter-mo-meter (bounce)
And if your rollin up or your chasen tail
Digga Digga in the house and we got it for sale
Grade A all day brothers chocken up
Night fall in a party we be smoking up
Dat...
