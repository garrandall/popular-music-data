LL
Radio killer
Yeh
Y'all think they can handle this one man
Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song (this your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)
Cuz I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
Im your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle

Shawty im your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cuz wit whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy

Cuz shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

(Cuz im your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cuz he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love thats quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cuz im your baby

In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know im a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't curr
She all in the rearview doin her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay

Cuz shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
