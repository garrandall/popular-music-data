Watchin' from her basement window
People's feet goin' by
Hidin' away, my favorite buddy and I
People walkin' by outside
Don't even know we're around
But we're livin' in our own
Little piece of this world
In a clubhouse underground

Hideaway, come on along and hideaway
Hideaway, in our own little hideaway

We can get a chance
To talk about a romance or two
This is the place
I'll meet you here after school

And I can ask a secret question
I've been wantin' to know
And you can hideaway until you're ready
To let your feelings show
