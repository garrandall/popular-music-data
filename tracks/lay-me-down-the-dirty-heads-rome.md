Well this is how it starts
Two lovers in the dark
On the run, from the one
That they called Sheriff Spark

Six guns by their side
And bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase

The safe was nearly empty
And they were nearly free
But were seen by the good eye of the mean Billy Green

And he screamed at the top of his lungs
They're on the run
It's the two outsiders
Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that we could stay here
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun

We gotta pack our bags this instant
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we arrive there so safely
Baby you can lay me down

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds

Now they're crossing borders
Sheriff's posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell

They drank up all the whiskey
And They partied every night
Like it could be the last
The bounty said shoot on sight

So they chased the endless summer knew it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running 'til they found their paradise

But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free to find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said

I said I think that we can stay here
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun

So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby you can lay me down

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well you're my green-eyed girl
And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do

So wipe the dirt off
Or take your shirt off
And we should go hit the cantina
We got work off

I said it's hot outside
Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down, make me smile

I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach
That's why it's salty when we kiss

I said I think that we can stay here
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun

So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby you can lay me down

Lay me down
Lay me down, no
Lay me down
Lay me down
