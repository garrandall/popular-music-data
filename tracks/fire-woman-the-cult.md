Fire woman, yeah

Shake, shake, shake, shake it, yeah

Wound up, can't sleep, can't do anything right, little honey
Oh, since I set my eyes on you
I tell you the truth
T-t-t-t-twistin' like a flame in a slow dance, baby
You're driving me crazy
Come on, little honey
Come on now

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire, yeah
Smoke on the horizon, well
Fire 
Smoke, she is a rising fire 
Oh, smokestack lightning
Smokestack lightning

Well, shake it up, you're to blame, got me swayin' little honey
My heart's a ball of burnin' flame
Oh, yes it is
Trancing like a cat on a hot tin shack
Lord, have mercy 
Come on little sister 
Come on and shake it

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smoke on the horizon, yeah
Fire 
Smoke, she is a rising fire 
Oh, smokestack lightning, baby

I was thinking what I've been missing
I'll tell you truthfully, well
She's coming close now
Oh, I can feel her
She's getting close to me
And I never, yeah

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smoke on the horizon
Fire 
Smoke, she is a rising, rising, rising fire 
Smokestack lightning
A-j-j-j...

Burnin' out
And shake it baby
Gotta have money

Stand down in front of me
Say, san stam bye to me
Say, san stam bye to me, yeah

Fire woman, you're to blame...
