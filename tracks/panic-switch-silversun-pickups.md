Time
It's never worth my time
Blue shine bleeds into my eyes

I still
Sleep on the right side
Of the white noise
Can't leave the scene behind

Could I be anything you want me to be?
It's always meant to be seen

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

And I'll try
To hold on tight tonight.
Pink slip inviting me inside.

Wanna burn skin
And brand what once was mine,
But the red views keep ripping the divide.

If I go anywhere you want me to go,
How will I know you'll still follow?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and flailing and fading

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?
