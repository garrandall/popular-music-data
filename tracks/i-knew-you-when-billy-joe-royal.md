Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
I knew you when

I knew you when
You were sad and all alone
You didn't have anyone
That you could call your own

I knew you when
Your heart belonged to only me
But that was many tears ago
Now your love is just a memory

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
I knew you when

I knew you when
We used to have a lot of fun
But someone new could offer more
Now I'm the lonely one

I knew you when
You were just a scared little girl
I used to be your only love
Before you came up in the world

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
I knew you when
