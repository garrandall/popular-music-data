Well, I've never been so lonely
And I've never been so blue
I'm leaving in the morning
Gonna backtrack to you

Your picture's here beside me
And never leaves my sight
I'm kissin' like I'm kissin' you
Oh, how I'm missin' you tonight

Well, tomorrow night will be a different story
Well, I get to hold you in my arms again
Will you find it in your heart to forget me
If you do how little fool I've been

I'm hoping and I'm praying
That all my prayers all come true
I'm leaving in the morning
Gonna backtrack to you

Well, tomorrow night will be a different story
Well, I get to hold you in my arms again
Will you find it in your heart to forget me
If you do how little fool I've been

Gonna backtrack to you
Gonna backtrack to you
Gonna backtrack to you...
