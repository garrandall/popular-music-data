Well it was Friday in the p.m.
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man Willy said I like to really
But Idol's on TV
And Ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me


Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled Who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a Franklin and a shot of Patron
She looked right at me and said
What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?





Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight 

Let's have a little fun tonight
