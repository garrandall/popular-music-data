There was a time in my life 
When I opened my eyes and there you were, 
You were more than a dream, 
I could reach out and touch you, 
Girl that was long ago. 
There are somethings that I guess I'll never know, 
When you love someone You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you, 
That's when everything's all right, 
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever. 
When I dream about you, 
Girl you never go away, 
Just close my eyes 
Wait for my dreams, 
Cause I still love, loving you.

How can I get you to see 
That I'm falling apart 
Since you've been gone, 
I can never be sure 
I could ever let go 
Your love is much to strong, 
There are somethings that I guess 
I'll never know, 

When you love someone 
You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you, 
That's when everything's all right, 
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever. 
When I dream about you, 
Girl you never go away, 
Just close my eyes 
Wait for my dreams, 
Cause I still love, loving you.

There are somethings that I guess 
I'll never know, 
When you love someone 
You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you, 
That's when everything's all right, 
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever. 
When I dream about you, 
Girl you never go away, 
Just close my eyes 
Wait for my dreams, 
Cause I still love, loving you.
