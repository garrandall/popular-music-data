Everybody loves a clown, so why don't you?
Everybody laughs at the things that I say and do
They all laugh when they see me coming
But you don't laugh; you just go home running

Everybody loves a clown, so why can't you?
A clown has feelings too

I joke around at a party when you are there
But you don't laugh, you don't look; you just don't care
If you wondered why this clown is crying, look a little closer; inside I'm dying
It's not easy to be in love, you see
When you're a clown like me'

I don't know how to say that I love you
'cause you would smile and say 'tell a joke or two.'
Yes, I'm a clown, but I don't want to be
Why can't you see the other side of me?

Guess I'll be the guy who plays the part
Of a clown with a broken heart

Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
