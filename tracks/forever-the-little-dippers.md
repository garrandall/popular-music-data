If we both stand with absent eyes
and think about the oceans, watch 'em dry
We can see far to the other side
It's you and I forever, we don't have to hide

If we ignore the signals that Mission Control will send
It's one big ship ride anyway, this hell will never end
And gaze out on what they left of the stars
All we see now we can take as ours

You've two have got just moments left to give
Come back now and we will let you live
Stay inside our blue protective eye
We won't let them take you, we won't let you die

My baby spins propellants, the system's set to blow
She's at the Milky Way now, exploding into sound
And she's constructed flashpoints to cover up the sun
While I sleep under glass I know that she will wake me when she's done
