There's a song I'd like to sing
Do you know the song I mean
It don't know the way it sound the same
But it's always good to sing
Anyone one can say the words
Anyone can sing the tune
If you take a little time
I can teach this song to you
And we can get to know each other
Like a sister and brother
Like a father and a mother
Like a woman and a man
And we can sing along together
Just enjoy in tune it's over
You don't need to last forever
If we want it to be again
Maybe it don't mean a thing
It's a pretty little tune
It's a song I'd like to sing
That I'd love to sing with you
