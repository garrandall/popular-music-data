 Listen up everybody if you want to take a chance
 Oh, my God, we're back again
 Don't worry about nothing 'cause it wont take long
 Got a question for you better answer now

Am I original?
Yeah
Am I the only one?
Yeah
Am I sexual?
Yeah
Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now

 (ohhhh)
 Everybody
 (ohhhh)
 Everybody,
 (ohhhhh)
 Rock your body right

Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

You are my fire
My one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are
'Cause I want it that way


Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl (step!)
Hey girl, in your eyes
I see a picture of me all the time (step!)
And girl, when you smile
You've gotta know that you drive me wild (step by step!)
Ooh baby, you're always on my mind (step by step!)
Ooh girl, I really think it's just a matter of time
Step by step!


From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that'd we would be together forever, yeah
'Cause I deserve a try honey just once
Just give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see?
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die then live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die then live without you
I can't live without you


Please, don't go girl
(We've been together for a long time, baby)
Please, don't go girl (don't go girl)
Please, don't go girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away
'Cause you're my best friend, girl
You're my love within
I just want you to know
That I will always love you
Oh
Please, don't go girl

First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song
Say oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
The right stuff
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
The right stuff


All you people can't you see, can't you see
NKOTBSB
Everytime we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life (Yeah)
Every time were down (somebody say yeah!) (Yeah)
You can make it right (everybody say yeah!) (Yeah)
That's what makes you larger than (yeah) life (here we go!)
All you people can't you see, can't you see
NKOTBSB
Everytime we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger...
That makes you larger...
That makes you larger than life
