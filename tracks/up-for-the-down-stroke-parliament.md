Talking 'bout he's mad
Let's take it to the stage, jack, come on!
And get up for the down stroke

Get up for the down stroke
Everybody get up


Everybody get up

Get up for the down stroke
Everybody get up


Party!
It's all about party, yeah!
Having a party, y'all
(Get up for the down stroke?) (get down!)
(...A joke)

Get down on the real side

Get up for the down stroke
Everybody get up


Woo, hoo hoo!

I don't care about the cold, baby
'Cause when you're hot, you're too much
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot
Look at what you've got


(Give me the claps)
(Let's take it to the bridge)
(What?)
(He talkin' bout he mad!)
(Make it funky now)

Get up for the down stroke
Everybody get up


Party!

I don't care about the cold, baby
'Cause when you're hot, you're too much
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot
Look at what you've got


Party, baby party!
You're hot
Let's take it to the stage!

I don't care about the cold, baby
'Cause when you're hot, you're too much
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot
Look at what you've got (oh, my godfather!)

I don't care about the cold, baby (get up for the down stroke)
'Cause when you're hot, you're too much
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot
Look at what you've got

I don't care about the cold, baby (get up for the down stroke)
'Cause when you're hot, you're too much
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot
Look at what you've got
