On our block all of the guys
Call her Flamingo
'Cause her hair glows like the sun
And her eyes can light the skies
When she walks she moves so fine
Like a Flamingo
Crimson dress that clings so tight
She's out of reach, she's out of sight

When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh every guy
Would make her his
If he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day I'll make her mine
Pretty Flamingo
And every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh every guy
Would make her his
If he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day I'll make her mine
Pretty Flamingo
And every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Sha la la la la la la pretty Flamingo
Sha la la la la la la pretty Flamingo
Sha la la la la la la pretty Flamingo
