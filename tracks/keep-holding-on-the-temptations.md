Your truth is like
A woman brought me
Since I've been here
A woman taught me
Don't worry about
What you can't control
Do your best
And leave the rest alone


Keep holding on
Sometimes your back is against the wall
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on


Well well
You got to enjoy each day to survive
'Cause you'll never gamble and like your mind
You gotta celebrate (Celebrate)
Every day you live


I still remember
Since I was just a child
My mother held me in her arms
Mama said, that every day


You got to keep holding on
Don't let nothin' get around you
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on
Son, gotta keep holding on


Hang on tight
Give your life a fight
You gotta be strong
Keep on pushing on


Risk it, every night, there's a mountain
You must climb
Well, sometimes your friends, you got to leave behind
I remember when mama said, said


You got to keep holding on
Don't let nothin' get around you
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on
Stand up and be a man
Keep holding on


Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Keep holding on, hang on
Hold on, keep holding on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Keep holding on, hang on
Hold on
