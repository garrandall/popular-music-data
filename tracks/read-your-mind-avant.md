I had to do a remix for the ladies
can you blame me?

I stepped in a club in your hood 
I slowly turned left and there you stood
You and your friends talking
But when our eyes connected I knew then 
It was just like 2 ways on beem
I'm your king be my queen
So whatever you wanna do,
don't this remix feel like whooooo

I can read your mind babe
I know what you're thinking
And it's alright with me
It's alright, yes

I can read your mind babe
I know what you're thinking
Girl I'm off in your head 
So let's get in bed
And do what your mind said, whoooo

So baby take a ride with me 
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body that's my goal
So baby just come down here
And let the gravity whoooo, whoooo

I can read your mind babe
I know what your thinking
And it's alright with me 
It's alright, yes

I can read your mind babe
I know what you're thinking
Girl I'm off in your head
So let's get in bed
And do what your mind said

I know you wanna rub me 
Know you wanna touch me 
Know you wanna feel me
Baby keep it real
Know you wanna see
Know you wanna be
In my B.E.D. we'll be getting freaky


I can read your mind babe
I know what you're thinking
And it's alright with me
It's alright,yes

I can read your mind 
I know what you're thinking
Girl I'm off in your head
So let's get in bed 
And do what your mind said, whoooo

Wanna love baby
Wanna feel you
If you come, If you come
Wanna love baby
Wanna feel you
