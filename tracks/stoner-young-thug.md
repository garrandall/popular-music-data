When you were worrying about pissing on your fuckin' self, I was a stoner
Bang gang
Dun Deal on the tra-tra-tra-track
Way back in 90-fucking'-4 when I was six or seven...
Ayy, ayy, this that stoner music, nigga
Stoner! (This my damn bit!)
Stoner (Let's get it)


I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Stoner!)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner


I just put a 40 on my wrist just like a boss
I just put 10,000 on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f****** boss
Just like a f****** boss, just like a boss, boss


Thugger Thugger, you
I want Michael Jackson land, oh
Aww, I'ma cash out (On what?)
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me (Moon)
I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo (What?)
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo (Ha)
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo (Like Fabo)
I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo (Fabo)
I'm back at it (What?), Juug man voice (Yung Ralph, hahaha, hehe)
Bankhead
Hear my song way from Y-T-C-R-O-B-S-M-M, now we YSL venom, sis
Slime Thugger wit' it (Wit'), Slime DK wit it (Slatt)
Slime Wicced wit' it (Slatt), Slime Mondo wit it (Slime)
Slime Slugger with it (Slime), Slime Bubba wit it
Slime Check wit' it (Yeah)
Count hundreds and 50's off everyone's city


I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (What?)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Ye)
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner


I just put a 40 on my wrist just like a boss (I feel like Fabo)
I just put 10,000 on my bitch just like a boss (I feel like Fabo)
I just drank with YSL just like a f****** boss (I feel like Fabo)
Just like a f****** boss, just like a boss, boss


Run that money up, like ya 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean, molly, E (Whoo)
Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a lil' closer, my bitch won't know ya
Andalé andalé andalé, andalé andalé andalé
How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive on a YSL runway
(How fool?)
My glasses are metro no blood off your chest
I control ya ho like Net-and-flix
Your bitch is my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs, T-Rex


I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner


I just put a 40 on my wrist just like a boss
I just put 10,000 on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss
Just like a f- boss, just like a boss, boss


I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel just like
