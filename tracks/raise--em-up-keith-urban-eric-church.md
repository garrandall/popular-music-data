Raise em' up
I'm talkin' 'bout lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like
And you sing along

Raise em' up
I'm talkin' 'bout daddy's old pick-up truck
Shotgun seat there's the one you love
And you're kissin' on

Get those white sails sailin' down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass
If you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes
Up to the sky
Comin' home you've been gone too long
Tonight we're gonna
Raise em' up

Raise em' up
You've got a voice, you've got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let em' tell you
Who you are

Raise em' up
Fist black and blue
Fight for the truth
It's what you do
Hand on your heart
For the stripes and stars

Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
Sunday morning coming down
Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
And as the flag flies say goodbye
Tonight we're gonna raise em' up

So you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And then babies come
Raise em' up 
Raise em' up

Raise em' up
Trophy high
Raise em' up
To the sky
Raise em' up
Show everybody that new born smile
Raise em' up
Tall and strong
Raise em' up
Right from wrong
Raise em' up so damn high they can hear God singing along

(Woah)
