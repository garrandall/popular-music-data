In a land of dreams and fairy tales
Kings and queens to be so magical to me
When the ship has sailed to Neverland
The light of the guiding star
Will take you to heaven
And back to where we started from

When the darkness falls
End the day break
And the midnight rolls heaven
Hear the nightingale in the moonlight
Sing my song

Enter the story of fire
The seven books of life
In the magic of dark
Its cover dressed in silver and dust from a star
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire
Enter the story of fire
The seven books of life
In the magic of dark
Its cover dressed in silver and dust from a star
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire

On the night of stars where dark prevails
Gold will turn to sand and heel to my command
When the mocking jay sing back to me
A warning of what to come
Will take you to places
Adventures you were searching for

When the darkness falls
End the day break
And the midnight rolls heaven
Hear the nightingale in the moonlight
Sing my song

Enter the story of fire
The seven books of life
In the magic of dark
Its cover dressed in silver and dust from a star
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire

The one to rule them all
It's magical in every story
Cause we will stand or fall
We're flying into darkness and light of the holy

Enter the story of fire
The seven books of life
In the magic of dark
Its cover dressed in silver and dust from a star
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire
The winter's coming
Rise of the dragon empire
