There are two kinds of teardrops (two kinds of teardrops)
That I know you can cry (two kinds of teardrops)
One is known as lonely teardrops (two kinds of teardrops)
That come when lovers say goodbye

I know the last lover you had
He let you down and treated you bad
I know he made you cry, oh yeah
I know he made you cry
Those lonely teardrops

But there's another kind of teardrop (two kinds of teardrops)
That I know you can cry (two kinds of teardrops)
And they're known as happy teardrops (two kinds of teardrops)
That come from feeling good inside

I'll make you cry those tears of joy
I'll mend the heart he nearly destroyed
I'm gonna make you cry, but don't worry
I'm gonna make you cry
Those happy teardrops

I know your little heart has suffered in vain
He hurt you over and over again
But he won't hurt you any more, so
Just forget the lonely past
And the romance that didn't last
And dry those lonely teardrops from your eyes
(from your eyes)
