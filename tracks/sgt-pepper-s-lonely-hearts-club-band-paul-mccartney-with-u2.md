Well, it was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile So let me introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band It's
Wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, yeah
