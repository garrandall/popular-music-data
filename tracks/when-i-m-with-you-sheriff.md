I crept up from above and took you out
Look its a new sheriff in town
Hope you know that you are going down
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 


My drop top back in the new westsell
5509 girl I live real well
Got the michellin s rims what up sprewell
Swaggerlicious baby something like a pimp
Ha, you know I get it, gucci new fitteds
Deputy Diggum Dan, give em the business
Ha, dont fake the funk you know we get it girl
KC they know the camped all across the world
Dont make me have to light shit up
Got the real canaries boy I brighten shit up
Got a sloppy juke in, better tighten that up
My cash game up, my gas gauge full
You fly crook push ki's and go to school
Ive never met a nigga like me I do what I do


We dont need no badges
We dont need ya address
We know where you live
You know what this is
The kids you should put em in the truck with wifey
Before I let me nina start singing like a ??
Brother discover the pleasure the pain
Whether you survive is the name of the game
Put em on a stretcher blood pressure to the brain
Its an ethical medical let-it-go mayne
You a buster yo trust us its a west coast thang
?? fuck with us got the best scope aim
You choke up I break out the high grade smoke thangs
And this beat was produced by Rob the Vikang

I crept up from above and took you out
Look its a new sheriff in town
Hope you know that you are going down
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 


Ive been on my grind since a kid on my big wheel
Dont know how to put this but I'm kinda a big deal
Little giant stop trying to assume
My position I'll be firing my iron at ya dudes
Bang Bang my crew gang bang the slang gang
Doper than a kilo of columbian bam bam
Rocking with a king ping doing my thing thing
Listen to ya album and then I drain my main vein
Hornet dog-gon-it my boss is all on it
Imma duke of hazzard your crews a has-been
Popping pills in yemen I got stupid habits
A ruthless addict, gucci fabrics
My group is magic and my troops are savage
I'm a little dude with a very big ego
So I roll with very big people
Bad mutherfuckers not saying we evil
Feels like everything we do is illegal
Im fly like an eagle, eagle
Listen to you rapping and I whip it like devo
I aint a clown dawg cash invested
Friends ride bikes black vests and death heads
Fucked up times cant trust you best friend
I got friends doing ten from what I just suggested
Im Yosemite Sam my two cannons go BAM!


I crept up from above and took you out
Look its a new sheriff in town
Hope you know that you are going down
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 

I keep my hand on my ?? when I lay the sheets
Bitch touch my baby ?? fuck wit my sleep
We the comeback kids like Eli and Peyton
Brothers from another like 50 and shaved head
Fuck you saying and fuck you payment
Pimping aint easy but the money amazing
Now we the best, its high time I remind you
We can drop a body off were no one can find dude
I'm in a crime mood so I'm a get cash
Vision is point dawg criss cross steve nash
Cat like reflex, playing some defense
I cant guard niggas so I stay on defense
I dont pretend to speak false pretense
I spring right in action make you fall like ??
?? Chi-Town make you stay on the bull shit
Im like oh shit who you think you fucking with


I crept up from above and took you out
Look its a new sheriff in town
Hope you know that you are going down
Bang Bang Bang Bang I shut ya down
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now) 
Look at ya now (look at ya now)
