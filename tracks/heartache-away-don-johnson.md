Didn't know til I was alone
How much I'd miss your love
When you were gone
Waking up without you was all it took
That's when I knew

What I thought
That I wanted
Feels a lot
Like a heartache don't it
If I could go back
Clean the slate
Just like that
Change my mind
Hit rewind
Make you love me
Just one more time
Everything I've done
I'd undo
And I'd still have you

I'd still hold you in my arms at night
Instead of laying alone wondering why
It took you going away
For me to know
It was a big mistake

What I thought
That I wanted
Feels a lot
Like a heartache don't it
If I could I'd go back
Clean the slate
Just like that
Change my mind
Hit rewind
Make you love me
Just one more time
Everything I've done
I'd undo
And I'd still have you
yeah yeah

I just wanna love you one more time
I just wanna love you
I just wanna take back all I've done
I just wanna undo
I just wanna love you one more time
I just wanna love you
I just wanna take back all I've done
I just wanna undo
Yeah yeah

What I thought
That I wanted
Feels a lot
Like a heartache don't it
If I could I'd go back
Clean the slate
Just like that
Change my mind
Hit rewind
Make you love me
Just one more time
Everything I've done
I'd undo
And I'd still have you
yeah yeah

I'd still have you
Ohhhh
oh I'd still have you
yeeaaaahhhh
oh ho yeah
oh ho yeah
