I'm back on the street
Baby, I'm downbeat
You know it's you I see
In every girl I meet

I'm giving you up
And it's getting me down
Everybody's talk, talking at me
It's all the same sound

I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Love's a heartache away

When I lost you, baby
I lost it all
They say in love and romance
We all take a fall

Go to places we'd go
And talk to people we know
I'll get over you someday
Love's just a heartache away

I hang up the phone
I go out alone
Nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache away

I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache
A heartache away

I'm giving you up
And it's getting me down
Everybody's talk, talking at me
It's all the same damn sound

I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache away

Hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache
A heartache away

Love's a heartache away
(A heart ache away)
It's just a heart ache away
(A heart ache away)
Love's a heartache away
