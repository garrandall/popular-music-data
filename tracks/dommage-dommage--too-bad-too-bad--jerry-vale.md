Dommage, Dommage
Our love was once exciting
Now it's just a game we play.
Too bad, too bad
But nothing lasts forever
All at once
We lost our way.
Hello, goodbye
And suddenly it's over
And there's nothing we can do.
Dommage, Dommage
But may your next attempt at love
Come true

Hello, goodby
And suddenly it's over
And there's nothing we can do.
Dommage Dommage
Too bad we couldn't
Make our dreams come true.
