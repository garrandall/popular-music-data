You and me got somethin', (baby)
That I know is good (do-do-do-dewh)
You know how to love me, (baby)
Just the way you should
And when you hold me baby
I know I can do no wrong
And when I see you standin' there
I know just where I belong, aouw

You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so goooood

I told you when I met you (baby)
That I was going up (do-do-do-dewh)
And if you stuck right by me (baby)
I'd give you all that fancy stuff
And then you told me "Baby
Well anything you do if fine
Well I done care if we got nothin'
Just as long as you are mine

So good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so goooood

Well, So good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so good (good) good (good)
You make me feel so goooood
