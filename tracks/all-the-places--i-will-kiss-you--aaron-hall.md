There's so many places I wanna kiss you, baby
I cannot begin to start
I realize that I'm not the only man that made love to you
But I'm the only man who knows how to keep you
Okay, baby, your body's mine, believe it, mmm
All the, the places I will kiss you
Oh, baby, let me kiss you (please let me kiss you) with all my love (you
Know I love you, girl)
All the (yeah), the places I will kiss you (all the places)
Oh, honey, let me kiss you (let me, baby) with all my love (with all my
