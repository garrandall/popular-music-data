They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough,
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who likes to see men suffer
To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's Hardhearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk about your cold refrigerating mammas
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas
To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like being in Alaska in your B.V.D.'s
That's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A
