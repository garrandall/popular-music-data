Yes, Adam was happy
As a man could be
'Til Eve started messing
With that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She's never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette watched
Those cats at the gate
Then cried in French
Said, let em eat cake

Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time

Yes, Adam was happy
As a man could be
'Til Eve started messing
With that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
They're never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman
Yes, that's just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
