Treat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's the view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
