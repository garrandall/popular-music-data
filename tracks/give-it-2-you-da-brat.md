I'm gonna give it!!

I'm gonna give it to you
Cause Da Brat's in the place!
I'm gonna give it to you


It's me, the O. G. funk bandit
Who's that?
The B to the R-A-T and in fact
If you ain't heard of me
Take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust for yo ass on this funkdafied mission
Just kick off your shoes and relax your feet (That's right)
Party on down with Da Brat and her beat!
Now it goes like that and thats how it goes
I'ma give it to all you negroes and hoes
So listen up, make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit cause this bitch be bad as hell!
Truth of matter is I splatter kids
That talk shit
And in a gangta's way, that's how them fool's get dealt wit
So want you wanna do bitch, don't even trip
Step up, step up
And I'ma bust yo lip
Cause I know that you know that I know you don't want me to
But keep on trippin' and I'ma give it to you


I'm gonna give it to you
Gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Gonna give it to
I'm gonna give it to you


Brat is the
Fantastic, romantic, single-handed bandit, and damn it
Don't get no better
Better it don't get no more
Than the flow that I flow for you negroes and hoes
Devastating, captivating, elevating, And am I
Smooth Operating and I love to get high
Well nigga fire up, nigga fire it up
At your request I guess it's time for me to get fucked up
It goes
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4
From the bottom to the top, top to bottom I go
So now you know, what I ain't and what I is
It's the baddest new bitch in this hip-hop biz
O. G. Is what I
Am
A brat is what I
Be
Blunts are what I
Smoke
And you can't see
Me
So let it go, cause my shit is tight
Take it how it give it and enjoy the night


I'm gonna give it to you
For the 9 fuckin' 4, it's Da Brat and you don't know
(I'm gonna give it to you)
You betta ask some mothafuckin' body
Lodi dodi I came to party
Bee-otch!
Ha ha ha
Ay, JD sing this shit with me, boy
(I'm gonna give it to you)


Word up hey, word up hey
Word up hey, for real though, shit
Word up hey, word up hey
Word up hey, for real though

I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
