Give it 2 you
1 for da money
2 for da bass
3 to get ya goin'
Cause da brat in da place

It's me, da o.g. funk bandit (whose dat? )
Da b-2 da -r-a-t and in fact
If you ain't heard of me
Take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust 4 yo ass on dis funkdafied mission
(just kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down wit da brat and her beat)
Now it goes like dis and dat how it goes
I'ma give it to all you negroes and hoes
So listen up, make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit 'cause this bitch be bad as hell
(true of matter is I splatta it) talk shit
And in a gangta's way dat's how dem fool's get dealt wit
So want you wanna do bitch, don't even trip
(step up, step up) and i'ma bust yo lip
'cause I know dat you know dat I know you don't want me 2
But keep on trippin and i'ma give it 2 you

(brat is da fantastic, romantic, single-handed bandit,
And damnit)
Don't get no betta
Betta it don't get no mo
Than da flo dat I flo
4 you negroes and hoes
Devastating, captivating, elevating, am i
Operating and I love 2 get high
(well nigga fire up, nigga fire it up)
At your request I guess it's time for me 2 get fucked up
It goes (1 puff,2 puff, 3 puff, 4)
From the bottom 2 the top, top 2 bottom I go
So now you know, what I ain't and what I is
It's da baddest new bitch in da hip-hop biz
O.g. is what I (am)
A brat is what I (be)
Blounts are what I (smoke)
And you can't see (me)
So let it go, 'cause my shit is tight
Take it how it give it and enjoy da night

4 da nine fuckin 4, it's da brat and you don't know
You betta ask some muthafuckin body
Lodi dodi I came 2 party
Beeee-itch!!!

Word up hey, word up hey, word up hey, 4 real doe
Shit, word up hey, word up hey, word up hey, 4 real doe
