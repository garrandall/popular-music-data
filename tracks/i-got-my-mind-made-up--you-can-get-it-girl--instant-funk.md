I got my mind made up
Come on you can get it
Get it, girl, any time
Say what? Tonight is fine

I got my mind made up
Come on you can get it
Get it, girl, any time
Say what? Tonight is fine

You gotta push it to me, baby
Push it to me, baby
You gotta slide it to me, honey
Slide it to me, girl

If you want my money
If you want my money
You gotta make it good as honey

I got my mind made up
Come on you can get it
Get it, girl, any time
Say what? Tonight is fine

You've got me groovin'
Just keep on movin'
Keep movin', keep movin'
Feeling's really soothing

Keeps me movin', yeah, yeah, yeah

I got my mind made up
Come on you can get it
Get it, girl, any time
Say what? Tonight is fine

I got my mind made up
Come on, you can get it, get it
