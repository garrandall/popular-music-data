Hello, it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long.
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
Seeing you,seeing anyone as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care.
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through,baby.

It's important to me
That you know you are free
Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe (don't change, don't change)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world (don't change, don't change)
No, don't change, girl (don't change, don't change)
Stay as sweet as you are (don't change, don't change)
But one thing I want you to do is,

Think of me, think of me, yeah
You know I'd be with you if I could,
Come around and see you once in a while,
If you ever need a reason to smile,
I'd spend the night if you think I should.

It's important to me
That you know you are free
Cause I never want to make you change for me

And I'll come around and see you once in a while,
If you ever need a reason to smile,
I'd spend the night if you think I should.

Just don't change, girl (don't change, don't change)
