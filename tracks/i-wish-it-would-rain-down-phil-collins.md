You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend (yeah)
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I, oo... now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo... yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooo... yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo... yes I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
I guess you were right (yeah)
Oo... I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again (yeah)

Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo... yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooo... girl I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo... yes I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
And I know, well it's eating me through, it's eating me through, night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cause I know, I know I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realise I let you down (oh yeah)
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no

Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Oh you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Oh yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me
Just rain down on me
Just let it rain down, let it rain down, let it rain down...
Oh yeah. Let it rain down, (rain) rain down over me.
Just let it rain down,
Just let it rain down, let it rain down.
Just let it rain...
