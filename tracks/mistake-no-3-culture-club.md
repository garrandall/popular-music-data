You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow
Into strange and pretty faces
I don't know
Clutching to my lipstick traces
Watch them go
Make Mistake Number 3
It's strange how much it changes
How they want to know
How cynical are people
That's where children go
Dragged into a conversation
They can't hold
It's so sad but it prepares them
For the mould
Make Mistake Number 3
Why is my love like an ocean run dry?
And why is my love
such a struggle with life?
You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow
Make Mistake Number 3
