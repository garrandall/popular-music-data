Oh son


Around these parts, ain't much to do
Except work like a dog until Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday (it's about that time)
About that time
There's a party back in the woods tonight
Heard it through the redneck grapevine
Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls
Sure enough going to be a good time


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown


Oh, we about to throwdown, son
Now we got a field full of daisy dukes
Round here we know how to grow them
Rocking little body and long tan legs
Sure ain't scared to show 'em, now
Show a little something, girl
Somebody said them city boys
Riding around looking for some trouble
If they bring it across that county line
You know there's gonna be a rumble


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown


It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown
It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown
It's a small town throwdown


That's country
