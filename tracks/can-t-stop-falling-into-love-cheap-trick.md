Yeah, ooh ooh, yeah yeah

Hey little ladies there's some cool young dude
Just standin' in line and waitin' for you
There's a girl in the corner with a jacked up dress
She's got legs for miles but but her face looks a mess

There's always something for everyone
But a love can be suicide, oh yeah yeah yeah
It's just what you've been waiting for
And I know it can't be denied, yeah

Can't stop fallin' into love
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinking of

Hey rock 'n rollers, what's a happenin' with you
You've got the itch, well I've got it too
It's hard to be a winner every time
But I know you take it, you can make it all right

It's time that you just can't hide
But I can't control myself, oh no no no
I know what you've been waitin' for
'Cause love can't be denied, yeah ooh

Can't stop fallin' into love
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of

There's always somethin' for everyone
And I know what you mean in my eyes, oh yeah yeah yeah
I just can't control myself
And I fall for it every time oh yeah

Can't stop fallin' into love, yeah
What's my heart been dreamin' up
No matter what I think or do or say, hey
I keep fallin' into love

I can't stop fallin' into love, yeah
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of

I cant stop fallin' into love ooh
What's my heart been dreamin' up
No matter what I think or do or say hey
I keep fallin' into love

I cant stop fallin' into love ooh
Every pretty girl that I see, gets the best of me
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of
