Seven days of Saturday
Is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday
Because I don't rest in peace
Don't need no Mondays
Or the rest of the week
I spend a lot of time in bed
But baby I don't like to sleep no
I won't lie to you
I'm never going to cry to you
I'll probably drive you wild eight days a week


Until I'm six feet under
Baby I don't need a bed
Going to live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they roll me over
And lay my bones to rest
Going to live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead


So you're looking for some action
I got got everything you need
Better keep your motor running
Because I was built for speed
This ain't no slumber party
Got no time for catching z's
If they say that that ain't healthy
Well then living's a disease
We're never going to die baby
Come on let me drive you crazy
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve




Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead
Going to live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Seven days of Saturday
Is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday
Because I don't rest in peace
I was born to live
You know I wasn't born to die
But if they party down in heaven
I'll be sure to be on time




I feel like I'm exploding
Going out of my head
Going to live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until I'm six feet under
And they lay my bones to rest
Going to live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead
Going to live while I'm alive, sleep when I'm dead
