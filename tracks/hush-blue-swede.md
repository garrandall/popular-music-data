Na nanana nanana nanana

I got a certan little girl she's on my mind 
No doubt about it she looks so fine 
She's the best girl that I ever had 
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad 

Na nanana nanana nanana

Hush, hush 
I thought I heard her calling my name now 
Hush, hush 
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now 
Hush, hush 
Thought I heard her calling my name now 
Hush, hush 
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now 

(Love, love) 
They got it early in the morning 
(Love, love) 
They got it late in the evening 
(Love, love) 
Well, I want that, need it 
(Love, love) 
Oh, I gotta gotta have it 

She's got loving like quicksand 
Only took one touch of her hand 
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep 
That I can't eat and I can't sleep 

Na nanana nanana nanana

Listen 
Hush, hush 
Thought I heard her calling my name now 
Hush, hush 
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now 
Hush, hush 
Thought I heard her calling my name now 
Hush, hush 
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now 

(Love, love) 
They got it early in the morning 
(Love, love) 
They got it late in the evening 
(Love, love) 
Well, I want that, need it 
(Love, love) 
Oh, I gotta gotta have it

I'm alive!
And I see things mighty clear today, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I'm breathin' clean, fresh air today, I'm alive!

I'm alive!
Who cares if my hair is a little bit long, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I'm doin' my thing and singin' my song, I'm alive!

I'm real!
I can see and touch and taste and feel and I'm alive!
I'm a man!
And I'm red and yellow and black and tan, I'm a man!
