Mama always told me don't let myself get caught
Don't want to see me alone and turned out
Living dangerous has a gruesome price
Puts your soul into a lonesome light
Respect yourself because there's no one else who respect you
And if you don't then they won't

You get put into a mould, labelled a loosie, an avenue hoochie
I'm all about me, living my life right cause life is a treasure
Dis peer pressure, I gotta be me
Can't be the rest of them
Grow and show that I can flow with the best of them
Never try to be shady, a lady
Money go and don't amaze me
I'm not living to be wed
Before I commit I'll establish a one on one with myself

One-by-one we can make it,
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one

Back in the day when I was in high school
Time was mine and my mind was a tool
All work and no play said Jack
Apply yourself said dad, but get back
I had to hang with the girls in the mall
Parties all night was yes yes y'all
Homework can't me
After cramming all night
At school I would sleep

Wasn't thinking of life's pop quiz
Or the real world or school was preparing me to outgrow
Until senior year rolled up
And everything but my grades I'd rolled up
Now I come about life
Suddenly hanging with the girls was no go
I started getting to class on time
Doing homework and using my mind and now
I'm fine

One-by-one we can make it, can't fake it
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one

Thinking back to when coming up wasn't much brother
Rode the hood so in me you thought you couldn't trust
Steady talking to your friends dripping off what they say
Dripping off the he say she say babe
I think we would have a debate, kick back chill
And maybe we could set things straight
I'm not all about the hiding duck
You know the time honey quit with the games
I'm not
Why you want to come off half-cocked out to me
You know I'm acting through to your record shop
Kicking it, with benny making plenty, so honey
Dial my beeper or my corner when you wanna get with me
And you could chill like god be on the down low
Parlay, parlay like grand poobahs say anyway
So don't clip off your no-nonsense friends flow
Cause if you don't, I'mma have to let you know

One-by-one we can make it, can't fake it
If we are to be as one
One-to-one, it's not hard to relate to
If you open up your heart
Love one by one
Love one by one

We can make it if we try (love one by one)
Love (love one by one)
Love one by one
Love one by one
We can make it you and me
Love one by one
Love one by one
Love one by one
