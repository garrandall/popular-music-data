Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumbling down

Darling (reach out)
Come on girl, reach on out for me
(Reach out) reach out for me

I'll be there
With a love that will shelter you
I'll be there
With a love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up
Cause your best just ain't good enough
And your feel the world has grown cold
And your drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold

Darling (reach out)
Come on girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) reach out for me

I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you
(I'll be there to always see you through)
(I'll be there to love and comfort you)

I can tell the way you hang your head
You're not in love now, now you're afraid
And through your tears, you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinking
You're alone now, no love of your own

But darling (reach out)
Come on, girl, reach on out for me
(Reach out) just look over your shoulder

I'll be there to give you
All the love you need
And I'll be there
You can always depend on me...
