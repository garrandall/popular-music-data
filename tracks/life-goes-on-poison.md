I've felt this before
Now I feel it again
No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end
So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
I keep telling myself that...

Chorus:
Life goes on
While your miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on
As night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

You healed up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears
But one fear I kept to myself
How I prayed that you loved no one else
Like you're saying you love me...

Chorus:
Life goes on
While your miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on
As night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

If you only knew
How much I miss you

Solo

When my mind plays it's tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see
That's why I tell myself now
I keep telling myself now
Just take another piece of me...

Chorus:
Life goes on
While your miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on
As night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

Love goes on
While your still miles away
And I miss you
And this last mile
I travel with you
Yeah, Yeah
