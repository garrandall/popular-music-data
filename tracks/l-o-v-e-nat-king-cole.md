L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can


Love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it, take my heart and please don't break it
Love was made for me and you


L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can


Love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it, take my heart and please don't break it
Love was made for me and you


Love a-was made for me and you
Love a-was made for me and you
