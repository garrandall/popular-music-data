Rachel:
It won't be easy
You'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change

Kurt:
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new

Rachel:
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Kurt:
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you

Rachel:
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise

Kurt:
Don't keep your distance
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is

Rachel:
I never left you
All through my wild days

Kurt:
My mad existence

Rachel:
I kept my promise

Kurt:
Don't keep your distance

Rachel:
Have I said too much?

Kurt:
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do

Rachel:
Is look at me to know

Kurt and Rachel:
That every word is

Kurt:
True!

Rachel:
True!
