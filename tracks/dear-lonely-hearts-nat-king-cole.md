Dear Lonely Hearts
I'm a-writing to you
You said you could help
People looking for love

I've been so lonely
I don't know what to do
And that is why
I'm writing this letter to you



(It's no use living)
When you're alone
Please help me find
A love of my own

If you know someone
Please tell me who
Dear Lonely Hearts
I'd be so grateful to you (so grateful to you)

(She don't have to have money) She don't have to have money
(She don't have to be a queen) She don't have to be a queen
(As long as she loves me) As long as she loves me
(That's the important thing) That's the important thing

Cause I'm gonna love her (I'm gonna love her)
I'll always be true (I'll always be true)
Dear Lonely Hearts
Oh please see what you can do (see what you can do)

I guess that's all (I guess that's all)
I'm gonna close them now (I'm gonna close them now)
But try to find (Please try to find)
Somebody somehow (Somebody somehow)

If you know someone
Please tell me who
Dear Lonely Hearts
I'd be so grateful to you (grateful to you)
