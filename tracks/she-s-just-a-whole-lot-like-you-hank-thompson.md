I found you again in somebody new
It's sorta like old time doing things we used to do
She's just about your size that same look in her eyes
Yes she's just a whole lot like you

But I'll never tell her she's like my used-to-be
I never want to hurt her the way that you hurt me
Because I know she loves me the way you used to do
And she's just a whole lot like you

She tells me little sweet things the way you used to do
A million years ago when our love was fresh and new
I hear you when she talks and I see you when she walks
Cause she's just a whole lot like you

Somehow I found the way to live again it seems
Just to be with someone like someone in my dreams
The reason that I love her I'm still in love with you
And she's just a whole lot like you
