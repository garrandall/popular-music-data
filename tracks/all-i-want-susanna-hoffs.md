Can't ignore or hide away
Can't escape from the things that line our way
Take it, leave it, break it
Anyway, you can't get back to yesterday

All I want and all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
You better listen from now on

Confidence, coincidence, call it a sin
It's just like people say
Tomorrow's here so open up your eyes
And never hesitate

All I want and all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on

It makes me want to give you everything
Pick you up and take you home again
Hold you tight and think that now is then

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Open arms or crying eyes
Say hello or wave goodbye
Which one are you thinking of?

All I want, all I want to say
Is everything I feel from now on
