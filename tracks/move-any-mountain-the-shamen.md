I will not fail nor falter I shall succeed
My perception is altered I do believe
Faith is so strong now nothing shall bar my way
Firm conviction is no fiction this is my day

I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain

I walk so tall ascending I stand so high
Earth below me revolving above the sky
I feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
Shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind

Well you know that any mountain is capable of moving
The shamen and the new generation who are proving
You can be what you want to be
Let your soul and your body and your mind be free
One of a kind, we are all that
And going all the way is where I'm at
With delivery smooth like water from a fountain
That's why I can move any mountain move any mountain

I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain

Future feeling new sensation
Body is rockin' and the mind is reeling
And rolling racing changing motion
Flowing like a river into the ocean
Better get yourself ready for the next transition
'Cause the time is right for a new vibration
My vision one nation one tribe
One day'll come the might to move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain

I walk so tall ascending I stand so high
Earth below me revolving above the sky
I feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
Shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind

I can move move move any mountain
