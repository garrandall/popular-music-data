If I never do another thing today
Gonna teach myself to lie
If I never do another thing today
Gonna try to learn to cry
I've got to, live my life, my way
In every-thing today

Got - no - time to waste
My - hope - sink with haste
Watch-in' everybody
Going nowhere

All the little people with their little minds
Gonna say that I am crazy
All the little people with their little minds
Gonna say this boy is mad
Mmm, why should I, plan for the, future
Thats the future made plans for me

Got - no - time to waste
My - hope - sink with haste
Watch-in' everybody
Going nowhere

This - world - will not be
Ha-ppy until they
See - ev-erybody
Going nowhere

Oh
Oh yeah
Mmm, I've got to, live my life, my way
In every-thing today

This - world - will not be
Ha-ppy until they
See - ev-ery-body
Going nowhere

Got - so - much to do
I - can't - wait for you
This - world - is ruined
Going nowhere

Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
