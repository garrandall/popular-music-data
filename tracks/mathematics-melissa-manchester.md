You ask me how I can be so sure
My love for you will endure
Right here and now
I'll show you how I know

I just take this pen here in my hand
Set down and equation, understand
By the time we find the bottom line, you'll see
How much you mean to me

One plus one is two (it's mathematics)
No dividing me and you (the numbers don't add up)
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's as simple as can be (it's mathematics)
Like the sum of you and me (two times ecstatic)
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics (mathematics, oh mathematics)

Night after night, I'm staying up late
Working with my slide rule trying to calculate
The good you've done
What's to come of us
The tears, the talk
The fights, the fun
They're just parts of a puzzle adding up to one
Like a hand or heart
You're a part of me
Let me show you what I mean

One plus one is two (it's mathematics)
No dividing me and you (the numbers don't add up)
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's as simple as can be (it's mathematics)
Like the sum of you and me (two times ecstatic)
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics (mathematics, oh mathematics)

Once in your life you happened
To Be in the right place at the right time
Three little words
Can change your mind
Four the better (it's mathematics)

It's as simple as can be (it's mathematics)
Like the sum of you and me (two times ecstatic)
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics (oh mathematics)

One plus one is two (it's mathematics)
No dividing me and you (the numbers don't add up)
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's as simple as can be (it's mathematics)
Like the sum of you and me (two times ecstatic)
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics (its mathematics)

No dividing me and you (the numbers don't add up)
When I'm minus you
There's no, no solution

It's as simple as can be (it's mathematics)
Like the sum of you and me (two times ecstatic)
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
