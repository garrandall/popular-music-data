You know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around
You know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around
But as long as your loving beats your hogging
Little Girl I'll never put you down
You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong
I bring you home all my money
Except the little I keep for expense
And when I get home to you mama you always tell me
Ray you haven't got no sense


But on the other hand baby
You I can understand
But when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make me forget about everything


I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a cafe and eat
And when you argue all night long
I have to go down to the Den and sleep


But on the other hand baby
Your loving eases all my pain
And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything
