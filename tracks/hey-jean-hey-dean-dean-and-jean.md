Well, it's Saturday night
So let's have a party, hey, Jean
(Hey, hey, what do you say)

Let's get together and
Take out the record machine
(Ho, ho, what do you know)

I'd rather dance to a song that's groovy
I like it better than a western movie
I know the landlady wants the rent
So let's have a party
Though the money's all spent

And then we'll stomp, stomp
Stomp and stomp our feet
We're gonna clap, clap, clap
Let's start our own beat

And then we'll scream
Scream, scream on top of it
We'll make the best of it

I got your message and I know
What you mean, now Dean
(Hey, hey, know what you mean)
You forgot that you went out
And pawned our machine
(Ho, ho, pawned our machine)

The finance company man was here
He took the tv and he took our chairs
I bought a candle that burns real bright
In case they decide they want
To turn out the lights

We're gonna, call, call
Call, call all our friends
We're gonna let them know
When the party begins

And then we'll groove
Groove, groove, groove it a bit
We'll make the best of it

Hey Dean, you really caused a scene
(Hey, hey, caused a scene)
Hey Jean, now you know what I mean
(Ho, ho, know what I mean)

Everyone is having a ball
They're even dancing all out in the hall
The landlady says the music's too loud
But when she saw the fun we had
She joined the crowd

And she said stomp, stomp
Stomp, stomp your feet
Come on, let's clap, clap, clap
Let's start our own beat

And then we'll shout
Shout, shout on top of it
We'll make the best of it
