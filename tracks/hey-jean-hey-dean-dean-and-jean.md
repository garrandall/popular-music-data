DJ Victoriouz with me in the buildin'

Take my breath, you can keep it
Show my knees all their weakness
Hey Eileen, yeah
I think I only need your love and a little Visine
Seemed like we were hittin' every green light
Smokin' light green, yeah
And we fight the wind in Malibu
And the lights down on the avenue
That can't change as fast as you can change scene
Just a girl chasing that California dream
Tryna find her James Dean

And I think I might've found heaven in your smile
And hope down in your heart
If I could just hold you for a while
Well, then that would be a start
But I've seen love off in your eyes
In eyes that I can trust
And I think I found forever in the two of us
Oh, but you'd probably fuck up
Yeah, you'd probably

Break my heart, hate to fix it
Bring me down in your quicksand
Hey Eileen, yeah, uh
You know I've been thinkin' 'bout your love since you turned nineteen, yeah
I really think I need you feelin' loose, laying in them tight jeans
You're the one I need the most
I see your sins, I see your ghost
I think I see an angel

'Cause I found heaven in your smile
And hope down in your heart
If I could just hold you for a while
Well, then that would be a start
But I've seen love off in your eyes
In eyes that I can trust
And I think I found forever in the two of us
Oh, but you'd probably fuck up

Hey Eileen
Hey Eileen
I think I only need your love and a little Visine
Hey
