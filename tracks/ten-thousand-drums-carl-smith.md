Waiting, waiting, for the Red Coats to come
But all I hear in my frozen ears is ten thousand drums
Ten thousand drums


Johnny, Johnny, don't be afraid
We can whip those Red Coats setting in the shade
Setting in the shade


We've got the best of all the rest in General Washington
And when we meet those Red Coats, watch them Red Coats run
Throwing down their drums
Throwing down their drums


Listen, listen, Johnny better get your gun
'Cause there ain't wooden soldiers behind ten thousand drums
Behind ten thousand drums


Running, running, Johnny watch them run
We finally whip those Red Coats, finally stop those drums
We stopped ten thousand drums


We're the best of all the rest us Yankee son-of-a-guns
We can tell our mammy's how we made them run
Throwing down their drums
Throwing down their drums
We're the best of all the rest us Yankee son-of-a-guns
We can tell our mammy's how we made them run
Throwing down their drums
Throwing down their drums
Ten thousand drums
