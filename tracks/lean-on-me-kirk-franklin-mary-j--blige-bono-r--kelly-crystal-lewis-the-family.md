 Oooooohhh


 
This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
 Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
 You can lean on me


There's a man (oh yes)
Standing on the corner
He has no home
He has no food
And his blue skies are gone (yes it is)
Can't you hear him cryin' out

 
And there's a girl
Searching for a father and a friend
Praying that the storm someday will end
But instead of walking away
Open up your heart and say


 
I am here
You don't have to worry
I can see...
 I can see your tears
 
....your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
 Yes I will
 Friends are there to catch you when you fall
 Here's my shoulder
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me

 halleluia
 Ooooohhhhh
 Listen

 
Oh, there's a child
Who is sick and begging to be free
But there is no cure for his disease
He looks up to his mother and

 As she hold (holds), his hand (hand)
 Prayin' that someday
The sun will shine again
 And the pain?
 And the pain will end
 Pain will end....Come on

 I am here
 I am here
 You don't have to worry
 You don't have to worry
 I can see...
 I see...
 ....your tears
 ....your tears, yeah
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call
 Friends are there to catch you when you fall
 I'm your friend and I'll catch you when, when, when you fall
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me


 
Tell me, how can I, how can I love Jesus
When I've never seen His face
 Yeah, I see you dying
 And I turn and walk away

 So hold my hand
 Oooooohhhhh
 Let me take you to a friend of mine
 He's waiting just to ease your troubled mind
 Yeah, yeah, He loves you more than you'll ever know
 'Stead of walking away
 Open up
 Open up your heart and say
 Come on


 I am here
 I am here
 
You don't have to worry
I can see your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
 Alleluia
 Aaaaaaah
 When you call, friends will be there to catch you when, catch you when you fall
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
 Thank you Jesus, yeah
 OhYeah, oh yeah

 
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
 You can lean on me
 Lean on me, yeah, yeah
 You're my friend but you're also my brother
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
