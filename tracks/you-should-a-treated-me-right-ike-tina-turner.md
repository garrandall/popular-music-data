You shoulda treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
If yo loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
Cause all I wanted baby was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel that you were mine all mine
Before you started cheating
You were sweet and kind
Starting playing around
Wouldn't pay me no mind
But all I wanted was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel that you were mine all mine
Now that I've found me someone else
You say you still want me and that you still care
But I don't believe that you've changed
If I tried you again it would be the same
You shoulda treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
If yo loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
Cause all I wanted baby was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel that you were mine all mine
Now that I've found me someone else
You say you still want me and that you still care
But I don't believe that you've changed
If I tried you again it would be the same
You shoulda treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
If yo loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
Cause all I wanted baby was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel that you were mine all mine
Oh why didn't you do it
You shoulda treated me
Oh you shoulda treated me right
Oh I want you to tell me baby
I want you to tell me
Tell me that you care
Oh come on, come on
Treat me right
I want you to hold me and tease me
Oh I want you to squeeze me
Oh come on
Hold me baby, tell me that you love me
Come on tell met hat you love me
I wanna hold you, I wanna squeeze you
Come on, come on
Hold me baby, tease me a little
Now squeeze me
Come on daddy make me feel wonderful
