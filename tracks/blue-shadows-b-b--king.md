Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day

The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to try

Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone

So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price
