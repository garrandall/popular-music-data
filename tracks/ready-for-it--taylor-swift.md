Knew he was a killer
First time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta

I see how this is gonna go
Touch me, and you'll never be alone
Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams, ah
You should see the things we do, baby, mmh
In the middle of the night, in my dreams, yeah
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Me, I was a robber
First time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief then
He can join the heist
And we'll move to an island
And he can be my jailer
Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now
I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now, oh

I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams, ah
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams, yeah
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
So, baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin

Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Oh, baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin

I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams, yeah
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time

Are you ready for it?
