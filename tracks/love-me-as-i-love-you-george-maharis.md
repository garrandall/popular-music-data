(Love me, love me, ah ah ah, ah)
(Love me, love me, ah ah ah, ah)

Love me so tender
In sweet surrender
Love me as I love you
With all that's enduring
And reassuring
Love me as I love you

'Til there's no sunlight
Yours I will be
You'll be the one light
That's shining for me

I love you dearly
Love you sincerely
Love me as I love you
With tender emotion
Faith and devotion
Let's keep our love so new

Now and for always
Darling, in all way
Now and my whole life through
Place no one above me
Live just to love me
Love me as I love you

Love me as I love you

(Love me, love me, ah ah ah, I love you)
