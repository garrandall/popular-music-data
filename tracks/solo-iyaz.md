Well ya dun know it's ya boy I-Y-A-Z
Alongside the man J-R'a

I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I got to do it solo

See girl we used to be a team
Running the streets
Ya we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider
I was your provider
And now we separated in two

Oh baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With no way to get home

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it down low
I don't want it down low
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo)

'Cause I was so high
And now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo, solo)

You was the beat onto my top line
Put us together
And you have to hit the rewind
See, you gave me a purpose
Now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airways
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go, but you did
Yeah, you did

Oh baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With no way to get home

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it down low
I don't want it down low
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo)

'Cause I was so high
And now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo, solo)

I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
Oh no (oh no)

I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't ever wanna let your love go
Whoa
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it down low
I don't want it down low
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo)

'Cause I was so high
And now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo, solo)
