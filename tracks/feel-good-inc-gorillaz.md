Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.

(change) shake it (change), shake it (change), shake it (change), feel good.
(change) shake it (change), shake it (change), shake it (change), feel good.

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack.
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free.

You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no.

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand.
Take it all in on your stride.
It is ticking, falling down.

Love forever. Love is free.
Let's turn forever, you and me.
Windmill, windmill for the land.
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats.
Lining them up like ass cracks.
Lay these ponies at the track.
It's my chocolate attack.

Shit, I'm stepping in hotter this year.
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year.
Watch me as I gravitate.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

Yo, we gon' ghost town,
This Motown.
With your sound
You're in the blink.
Gon' bite the dust.
Can't fight with us.
With your sound
You kill the Inc.

So don't stop, get it, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar head.
And watch the way I navigate.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand.
Take it all in on your stride.
It is ticking, falling down.

Love forever. Love is free.
Let's turn forever, you and me.
Windmill, windmill for the land.
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, shit it, get it.
Peep how your captain's in it.
Feel good
Steady, watch me navigate.
Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Feel good

Don't stop, shit it, get it.
Peep how your captain's in it.
Feel good
Steady, watch me navigate.
Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Feel good

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
