Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you.
Signed with a home tattoo,
Happy Birthday to You was created for you

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces

Oh, it'll take a little time,
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Lost in a snow filled sky,
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside.
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry...

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love?

(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
