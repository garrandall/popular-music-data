Bizz-a-bah, Bizz-a-bah
Bizz-a-biz-a-beel-a-bah
Bah-bah, Bizz-a-bah Bum

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Woot-woot-woot-woot
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
And I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

Is it wetter under water if you're there when it rains?
Is it shorter to New York than it is by plane?
Bought a new lawnmower cause I had to cut the grass
Got ten dollars off cause I took it in the ass

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Biz-a-bah Biz-a-bow
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
And I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

I drove my Cadillac to Vegas to satisfy my lust
Wheeling - dealing, left old Vegas on a Grey-Hound bus
I sure didn't set the woods on fire while I was there
But remember only forest fires prevent bears

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Woot-woot-woot-woot
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
Lord I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

The poverty war will be over when I begin to fight
If it took a dime to go round the worl I couldn't get out of sight
I don't mind to take the girls out if they don't mind to go dutch
Makes me feel like a million dollars, and I bet I ain't worth half the much!

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Woot-woot-woot-woot
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
Lord I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

Oh crazy, man - I'm a nut
