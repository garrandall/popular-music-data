yeah I'm chillin on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin in the console.
Memory Lane up in the headlights.
got me reminiscing on the good times
said I'm turnin' off the real life drive and that's right
hittin easy street on mud tires


back in the day Potts' farm was the place to go
load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
light the bon fire , then call the girls
king in the can, and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
better watch out for the boys in blue
and all this small town he said she said
it aint as funny how rumors spread
like i know somethin ya'll dont know
man this shit is gettin old
man mind your business watch your mouth
before i have to knock your loud ass out
no time for talkin ya'll aint listenin
them old dirt road is what ya'll missing


yeah I'm chillin on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin in the console.
Memory Lane up in the headlights.
got me reminiscing on the good times
said I'm turnin' off the real life drive and that's right
hittin easy street on mud tires


I sit back and think about them good ole days
the way we were raised and our southern ways
we like corn bread and biscuits
and if its broke round here we fix it
see i can take ya'll where you need to go
down to my hood or back in them woods
we do it different round here thats right
but we sure do it good and we do it all night
so if you really wanna know how it feels
to get off the road and truck with four wheels
jump on in tell ya friends
that well be raisin hell where the black top ends


yeah I'm chillin on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin in the console.
Memory Lane up in the headlights.
got me reminiscing on the good times
said I'm turnin' off the real life drive and that's right
hittin easy street on mud tires


I was brought up in a small town in North Georgia
raised on southern baptist morals
in a front row pew for the Sunday roll call
now everybody praise the lord
i grew up learned how to hunt and fish
bust a 12 gauge pump and not miss
a life without work that's just a myth
never listen when they talkin shit
my dad taught me how to stand my ground
be a man boy and never back down
don't start up something but if he's talking trash
you better throw the first punch and whip his ass
now be somebody, make a name for yourself
life is hard, you go through hell
there comes a time when you've got to slow down
that's what we doing lets go


yeah I'm chillin on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin in the console.
Memory Lane up in the headlights.
got me reminiscing on the good times
said I'm turnin' off the real life drive and that's right
hittin easy street on mud tires
