I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away

I must follow him (follow him)
Ever since he touched my hand I knew
That near him I always must be
And nothing can keep him from me
He is my destiny (destiny)

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow
He'll always be my true love
My true love, my true love
From now until forever
Forever, forever

I will follow him (follow him)
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my arms

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow
He'll always be my true love
My true love, my true love
From now until forever
Forever, forever

I will follow him (follow him)
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my arms

And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow
