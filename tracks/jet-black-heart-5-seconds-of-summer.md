Everybodyâs got their demons
Even wide awake or dreaming
Iâm the one who ends up leaving
Make it okay

See a war I wanna fight it
See a match I wanna strike it
Every fire Iâve ignited
Faded to grey

But now that Iâm broken
Now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

'Cause Iâve got a jet black heart
And thereâs a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

Now Iâm holding on for dear life
Thereâs no way that we could rewind
Maybe thereâs nothing after midnight
That could make you stay

But now that Iâm broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

'Cause Iâve got a jet black heart
And thereâs a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

The blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
Letâs forget who we are
And dive into the dark
As we burst into color
Returning to life

'Cause Iâve got a jet black heart
And thereâs a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

The blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
(To start again)
Let's forget who we are
And dive into the dark
