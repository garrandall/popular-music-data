Woman, why must you leave me
I don't wanna be lonely no more
Can't you see you
Take a piece of me
Every time you go

So, lover
Let me down easy
Won't you please
Let me down slow

Cause your loving, it's just
Like a cold, cold wind
And it keeps on
Blowing at my skin

Woman, why don't you come in
You could leave in the morning
Don't you know you're
Breaking me slowly
Every time you go

So, lover, won't you
Let me down easy
Won't you please
Let me down slow

Don't you know your loving
It's just like a cold, cold wind
And it keeps on blowing
Blowing at my skin

Oh, lover, won't you
Let me down easy
Won't you please
Let me down slow

I want you to know your loving
It's just like a cold, cold wind
And it keeps on blowing
Blowing at my skin

Don't you know it
Keeps on blowing
Blowing at my skin
