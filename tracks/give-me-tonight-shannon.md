Tell me, tell me,
Tell me, tell me,


I don't pay attention to my rear view
Heard all of the rumors and what have you
Steady thinking that they really know you
But they don't, they don't
If I flip the camera on you
Had to see you from a different angle
You probably wouldn't recognize you
You won't, you won't


'Cause when I'm giving you all my heart, my soul
You tell me it's not enough
When I'm looking for something soft and sweet
You're giving it to me rough
One minute you build me up, me up
Next minute you let me fall
So, baby, don't leave me on
Baby, just turn me on


Tell me, tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me,
Tell me how you want me tonight
Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight


You want me half naked in stilettos
Hanging from the shower rod in the bathroom
I shouldn't have do that just to have you
So I won't, I won't
I just wanna really know what gets you
Often wonder why you gotta go so hard
When I'm not the one you're into
But you know you are


'Cause when I'm giving you all my heart, my soul
You tell me it's not enough
When I'm looking for something soft and sweet
You're giving it to me rough
One minute you build me up, me up
Next minute you let me fall
So, baby, don't lead me on
Baby, just turn me on


Tell me, tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me,
Tell me how you want me tonight
Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight


'Cause you don't know
Don't even know the half
Just take your time
Get to know who I am
'Cause you can have it your way
But I need to know you deserve it
When I look in your face
Just tell me which way you want it


Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me,
Tell me how you want me tonight
(I need you to tell me)
Tell me how you want me
(I need to tell me you want me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight

Tell me, tell me
Tell me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me
Tell me, tell me


Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me, oh, tell me
