Standing here lookin' out my window
My nights are long and my days are cold 'cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now but I can't let go


Every day, I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you


Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you


Driving 'round, thought I saw you pass me
My rear-view mirror's playing tricks on me 'cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
'Cause my loneliness got the best of me and my heart's so weak


Every day, I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that you're everything I need and more
If only I could find you


Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you
Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I'm, I'm missing you


Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the one without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you
Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the one without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you
Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the one without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
