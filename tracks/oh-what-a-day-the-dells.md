The sun, the moon and the stars
They make the wind blow
It took me twenty years to understand
Lost to me are how the lives of friends go
Like autumn leaves in Oklahoma wind
But it made me strong to be on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then
In the colour of the evening
Drunken in a barroom
With a fan turning
I've come to miss a few

This afternoon was cloudy and the rains came
Third day of my first day San Miguel
Seems lately that I'm doubling as Storm bait
I've been followed like a shadow through the dell
But it made me strong to be on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then
In the colour of the evening
Drunken in a barroom
With a fan turning
I've come to miss a few

Dear friends and relations
See what I have done
I've gathered all my fingers in one place
They breathe a breath that's deadly stale
Since they tooled a song for me
I guess mechanics never really set the pace
'Cause I'm back and I'm strong
I'm here on my own
It never did me no harm
To live all alone
Oh, but now and then
In the colour of the evening
Drunken in a barroom
With a fan turning
I've come to miss a few

The sun, the moon and the stars
They make the wind blow
It took me twenty years to understand
But lost to me are how the lives of friends go
Like autumn leaves in Oklahoma wind
Oh, but now and then
It's in the colour of the evening
Drunken in a barroom
With a fan turning
I'll come to miss a few
