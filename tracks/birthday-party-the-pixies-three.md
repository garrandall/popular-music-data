Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!

Gonna have a birthday party
Everybody's invited
Janie, Jimmie and Artie
Gonna make a night of it
Come on, come along
Tonight is the night

Got a whole lot of presents
And a beautiful cake
Gonna blow out the candles
Then a wish I will make
Help me celebrate, don’t be late
Tonight it’s a date

I got the latest records we all know
And we can dance to the radio
I thought that everything would turn out right
Just walk down my street to the party lights
Come on, come along
Tonight is the night

I got the latest records we all know
And we can dance to the radio
I know that everything will turn out right
Just walk down my street to the party lights

Gonna have a birthday party
Everybody’s invited
I can wait ‘til we start it
Cause I’m so excited
Come on, come along
Tonight is the night
Happy Birthday to...
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
