I know she's got love
But she's a tease, she won't please
Cause she won't give it out to no one

She'll smile and she'll wave
As she walks down the street
Lookin' sweet Saturday in the warm sun

Hey little girl you're so lovely
Will you forget or think of me?

I know she's got love
And she sends me above
And I can't get her out of my mind

If I could let me see
Because love I believe in
It's something that's so hard to find

I know she's got love
When I see her she frees me
I can't see nothing but her face

Anything goes
But she'll turn up her nose
Let me fall through the stars such a cold face

Hey little girl you're so lovely
Will you forget or think of me?

I know she's got love
And she sends me above
And I can't get, can't get
Can't get her out of my mind

I know she's got love
And she sends me above
And I can't get her out of my mind

If I could let me see
Because love I believe in
It's something that's so hard to find
