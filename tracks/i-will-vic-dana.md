Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me? 
Little alter boy, for I have gone astray
What must I do to be holy like you? 
Little alter boy ,oh, let me hear you pray

Little alter boy, I wonder could you ask your lord
Ask him, alter boy, to take my sins away
What must I do to be holy like you? 
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray

Lift up your voice and send a pray above
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love
Now I know my life has been all wrong
Lift my your voice and help a sinner be strong

Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me? 
Could you tell our lord I'm gonna change my ways today? 
What must I do to be holy like you? 
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray
Little alter boy please let me hear you pray!
