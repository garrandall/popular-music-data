Sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can live your life lonely
Heavy as stone
Live your life learning
And working alone
Say this is all you want
But I don't believe that it's true
'Cause when you least expect it
Waiting round the corner for you

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh

You can live a life of luxury
If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want

You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh

I know it sounds ridiculous, but speaking from experience
It may seem romantic, and that's no defense
Love will always get to you

Sooner or later, sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you?

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
(Oh)

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Oh ooh
