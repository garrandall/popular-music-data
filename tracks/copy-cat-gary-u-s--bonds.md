Hey, little copy cat
I think you ought to know that
Copy cats just don't last long
And they'll soon have to go
Well, I said, yeah
Yeah, yeah, little copy cat
Why do you copy me
Why can't you find
A style of your own
And, baby, just let me be
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little copy cat
Just who do you think you are
You copy everything I do
Right down to my jaguar
And then I said, yeah
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Chubby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Bobby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
They can copy his song now
They may kinda get his moves
(Tell everybody now)
But you won't last for very long
(Cause you just can't copy my groove)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, little copy cat
I think you ought to know that
Copy cats just don't last long
And they'll soon have to go
Come on, I said, yeah
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Bobby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Chubby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
They can copy his song now
They may kinda get his moves
(Tell everybody now)
But you won't last for very long
(Cause you just can't copy my groove)
I said, yeah, yeah
Yeah, little copy cat
I think you ought to know that
Copy cats just don't last long
And they'll soon have to go
I'm talking bout Chubby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Bobby
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Leon
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Freddie
(Yeah, little copy cat)
I'm talking bout Curtis
(Yeah, little copy cat)
Trying to cop my style
(Yeah, little copy cat)
They're trying to drive me wild now
(Yeah, little copy cat)
They're trying to take my place
(Yeah, little copy cat)
But don't you know, it's a disgrace
(Yeah, little copy cat)
You try to get my soul, yeah
(Yeah, little copy cat)
But I got control
(Yeah, little copy cat)
Cause I got Daddy G
(Yeah, little copy cat)
That's the man for me now
(Yeah, little copy cat)
Blow, Daddy, yeah
(Yeah, little copy cat)...
