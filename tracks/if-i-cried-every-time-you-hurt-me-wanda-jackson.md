If I'd cry every time you hurt me
I'd be cryin' all the time
If I made a scene each time you were mean
We'd be quarrellin' all the time

But I don't cry and I don't get mad
I try to take the good with the bad
If I'd cry every time you hurt me
I'd be cryin' all the time

Now and then you say you love me
I try to believe you do
Then you turn right around and hurt me
Like I was nothing to you

But I love you so and I'll stay somehow
My tears won't flow and my head won't bow
If I'd cry every time you hurt me
I'd be cryin' all the time
