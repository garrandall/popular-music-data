See girls every day
(I see girls every day)
But I just look away
(But I just look away)

I'm saving all my love for you
(I'm saving all my love for you)

I want you here in my heart
(I want you here in my heart)
Until you're in my arms
(Until you're in my arms)

??????

So pledge your love to me
Through all eternity

I love you with every
Beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart

I love you with every
Beat of my heart, girl
I love you
