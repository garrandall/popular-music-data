What up, world? It's your boy, just one of the guys down here. Well, I could be more specific. Uh, I'm a human, and I just wanted to, you know, for the sake of all of us earthlings out there, just wanted to say:


We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home


Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge


Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?


I'm a lion cub, and I'm always getting licked (Meow!)


How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo!)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)


I'm a fat, fucking pig


I'm a common fungus


I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole


I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up


And I'm Kanye West


We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth


Ba-dum-da-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead


We're just some rhinos, horny as heck


I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?


Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you


I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk


What the fuck? I'm a clam!


I'm a wolf. Howl!


I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut


And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (Yah)
Giddee-up, let's ride


I'm HPV, don't let me in


I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute


We love you, India


We love you, Africa


We love the Chinese


We forgive you, Germany


Earth, it is our planet (It's our planet)
We love the Earth (We love the Earth), it is our home (Home)
We love the Earth, it is our planet (It is our planet)
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth


I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the Internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)


Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet


Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live


Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum


ì°-ì°-ì°ë¦¬ë ì§êµ¬ë¥¼ ì¬ëí´ì


Amamos la tierra


æä»¬ç±å°ç


(We love you, we love you)
C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)


Have you ever been to Earth?


Everyone who's listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here


Are we gonna die?


You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not gonna lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out there who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid


Unless we get our shit together now




Guys, everybody look into whatever the fuck Leonardo DiCaprio is always pushing, 'cause I feel like that guy knows more about... the Earth and how we're fuckin' it up than... anybody!
If the aliens did come, we should definitely send Leo as our guy, our rep
In fact, the profits that come along with the streams and the sale of this song are going right into the Earth
Let's raise some money for charity
Any words, Leo?


This might be my favorite song ever
It's awesome


Wow
Thanks, Leo


We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
(Oh oh oohah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Woo, hoo, hoo!)


(Guys, thank you so much)
