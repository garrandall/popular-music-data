Ooooh...
You might not ever get rich
But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch
There ain't no telling who you might meet
A moviestar or maybe even an Indian chief

Working at the car wash
Working at the car wash, yeah
Come on and sing it with me, car wash
Sing it with the feeling now, car wash yeah

Come some of the work get's kind of hard
This ain't no place to be if you planned on being a star
Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you act a fool

At the car wash, woooh
Talking about the car wash, yeah
Come on y'all and sing it for me
Car wash, woh, car wash yeah

(Work and work) Well those cars never seem to stop coming
(Work and work) Keep those waxin' machines humming
(Work and work) My fingers to the bone
(Work and work) Keep up, I can't wait till it's time to go home

Hey, get your car washed today
Fill up and you don't have to pay
Come on and give us a play
(Working at, working at the)

Car wash
Talking about the car wash yeah
Car wash yeah
Come on y'all and sing it with me
Car wash
Sing it with feeling
Car wash yeah 

Wowowoh
Those cars never seem to stop coming
Keeps those rags and machines coming
Let me tell you it's always cool,
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you, act the fool
