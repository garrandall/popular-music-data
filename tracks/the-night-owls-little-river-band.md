There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's dressed to kill
He's a night owl

Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling
To belong, she's crying in the night
Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling
Stay up till dawn until the night is gone

What will become of the restless kind
Where do they go when they've done their time
Wearing their hearts out on the line for all to see
Must be the gypsy in their soul
They have a need to rock and roll
They always will, they're out there still 
They're the night owls

Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling
To belong, she's crying in the night
Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling
Stay up till dawn until the night is gone

There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's out there still
He's a night owl

Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling
To belong, she's crying in the night
(The night goes on and on)
Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling
Stay up till dawn until the night is gone
