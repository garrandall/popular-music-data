Oh? hoo? hoo?
Oh? hey?

After spending my whole weekend
Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out
But I fight to raise my hand

And I get a little nervous
Watching day turn into night
Read another bedtime story
Before you turn out the light

Tuck me in (Mmm)
And hold me real right
That's the only way I'll know
Everything is gonna be alright

Tuck me in (Hm)
Before you tell me goodnight (Mmm? hm)
That's the only way I'll know (Oh)
Everything is gonna be just fine

You wonder why I get so nervous
Wonder why I get so scared
Friend of mine I used to hang with
Has an address way up there

She was minding her own business
Tryin' to have herself a little fun
And she never knew what hit her
She never saw tomorrow come

Tuck me in (Oh? oh? yeah? yeah? yeah?)
And hold me real right (Yeah, hey, yeah, hey)
That's the only way I'll know (That's the only way I'll know)
Everything is gonna be alright (Everything is gonna be alright)

Tuck me in
Before you tell me goodnight (Goodnight)
That's the only way I'll know
Everything is gonna be just fine

And I wake up in the middle, in the middle of the night
I just can't sleep so I hold my pillow tight
Counting backwards from a hundred, only get to ninety-nine
When I call out to you tuck me in one more time

Tuck me in, hold me tight
Don't let go until the morning light (Won't you)
Tuck me in, hold me tight
Don't let go until the morning light

Tuck me in (Tuck me in, yeah)
And hold me real right (Oh, no, no, no, no, oh?)
That's the only way I'll know (No, no, no, no)
Everything is gonna be alright (No, no)

Tuck me in (Where's my ring, yeah) hold me tight (Ho?)
Don't let go until the morning light
Tuck me in, hold me tight
Don't let go until the morning light (Tuck me in)

Tuck me in, hold me tight
