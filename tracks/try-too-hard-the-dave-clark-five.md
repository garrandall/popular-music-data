Whoa, can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they're trying so very hard to pull us apart
Well, we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on loving this way
But if they break us up, you know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me too

People talk and try to break us up
When we know they don't understand
Well, I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holding her hand

Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they're trying so very hard to pull us apart
Well, we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on loving this way
But if they break us up, you know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long, long time
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me too
