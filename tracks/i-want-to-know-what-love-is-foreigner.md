I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older


Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder


In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life


I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me


I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me


In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life


I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me


I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
(And I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(And I know) I know you can show me
Let's talk about love


I wanna know what love is (The love that you feel inside)
I want you to show me (And I'm feelin' so much love)
I wanna feel what love is (No, you just cannot hide)
I know you can show me (Yeah)


I wanna know what love is (Let's talk about love)
I want you to show me (I wanna feel)
I wanna feel what love is (And I know, and I know)
I know you can show me (Yeah)
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel)
I know you can show me
