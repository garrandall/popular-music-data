You got me so wild
How can I ever deny
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire


And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these


Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself


You got me so wild
Why should I be so surprised?
You got me so high
Don't you see it in my eyes?


And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself


They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself


Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
