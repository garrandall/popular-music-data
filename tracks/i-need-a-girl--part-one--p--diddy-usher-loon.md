Yeah, c'mon
I need a, I want a


I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life


Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks that romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Bonin' Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancy, to trips to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe it's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how it do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl, it's you and me


Now let's ride.....


I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life


Yo, you would I met a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And 'hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'm 'a keep her
'cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
You want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Wintertime, when the fall ends, Snow White.
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life


I need a girl...


I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life


I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'm 'a tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah


I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
