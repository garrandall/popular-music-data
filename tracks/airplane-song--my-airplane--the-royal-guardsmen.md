I can go for miles in my airplane
Have a lot of smiles in my airplane
I can go up - I can get down
But I can't get to you
If you don't want me around
In my airplane

You could wear your flowers in my airplane
Laugh and talk for hours in my airplane
You can go from, and you can go to
And if you'll fly with me
Then I will fly to you
In my airplane

If I get my jet and set
Myself right on the runway of your city
You would not be there to meet me
You would not be there to greet me
That's a rhyme and a pity

We could go to Maine in my airplane
Chase away the rain in my airplane
We can go up - We can go down
But the way we're going now
We won't get off the ground
In my airplane

If I get my jet and set
Myself right on the runway of your city
You would not be there to meet me
You would not be there to greet me
That's a rhyme and a pity

We could go to Maine in my airplane
Chase away the rain in my airplane
We can go up - We can go down
But the way we're going now
We won't get off the ground
In my airplane
