When you need a friendly conversation
Or someone to tell your troubles to
I can help to ease your situation
Be the one to see your problems through
There's no need to suffer when you're lonely
If you need someone to comfort you

Just call me quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
Quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
Quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
I'll come running to you

When it seems you can't find the solution
For the little things that get you down
Promise that you'll make a resolution oh baby
To call me when you need someone around
There's no shame in asking for affection
Everybody needs it at sometime

Just call me quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
Quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
Quick, fast, in a hurry
And I'll come a running to you
I'll come running to you

Repeat last verse through till fade.
