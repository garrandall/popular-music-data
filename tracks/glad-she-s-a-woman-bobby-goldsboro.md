As she sit by the window
She's busy with work
But her mind isn't on
What she's doing

She thinks back to morning
The feeling she had
And she's glad she's a woman

And you can see the glow
On her face and in her eyes
You can see she's changing everyday
From the little girl I married
From a girl into a woman

And she's glad she's a woman

Late at night
When I'm sleeping
She'll tug at my side
Wake me up just to
Tell me she's happy

I put my hand on the life
She carries inside
Then she smiles
And says, hello, daddy

And my heart could almost burst
From the love she brings to me
I can see she's changing everyday
From the little girl I married
From a girl into a woman

And I'm glad she's a woman
