See the way he walks down the street
Watch the way he shuffles his feet
My, he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by
He's my guy

When he holds my hand, I'm so proud
'Cause he's not just one of the crowd
Why is he always the one
To try the things they've never done?
Just because of that they say

He's a rebel and he'll never, never be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should
Just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love

He's always good to me
Always treats me tenderly
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no to me

If they don't like him that way
They won't like me, I'm sure, today
And I'll be standin' right by his side
When they say

He's a rebel and he'll never, never be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should
Just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share a love

He's always good to me
Good to him, I try to be
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no to me
Oh, he's not a rebel, no, no, no

He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no

He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no
