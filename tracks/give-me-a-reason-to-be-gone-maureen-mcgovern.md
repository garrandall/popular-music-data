I don't know what you want from me, baby,
But I've already given ev'rything I can
So, if my best isn't good enough,
Tell me and I'll understand
Baby

CHORUS:
Give me a reason to be gone
You know I believe in hangin' on
And I'll stay 'til you send me away
So, give me a reason to be gone

If you'd found someone else that you love more than me,
Tell me now, don't keep it inside
Don't sit there and wait 'til you hate me
At least let me leave with my pride
Baby

CHORUS

I know you're tryin' so hard not to hurt me
But you're only hurting me more
Just say the words, "I need you here"
And let me walk out the door

I don't know what you want from me, baby,
But I've already given ev'rything I can
So, if my best isn't good enough,
Tell me and I'll understand
Baby

CHORUS

Give me a reason to be gone
Give me a reason to be gone
Give me a reason to be gone
Give me a reason to be gone
