Here we are, the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out,
It could mess up both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
'Cause soon as I look at you, it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can let them know,
No, no, no, we can't leave a trace

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
We should't be together
But we can't let it go, no, no
'Cause we love each other so

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're OK
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right?
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives, just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there or fall

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go 'cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real, so real, so real

You and me, are we fair?
Is this cruel or do we care?
Can they tell what's in our minds?
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love, we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful so that no one will know

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real, so real, so real, so real
