Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
Long lived: what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore


And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch


I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that
Step outta line and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday


And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch


Blinded by your sacred faded past times, only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance to prove that your arrogance is
Stronger than you'll ever beâ€¦ it's stronger than you can be


And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch


Oh, bitch!
