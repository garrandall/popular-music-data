There's a place I belong
Call  it here Call it home
Let  the silence take me away
Send me back to you again

There's a dream I dreamed before
Always  shine forever more
Let  the memory show the way
I am here with you again

I'm  the one who let you go
First to leave the last to know
I could wish you back to me
Dreams are made for fools like me

The  the new in when I'm over
All the tears a little wiser
I'll be here

Cause I'm the one who let you go
First to leave the last to know
I could wish you back to me
Dreams are made for fools like me
