Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations


Oh this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get


So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication


Oh this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get


Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI


Oh this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah


Oh this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get


Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
