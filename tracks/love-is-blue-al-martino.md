Blue, blue
My world is blue
Blue is my world
Now I'm without you

Gray, gray my
Life is gray
Cold is my heart
Since you went away

Red, red
My eyes are red
Crying for you
Alone in my bed

Green, green
My jealous heart
I doubted you
And now we're apart

When we met
How the bright sun shone
Then love died
Now the rainbow is gone

Black, black
The nights I've known
Longing for you
So lost and alone

Gone, gone
The love we knew
Blue is my world
Now I'm without you

When we met
How the bright sun shone
Then love died
Now the rainbow is gone

Black, black
The nights I've known
Longing for you
So lost and alone

Blue, blue
My world is blue
Blue is my world
Now I'm without you
