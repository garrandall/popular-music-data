When people see us walking together
Anyone can tell it's right, right
It couldn't be any righter if we tried
And when we're safe in each other's arms
Anyone can tell it's real, real
I think that you'll agree that baby, we're forever

So keep holding on to me
And I'll keep holding on to you
And there ain't no age, there ain't no time
We can't last through

'Cause us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
Like perfect harmony
Baby, it was meant to be

Us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
For all the world to see
We'll last for eternity

And when people try to pull us apart
We'll just laugh and turn away, hey
How can they destroy what love's created

So keep holding on to me
And I'll keep holding on to you
And this dream of ours
Will always be brand new

'Cause us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
Like two peas in a pod
Baby, we were blessed by God

And if the world starts to tumble down
We will be our guide
It'll never let us down

So keep holding on to me
And I'll keep holding on to you
And there ain't no age, there ain't no time
We can't last through, oh

'Cause us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
Like perfect harmony
Baby, it was meant to be

Us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
For all the world to see
We'll last for eternity

Us and love, us and love
We go together, we go together
Like perfect harmony
Baby, it was meant to be

Us and love, us and love
Oh... oh...
For all the world to see
We'll last for eternity
