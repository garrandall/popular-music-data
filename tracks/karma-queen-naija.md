I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Got you some bread, and start treating me bogus

Talking about you wanted something new
Like I wasn't good enough for you
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view

Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side
No, I guess not, I guess not
Cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you what you wanted is what you got now

So you don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

You don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you, it really messed my head up
Had me looking in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishing that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram, damn

And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth
Maybe maybe I should have loved me first
Maybe maybe I should have loved me first

So you don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

You don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

What goes around, it comes around
What goes around, it comes around, yeah
