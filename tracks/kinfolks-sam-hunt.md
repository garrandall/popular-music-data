I saw you goin' by, I had to say, "Hello"
And I don't mean to pry but
Girl, I gotta know, what is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before?

You know I ain't never had a type
Having a type takes two
But I know what I like
And you're the only one of you
You're something else
And I know we just met but

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
To my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown
Where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it
But honey you got my hopes up
And I'm thinkin' that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

I wanna take you home
Not just take you home tonight
Get Joanie on the phone
She'll leave us on a light
I wanna see the way you look up under all those stars

You're gonna be the talk
Word's gonna get around
They'll tell you how they thought I'd
Never settle down
Out on the porch
Ain't it funny the way things change

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
To my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown
Where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it
But honey you got my hopes up
And I'm thinkin' that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

I don't wanna wait around for the right time

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
To my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown
Where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it
But honey you got my hopes up
And I'm thinkin' that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

And I'm thinkin' that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
