One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
('Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you're in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (hell yeah!)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff


It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom


Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do


It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode


You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling (yeah, yeah)


Fallin' back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic, like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah!) So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)


Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit
That's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit I'ma have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better


Like this, that and this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode


You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling (yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling (yeah, yeah)
