Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod
When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

Oh, Mary, did you know
Mary, did you know, oh

Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Oh, Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect lamb
And the sleeping child you're holding
He is the great, the great I Am?

Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
