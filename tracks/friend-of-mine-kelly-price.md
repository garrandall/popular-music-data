She was a friend of mine
She left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine
She used what she knew
She lied, cheated, and left me confused


I feel so lost
Don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend
I never could have thought it could be
You were someone
Someone I really thought I could trust
But my man, you laid and I'm betrayed




Thicker than blood
Wherever there was me there was you
My all was your all
But that wasn't enough for you
You had to see
And tried to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, In my bed
Betrayed by my best friend




I want to know why (why?)
You were my friend (why?)
I gave you all I had (why?)
Everything, everything that you want (why?)
Ooohhh!! (why?)
You were my friend (why?)
Oh! My sister (why?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (why?)




You were, you were
How could you do this to me
You were my best friend
And everything you needed, I gave you everything
You left me alone
You lied, you cheated
Every little thing I had, yeah yeah yeah
You used all you knew
You liar, and you're a cheater
How could you do it?
How could you do it?
Yeah, yeah, you're a liar and you're a cheater
You were my friend, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, you're a liar
