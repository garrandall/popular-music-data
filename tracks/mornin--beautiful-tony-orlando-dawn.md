Mornin' Beautiful
It's morning and you're beautiful and
I just can't believe I'm laying here with you, girl
In my wildest dreams I've never thought I'd ever find
That one day I would wake up beside an angel

Mornin' Beautiful
Hey, look outside, the sun's a-shining
Every cloud is rolling back for you
You lay sleeping and my heart beats like the silver moon
I hear violins and angel voices singing

Mornin' Beautiful
Wake up, I've got some news to tell you
I'm in love with you and I want you to know girl
That I think you are the greatest love in all the world
And that you alone can bring my world together

I will never let you go, no
I love you, babe
More than you'll ever know
I love you, babe
And after lonely nights have fallen
You'll wake up and hear me calling
Mornin' Beautiful

In my wildest dreams I've never thought I'd ever find
That one day I would wake up beside an angel

Mornin' Beautiful
It's morning and you're beautiful and
I just can't believe I'm laying here with you, girl
Mornin' Beautiful
Hey, look outside, the sun's a-shining
Every cloud is rolling back for you
Mornin' Beautiful
