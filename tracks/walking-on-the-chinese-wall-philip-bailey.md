Walking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese Wall

Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Butterfly, spread
Your painted wings
From an answer
From the Ching

By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh, yeah
Watching for the coins to fall

(On the Chinese Wall)
Butterfly, spread your wings
From an answer from the Ching

(Watching for the coins to fall)
Blue red silk on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest, oh, no

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall...
