I'd rather be lonely
Than to lose you
I'd rather be blue
Than to be all alone

'Cause if you leave me
My heart would grieve me
And my poor heart, no, no
Just couldn't stand the pain

Though your love
Has got me in captivity, yeah
Yet if you should leave me
I know I would die

Yeah, in other words
In other words
Listen, I just couldn't take it, baby
I couldn't stand
For you to say goodbye

Now, I'm just a prisoner
For your good loving
I'm just a slave
Bound and chained

No, no, I don't wanna ever be free
So please don't ever leave me
For my poor heart
Just couldn't stand the pain

Though your love
Oh, yeah, got me in captivity
Yet if you should leave me
I know I would die

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In other words, in other words
I just couldn't take it, baby
I couldn't stand, ho
To say goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just a prisoner, oh
For your good loving, yes, I am
Listen, I'm just a slave
Bound and chained

No, no, no, no
I don't ever wanna be free
Oh, no, so don't ever leave me
For my poor heart
Just couldn't stand the pain

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just a prisoner
Just a prisoner

I done tried
I done tried and
I can't live without him
I can't live without him
I can't live without him
