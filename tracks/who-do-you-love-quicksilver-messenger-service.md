I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire, I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house by the road side, made out of rattlesnake hide
I got me a chimney that's made on the top, made from a human skull
Come on, take a little walk with me, now tell me who do you love?

Who do you love now? Who do you love?
Who do you love now? Who do you love?

Come on Arlene, take me by the hand, let me know that you understand me
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who do you love?

Ride nine times on the midnight train through the fire and the cold dark rain
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who-who-who...?

A graveyard hand in a tombstone mind, just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who-who...?
