Iâm beaminâ


My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path Iâve traveled has immediate reaction
Canât you see that I am beaming? Iâll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh houseâs zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, itâs meant to keep you out (But)
Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound (âCause)
Freedom isnât found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldnât speak it out loud (But)
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow


Rey Mysterio flow, stayinâ clear
Of makeup-smeared hatinâ queers, makinâ clear this is spiritual
Though a spirit you owe, church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searchinâ for fire
Or titles, or tidal waves
Tie the game like a shot from outside when itâs 95 to 98
To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Boa constrictor, chokinâ (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)
Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Love, I get none, like sayinâ no to niggas
Hamiltonianâs loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (N-ggas!)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons wonât go away
I keep pressinâ like my phone is afraid
To be a star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say


Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doinâ this since super letters
So I canât spell and canât mail it out
If you canât feel, itâs too full, you canât peel it out
Showboatinâ at the show, but you canât sell it out
Iâm on the sea shepherd deck, helpinâ the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checkinâ themselves out
Tweeters in the trunk, helpinâ the twelves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes
Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes


Big up to whatâs been up, nigga
Pinups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollerinâ, âYeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app!â
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Havenât done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though
But it ainât no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ainât wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And Iâm beaminâ
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBAâd up from development leagues


Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever âLac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab âem)
You want the truth? Well, the truth is
This is it, pointinâ out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isnât it?
Lizard king loafers on swole when Iâm kickinâ it
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold


Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggasâ shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me yâallâs
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn âtil the dawn
Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song
âCause when you feel it, and it make yoâ ass chill and calm
Payinâ more than just attention for that glass Iâm sippinâ on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kiddinâ, ma? Scratch backs, bringinâ out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchenâs warm
Back to attendinâ business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dippinâ all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period


I know what youâre thinkinâ, thinkinâ I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ainât beaminâ, âcourse I should be on this song
Yeah, Iâm a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, Iâm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong
Didnât want me to shine, now we sharinâ the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the remains, and it ainât even how
That Verizon flow, are you hearinâ me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was sayinâ my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missinâ the art
So Iâm drawinâ the line, and Iâm crossinâ the Ts
And Iâm dottinâ my Iâs, barely catchinâ my Zâs
But Iâll be good by the morninâ, on my global grind like JoJo
They be lookinâ at what Iâm puttinâ on and, so fly, so fresh at the Soho
Most niggas donât know though, they can catch me on the first flight
Been workinâ on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate


When people said I couldnât, I wouldnât, I made âem believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayinâ we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some people hate it, but I made it, so Iâm never concerned
About what they be talkinâ about, Iâve lived and Iâve learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because Iâm in control, meetinâ adjourned
I said, "Itâs Third Degree, yâall heard of we?
Iâm Dosage, have you heard of me?"
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say it doesnât matter to be much
I was on the Steppinâ Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when


Well, itâs B to the O, O to the B
You know itâs the flow, you know that itâs me, I flow to this beat
As easy as goinâ to the store and holdinâ receipts
And foldinâ âem neat, Iâm focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and youâll get ferociously beat
Speakinâ of ferociously beat, you know that girl âNique?
You know sheâs a freak, but anyway, back to what Iâm supposed to be
Sayinâ all over this beat, you know that we Gâs
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
Itâs the All City varsity, hard-headed squad
We played yâall spades, yâall handle yâall cards
But we ainât all odds, we just blaze, man
Yâall playinâ checkers in this game, this is chess, yâall pawns
