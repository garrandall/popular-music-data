When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need, won't you stand, stand by me

And if the sky we look upon
Should ever crumble and fall
And the mountains should fall to the sea
No I won't be afraid, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need, won't you stand, stand by me

Darlin', stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need, won't you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need, won't you stand, stand by me...
