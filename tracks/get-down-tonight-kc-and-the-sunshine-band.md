Baby, baby
Let's get together
Honey, honey, me and you
And do the things
Ah, do the things
That we like to do

Oh, do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

Baby, baby
I'll meet you
Same place, same time
Where we can all get together
And ease up our mind

Oh, do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, whoo

Get down tonight, hey
Do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight
Get down tonight, baby

Oh, do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, whoo
Get down tonight, hey

Do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, whoo
Get down tonight, baby

Get down, get down

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down, get down

Get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down tonight, baby

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down, get down

Get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down..
