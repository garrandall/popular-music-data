Just one look
I felt so I, I, I'm in love
With you
I found out
How good it feels
To have your love
Say you will
Will be mine
Forever and always
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one

I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
Til I can make you
Make you my own

Can't you see
That I really care
Without you
I'm nothin'
Just one look
And I knew
I'll get you some day



Just one look, that's all it took
Just one look
