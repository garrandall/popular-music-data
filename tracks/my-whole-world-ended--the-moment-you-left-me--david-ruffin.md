Last week my life had meaning
It was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothin', nothin' without you, baby
My whole world is incomplete
'Cause honey now, I can't see you no more
That was all that you said, baby
But you just might as well now
Placed a gun to my head, baby, baby, oh baby now

My whole world has ended
The moment you left me, oh baby
My whole world has ended
The moment you left me, oh baby

Did you ever mean those sweet things
That you used to say? (Did you mean it baby?)
Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden
And a little baby some day
Oh tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
Whatever changed your mind, baby?
I've asked myself these questions
Over a million times, baby, baby, oh baby now

My whole world has ended
The moment you left me, oh baby
My whole world has ended
The moment you left me, oh baby

My body is numb, I feel so sensitive to your touch
My life is so wasted, so wasted without you baby
I guess I loved you much too much
Oh baby, how can I face tomorrow
(When yesterday is all I see?)
I just don't wanna face tomorrow, baby
If you're not sharing it with me, baby, baby, oh baby now

My whole world has ended the moment you left me, oh baby
My whole world has ended the moment you left me, oh baby

My whole world has ended the moment you left me, oh baby
