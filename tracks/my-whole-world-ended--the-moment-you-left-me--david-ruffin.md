Last week my life had meaning
It was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothing, nothing without you baby
My whole world is incomplete
Cause honey I can't see you no more
That was all that you said baby
But you just might as well have placed a gun to my head
Baby, baby, oh why did you do it
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Yeah baby, honey, my whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby
Did you ever mean those sweet things
All that you use to say
Did you mean 'em baby
A lovely, lovely garden and a little baby someday
Oh tell me baby
Where did I go wrong, honey
Whatever changed your mind, baby
I've asked myself these questions over a million times
Baby, baby, oh baby
My whole world ended the moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby
Oh baby now my body is numb
I feel so senseless to the touch
My life is so wasted, so wasted without you
I guess I love you much too much
Oh baby how can I face tomorrow
When yesterday is all I see
I just don't want to face tomorrow
If you're not sharing it with me
Baby, baby oh tell me why my whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh yes it did, baby, baby
My whole world ended the moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground
Baby, I keep holding on, holding on
Although your love is gone, baby
