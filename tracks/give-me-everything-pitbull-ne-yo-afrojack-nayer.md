Me not working hard?
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo
That's right



Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight


Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til I have your love


Let's do it tonight


I want you tonight,
I want you to stay
I want you tonight


Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight


Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin'
Hustlers move aside
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my life, baby,
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But, I promise tonight
Dalé


Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight
And, baby, Ima make you feel so good, tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow



Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight


Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til I have your love


Let's do it tonight


I want you tonight, I want you to stay
I want you tonight


Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight


Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab 'em,
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it
Cause if you slip,
I'm gon' fall on top yo girl (hahaa)
What I'm involved with
Is deeper than the masons
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba
But I'm an American Idol
Get money like Seacrest

Put it on my life, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But, I promise tonight
Dalé


Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby Ima make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow



Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight


Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til I have your love


Let's do it tonight


I want you tonight, I want you to stay
I want you tonight


Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight


Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby Ima make you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow
