Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free
Stop playin' with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
Your making me, your making such a fool of me
I see you on the street and you walk on by
You're on the street I see when you're walking by
When you hold me in your arms you love me till I just can't see
So you choose to look the other way
Well I've got something to say...

Open your heart to me, baby
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
(open your heart I'll make you love me) 
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin' 
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
(ohh ohh ohh) 
Open your heart with the key
