Oh my God, you know


I'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight
Go deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight
'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When your gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin' through the crowd
Heaven on Earth, paradise for a price
It's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why


Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)


I'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home
Lovely, you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin' for rainy days
Uh, the lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise

As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible, uh, it's getting critical son
I'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo, you hit it right on the head
It's an endless adventure, two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever, infinite time we intertwine
Destiny, we fall in love by design
What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you, heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night

Come on now, a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man, give you half for a second
Then I'll give you the full plunge, uh
What you want? What you want? What you want?
Ice out infiltrates the scenery, nahmean
It's bananas ain't it
