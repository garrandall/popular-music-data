(Just be sincere to me)
(Just be sincere to me)
You say you love me
An I believe it's true
But there's something going down
It's all over town
Talk around's about you
Oh, I don't want to hear these things
Please say it's untrue
Please tell me darling
What the people say
Is not true about you
(Just be sincere to me)
(Just be sincere to me)
Now the talk is loud
It's all over town
It's driving my hopes into the ground
I ask you to explain to me
This hurt and pain
But your excuses are always the same
Oh, I don't want to hear these things
Please say it's untrue
Please tell me darling
What the people say
Is not true about you
(Just be sincere to me)
(Just be sincere to me)
Now I've had all that I can stand
I think you've filled your cup
I try to turn around the facts ever laid down
But two and two don't add up
Oh, don't think it's all right for you
To treat me this way
I'm down on my knees, every night
And I'm hoping you'll hear me pray
(Just be sincere to me)
(Just be sincere to me)
