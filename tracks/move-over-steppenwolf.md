Things look bad from over here
Too much confusion and no solution
Everyone here knows your fear
You're out of touch and you try too much

Yesterday's glory won't help us today
You wanna retire?
Get out of the way

The country needs a father
Not an uncle or big brother
Someone to keep the peace at home
If we can't get together
Look out for stormy weather
Don't make me pay for your mistakes
I have to pay my own

Yesterday's glory won't help us today
You wanna retire?
Get out of the way

I ain't got much time
The young ones close behind
I can't wait in line

If we can not wake you
Then we'll have to shake you
Though some say you'll only understand a gun
Got to prove them wrong
Or you will lose the battle
Don't you know we'll start a war
Which will be won by none

Yesterday's glory won't help us today
You wanna retire?
Get out of the way

I ain't got much time
The young ones close behind
I can't wait in line


Move over
Come on, Move Over

Repeat Chorus
