Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Yes don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll smother you with kisses 
When her birthday comes around
But as soon as she gets her presents
She'll down talk you all over over town
No don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds
Until you're all in hock
And then you'll come home one mornin'
And your key won't fit the lock
Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Well, one day she'll say that she loves you
The next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll call you every mornin'
Every mornin' noon and night
She'll call you in between times
Just to see if you're doin' alright
She'll ask to borrow five
And then she'll beg for ten
And baby that five and ten
You won't ever see again!

Man don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street
