Spending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do (like I do)
Though it hurts me so to let you know that I
Look in your eyes to let me know
How you feel
Let me know that love is really real
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love


Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, yeah, hey

Heaven knows that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey


Hey, when I look in your eyes
And all the years I see (I see)
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love


Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Hey, ah-ha, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hey, ah-ha
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Ay, I try it if you want me to
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah, ah, ah, ah
