I saw her dancin', dancin' in some smoke filled place, yeah;
I'll bet that I was the only one who watched her face
All night I never saw her smilin'
She didn't even try
You know for just a little while there
I saw a tear in her eye

I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance

I'll sit and watch her and wait 'till I can get her alone
Then I'll say "Baby, baby let me take you home
I wonder how it is to lover her
I toss and turn in my bed
The way she moves to the music
Can't get it out of my head

I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance

Dance for me baby, dance little girl
Wait for me baby, wait my little girl

I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance

I got to get it out of here
And put on her shoes
Yes, that's what I said

I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance
