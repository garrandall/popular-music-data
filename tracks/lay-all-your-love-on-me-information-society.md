You weren't jealous before we met
Now every woman you see is a potential threat
Now you're possessive, it isn't nice
You used to say that smoking was your only vice

But now it isn't true
Now anything's new
And all I've learned
Has overturned
What I think of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I used to think love was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
I still don't know what you've done to me
A grown-up boy should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied
I swallow my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all you love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
