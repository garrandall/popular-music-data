"...song, this is a very sad song, this next
Song we're gonna do
The song is so sad that sometimes I have to
Leave the stage and cry in the backstage a
Little bit while I'm singing this song
The reason this song is so sad because this
Story happened to me just a little while ago

(I sold my heart) I sold my heart to the junkman(I sold my heart) I sold my
Heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again
Now I swear it was a movie setting, baby I played my part
And all I wanted was a happy ending
But now I'm left with a broken heart
