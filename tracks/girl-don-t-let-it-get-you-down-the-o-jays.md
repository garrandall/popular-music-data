Don't let it get you down, girl
Don't let it get you down
I'll bring you back around, girl
I'll bring you back around

He broke your heart
And made you cry
He took your love
Then said goodbye

You live and you learn
Experience will teach you every time
I told you I'd be standing here
'Cause I'm the next in line

Don't you let it get you down, girl
Don't let it get you down
I'll bring you back around, girl
I'll bring you back around

He promised you
Security
But it was only
Fantasy

Here's my shoulder
It's for you to cry, to cry on
I offer you a true love
A love you can rely on

Don't let it get you down, girl
Don't let it get you down
I'll be standin' right there to bring you around, girl
I'll bring you back around

Here's my shoulder
It's for you to cry, to cry on
I offer you a true love
A love you can rely on

Don't let it get you down, girl
Don't let it get you down
I'll be standin' right there to bring you back around, girl
I'll bring you back around

He broke your heart and made you cry
Don't let it get you down
Here's my shoulder to cry on
Don't let it get you down

He took your love and said bye, bye-bye
Don't let it get you down, get you down
So I'm offerin' you true love
So don't let it get you down

He promised you security
Don't let it get you down
Everybody knows, everybody knows that you're too fine, too fine
Don't let it get you down
