If she should come to you
Be gentle
For she is very, very shy

Don't ever act unsentimental
She won't to stay then
She'll run far away then

If she should come to you
Remember that she'll
Believe your every word

And if she trusts you
She will give you her heart
So, remember if she comes to you

She's fashioned
From everything magic
Miraculous, marvelous love

Without her
Your world would be tragic
There'd be nothing but grieving
No laughter or joy or believing

If she should come to you
Be tender
You must take care
Or love will die

So understand her
And befriend her
Take my word
You must always defend her

Then when she comes to you
I'm certain she will stay
