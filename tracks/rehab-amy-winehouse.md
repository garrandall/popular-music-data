They tried to make me go to rehab
I said no, no, no.
Yes I been black, but when I come back
you wont know, know, know.

I ainât got the time
and if my daddy thinks im fine
Heâs tried to make me go to rehab
I wonât go, go, go.


Pharoahe Monch, lets go, get it, oh no no no no no I cant go go go to rehab youâd just be mad,
drunk in the lobby Pharoahe my just hurl place me with these snobby white girls.

12 step program Lindsay Lohan, cold and bitchy Nicole Ritchie, skin and bones so thin and see
through what the fuck we have Iâll feed you. Even, believe it anorexic wash their mouths with
antiseptic, no grey goose I wont except it, they say Pharoahe is to eclectic.

Prescription drugs, Anna Nicole Smith, silicosis is what I roll with, pass that hit, let me
roll 1, escape with Mary Kate Olsen.

E-tap take an extra Motrin, wash that down with a Molson golden sit me here with Britney
Spears when rehab really does what what what what? But make you misplace underwear and get her
really fucked up plus cut cut cut, make you misplace underwear and get her really fucked up
plus cut cut cut cut.

They tried to make me go to rehab I said no no no, Iâll take my black ass to rehab thereâs no
hydro dro dro.


I aint got the time,
And if my Daddy thinks im fine,
Heâs tried to make me go to rehab,
I wont go, go, go.

The man said, why you think you here?
I said, I got no idea
Im gonna, im gonna loose my baby
so I always keep a bottle near

He Said, I just think youâre depressed
Kiss me, yeah baby
And go rest

Iâm tryin to make me go to rehab
I said no, no, no
Yes I been black, but when I come back
You wont know, know, know

I donât ever wanna drink again
I just, ooo, I just need a friend
Im not gonna spend 10 weeks
Have everyone think im on the mend

Itâs not just my pride
Itâs just til these tears have dried

Theyâre tryin to make me go to rehab
I said no, no, no
Yes I been black, but when I come back,
You wont know, know, know

I aint got the time,
And if my daddy thinks im fine
Heâs trying to make me go to rehab
I wont go, go, go.
