Uh, as he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo, uh!
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet, uh!
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom
Annie are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?

Are you OK, Annie?
Annie are you OK?

So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?

Annie are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?

Are you OK, Annie?
Annie are you OK?

So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?

Annie are you OK?
Will you tell us that you're OK (uh!)

There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - A crescendo Annie

He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet (uh!)

Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down

It was your doom
Annie are you OK?

So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A Smooth Criminal
I don't know!

(Annie are you OK, Will you tell us, that you're OK)
I don't know!

(There's a sign in the window)
I don't know!

(That he struck you - A crescendo Annie)
I don't know!

(He came into your apartment)
(Left bloodstains on the carpet)

I don't know why baby!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)

I don't know!
(You were struck down)

(It was your doom - Annie!)
(Annie are you OK?)
Dang, gone it - Baby!
(Will you tell us, that you're OK)
Dang, gone it - Baby!
(There's a sign in the window)
Dang, gone it - baby!
(That he struck you - A crescendo Annie)
Hoo! Hoo!
(He came into your apartment)
Dang, gone it!
(Left bloodstains on the carpet, uh!)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
Dang gone it!
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom - Annie!)
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A Smooth Criminal
