Ah, in this life I've seen everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand-in-hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own gravesides
I've seen pigs all sitting, watching picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you


Do ya, do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya, do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind


Well, I heard the crowd singing out of tune
As they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne by the light of the moon
I heard the preachers banging on the drums
But I never heard nothing like you


In the country, where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a-running just to get a look, just to feel
To touch her long black hair, they don't give a damn


Ah, do ya, do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya, do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind


Well, I think you understand what I'm trying to say, woman
That is, I'd like to save you for a rainy day, yeah
I've seen enough of the world to know, baby
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow


Do ya, do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya, do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind


Ah you got it made

Do ya do ya want my life
Do ya do ya want my love
Do ya do ya want my face
Do ya do ya want my mind

Look out baby, there's a plane a-coming
