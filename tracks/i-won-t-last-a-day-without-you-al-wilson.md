Some sweet blessed night
If you should find yourself alone
Let me be the one you run to, girl
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to

Cause day after day
I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong
And I'm not that strong

It's nice to know that
There's someone I can turn to
Who will always care
And you're always there

When there's no
Getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams
Won't come true

I can take all the madness
That the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Oh, oh, baby
Let me be the one you run to
Girl, let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to

So many times when the city
Seems to be without a friendly face
Oh, it's a lonely place

But it's nice to know that
You'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile
It's all worthwhile

When there's no
Getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of
Dreams won't come true

Girl, I can take all the madness
That this he world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

You just have to touch me
And I end up singing
Troubles seem to up
And disappear

Just touch me with
The love you're bringing
I can't hardly lose
When you're near
When you're near

Let me be the one you run to, baby
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to
Understand you and hold
Your sweet tender hand, baby

Oh, just let me be
The one you run to
Let me be the one

If all my friends have
Forgotten half their promises
Now, they're not unkind
Oh, they're just hard to find

Oh, but one look at you and
I know that I could learn
To live without the rest
Oh, baby, I found the best

When there's no
Getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of
Dreams won't come true

Girl, I can take all the madness
That the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Oh, baby
Let me be the one you run to
Why don't you let me be
The one you turn to

Cause I just can't last a day
Without you, baby
I'm never gonna last a day
Without you

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be, let me be, baby...
