Highway run
into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind

Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And loving a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be

Oh, boy, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile

Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am lost without you

And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you

Oh, girl, you stand by me!
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm still yours
I'm still yours
Faithfully
