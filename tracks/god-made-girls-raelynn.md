Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand
So God made girls

Somebody's gotta make him get dressed up
Give him a reason to wash that truck
Somebody's gotta teach him how to dance
So God made girls

He needed something soft and loud
And sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful, unbreakable
That lights up in the dark

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls for singing in your front seat
God made girls for dancin' to their own beat
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
Then God made girls

Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive
Give him a reason to hold that door
So God made girls

Somebody's gotta put up a fight
Make him wait on a Saturday night
To walk downstairs and blow his mind
So God made girls

Something that can wake him up
And call his bluff
And drag his butt to church
Something that is hard to handle
Somethin' fragile
To hold him when he hurts

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls for singin' in your front seat
God made girls for dancin' to their own beat
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls

Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
And God made girls for singin' in your front seat
God made girls for dancin' to their own beat
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world."
Then God made girls

Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
And God made girls, yeah
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

So God made girls
