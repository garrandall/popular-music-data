Ba da do bop ba da...

If I had it all
Could I make it without you
If I did it all
Is it with it without you

If I had the world
On my watch chain
And the stars beneath my shoes
I ain't got nothing, uh uh
Without you

Ba da do bop ba da...

How much is the time worth, baby
Without you
It isn't worth a dime, my honey
Without you

If I spent my time
Coining yellow gold
And all that it can do
I'm broke down, baby
Uh huh, without you

Ba da do bop ba da...

Well, I lay it on the line
My honey, it's so true
Oh, you're part of my life
It's a half life without you

Home is not a home
There's no life light shining through
You're my life light
Oh, baby, here's to you

Ba da do bop ba da...
