I saw a Kook who was standing on his head
He flipped his lid like he should have been in bed
I said, what gives man
He looked at me and said
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Bo-bo

And then the cat started strutting on hot coals
He was wearing sneaks, but they were so full of holes
He sang right out from the bottom of his soles
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Bo-bo

Listen here, baby, the Yogi man said
It's all a matter of the mind
Just commune with your innermost being
Baby, you'll be just fine

He was hip, all right, wasn't he

Though I tried my best to dig my inner me
I walked on coals, my head below my knee
Until at last I heard him say perfectly
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi, I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Bo-bo
