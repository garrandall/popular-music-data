Ow!
Ewwww, yeah!

'Cause you got it made,
Eww, you're somethin'.
Talk about how you got it all,
When you ain't got nothin'.

God you're hot,
Like a pleasure stone,
My body touch you,
You will find it on your own,
Some people won't you run to.

Don't know? and dream,
'Cause you don't know what it means,
'Til somebody loves you.


Eww, stars don't shine,
Your life, is wasted time,
'Til somebody needs you,
'Til you need someone.
And no other?
'Til somebody loves you.


All the things in life,
All that money buys you,
But they can't hold you close at night,
And satisfy you.

When your hots? hot for love,
And you're gonna listen,
All the things that you really need,
Is the only thing you're missin'.

But let someone inside,
And you just ain't alive,
'Til somebody loves you.



Don't ya think it's time for a change,
Huh?
(Let somebody love you)
You'll never know true love,
'Til you start to let somebody love...
Let somebody love you.

Let somebody,
Let somebody,
Let somebody love you.

'Til somebody loves you,


Let somebody,
Let somebody,
Let somebody love you.
(Somebody needs you)

'Til you need someone,
And no one?
(Somebody loves you)
Somebody,
Somebody,
Ewww, ewww,

(Somebody needs you)
Somebody,
Somebody,

Let somebody,
Let somebody,
Let somebody love you...
