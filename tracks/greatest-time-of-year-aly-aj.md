There's a special kind of feeling in the air
It only happens at this time of year
When everyone is filled with love and cheer
'Cause that's what matters

Pretty paper boxes tied with bows
Walking in the sun or in the snow
We can feel the excitement growing, knowing


It's the greatest time of year, and it's here
Help me celebrate it
With everybody here, friends so dear
Let me simply state it
Joy to the world and everyone
Lift up your hearts and feel the love
It's our favourite way, to spend the holiday
Yeah

We can get all cozy by the fire
Turn the music up a little higher
I don't think that I could ever tire
Of being together

Decorate the tree, hang mistletoe
And stand by me

It's a picture perfect moment captured
Memories that we'll have after



Spend the holidays...

It's the greatest time

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here
Help me celebrate it
With everybody here, friends so dear
Let me simply state it
Joy to the world
Joy to the world
Joy to the world
It's the greatest time of year
It's the greatest time
