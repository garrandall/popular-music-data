Goodmorning heartache
You all gloomy sight
Goodmorning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night
I tossed and turned
Until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you
But you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now every day I start by
Saying to you
Goodmorning heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those monday blues
Straight through sunday blues

Goodmorning heartache
Here we go again
Goodmorning heartache
You're the one who knew me well
Might as well get used to you
Hangin' around
Goodmorning heartache
Sit down
