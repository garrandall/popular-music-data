Until you came, it felt like my world
Was fallin' apart at the seams
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain
Was turnin' my hopes into sand
Ah, I was a yesterday man until I found you

It was as plain as the nose on my face
That I was heading nowhere
Then into my life came an angel of grace
Sunlight in her hair
Now love is the strangest emotion
'Cause just when
I want you to stay
Seems like you're changing, don't turn me away
Don't turn me away

Until you came, it felt like my world
Was fallin' apart at the seams
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain
Was turnin' my hopes into sand
Ah, I was a yesterday man until I found you

I'm like a man in a mantle of black
Who just saw the light
Who cast off the shadow when you gave him back
The meaning to life
Now love is the strangest emotion
'Cause just when I want you to stay
Seems like you're changing, don't turn me away
I want you to stay

Until you came, it felt like my world
Was fallin' apart at the seams
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain
Was turnin' my hopes into sand
Ah, I was a yesterday man until I found you
