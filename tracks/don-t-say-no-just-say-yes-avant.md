Oh...Yes...
Oh babe...Yes babe..

I hope she answers my prayers tonite

 Open your heart and let me pour my loving
Inside of you (...inside of you)
You make me feel like living and breathing again
I wanna touch you (...i wanna touch you)
 Don't say...No...(just say)...yes...(oh babe)
Your body's what I need
Don't say ...No..(just say)...Yes..(oh babe)
I can hear you calling me
 Your my diamond that shines all of the time
On mercy me, yeah...yeah
You make me reach my peak
the day you told me that you wanted me...don't be afraid...please
 Don't say...No..(just say)...Yes...(oh babe)
Your body's what I need
Don't say...No...(just say)...Yes...(oh babe)
I can hear you calling me
 You are my season...(...season)
And you are the reason...
I feel the way I do...
As our bodies come as one...(...come as one)
Your my star..(my star)...That what you are(...you are...you are)


Now let me hear you say yes...say yes...say yes...
Oh yeah
Now let me hear you say yes...say yes...say yes...
oh yeah

Come here baby...lay down right here
I don't wanna talk no more...
I can feel you...your body all over mine..
Oh wee...open your door for me... I'm coming in...
..knock, knock...knock, knock babe
