You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
I know! that deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide the secret
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine!

Give me just one night, una noche!
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche!
I'll give you the time of your life!
(the time of you life, oh
(I'll give you the time of your life)
(ohaby yeah!)

Your eyes of passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
see what's hiding inside

Just give me one night, una noche!
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche!
I'll give you the time of your life
(the time of your life ohyeah)
(ohaby)

Aye que rico
me pone loca
como te mueves
como me toca
tu movimiento
tu sentimiento
si yo te quiero
te doy la noche
toda la noche
Aye, vamos!

Give me just one night!
(Give me one night baby)
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night
(Ah Just one night oh baby)
I'll give you the time of your life
(I'll give you the time of your life)
Give me just one night

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
(A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche (oh yeah)
I'll give you the time of your life

(Come on come on come on now baby)

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
(A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
(I'll give you the time of your life)
(the time of your life)

oh yeah
