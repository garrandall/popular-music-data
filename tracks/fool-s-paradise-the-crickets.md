Do you think of me darlinâ??
While weâ??re many miles apart
Oh please be true to me my darlinâ??
For you are the flower of my heart

Many nights Iâ??ve sat alone
And Iâ??ve worried over you
But Iâ??ll never worry dear
If your love is true

Please come back to me my darlinâ??
Cause I canâ??t live while weâ??re apart
Please come back to me my darlinâ??
For you are the flower of my heart

Many nights Iâ??ve sat alone
And Iâ??ve worried over you
But Iâ??ll never worry dear
If your love is true

Please come back to me my darlinâ??
For I canâ??t live while weâ??re apart
Come back - come back to me my darlinâ??
For you are the flower of my heart
