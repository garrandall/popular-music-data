Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side

And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near

And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's going to hurt me
For a long, long time

Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay

And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause
Living in the memory
Of a love that never was

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm going to miss you
For a long, long time

And I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time
