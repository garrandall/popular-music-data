Every night the sun goes down
All alone my room gets dark
I wish I could shut down
This feeling in my heart

I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all

I hate it when you come my way
But I hate when you leave me too
I'm hooked, I know that look
There's nothing I can do

I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all

I'm a hard boy to beat
I get back on my feet
But I better go home
And leave that girl alone

I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
