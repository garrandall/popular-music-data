Uh, that was a little embarrassing
Some of that documentary footage, but, uh
You know what? My family has given me everything
And that's why I am who I am
You know, one of my favorite memories of life
Was sittin' on my grandfather's floor, cross-legged
And learning songs from The Great American Songbook
I have and always will have a deep respect and reverence
For the music, the writers, the arrangers
I know very well that I stand on the shoulders of giants
And so right now, it gives me a great sense of pride
To pay homage to some of my many heroes
People like Frank Sinatra
Dean Martin
And the incomprable Louis Prima
I only hope I do 'em justice

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what Spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and I adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words, babe
You know I, you know I love
I love you

Well, you're nobody 'til somebody loves you
You're nobody 'til somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old
The world still is the same, you never change
Just as sure as the stars shine above
Well, you're nobody 'til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

Alright, let's go
Hey
Hey

I'm just a gigolo (Gigolo)
And everywhere I go (Gigolo)
People know the part I'm playin' (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
Pay for every dance (Gigolo)
Sellin' each romance (Gigolo)
Oh, what they say (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
Now there may come a day
When youth will pass away
They, what will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They'll say, "Just a gigolo"
Life goes on without me

'Cause I ain't got nobody
No, there's nobody
Cares for me
Nobody
Cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely
So sad and lonely
Won't some sweet boy
Come take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad
Let's go, let's go

I ain't got nobody
Nobody
I says, nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
I says, no one (No one)
There's only one (There's only one)
There's only one (There's only one)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
No one (No one)
Nobody cares for me

In other words, please be true
In other words
In other words
I love you

Hey
Oh, thank you very much
Oh, no, no
Thank you
Alright
