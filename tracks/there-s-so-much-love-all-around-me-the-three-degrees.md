A long time ago, it seems
That I was young and full of dreams, ooh yeah
The world was mine alone
I watched my world soon disappear
As I went on from year to year
And then the world I knew was gone


Don't you know I
I sat back and search my soul
And find a whole new world of love unfold
Inside of me
And do you believe that


There is so much love all around me
I tell you I'm so glad that you found me
Because the love I found is the love I never knew
And don't you know it's true?


And so I give my love to you and it's yours
Do what you wanna do, ooh yeah
But pretty as it go on
(Oooooh, come on and love like you wanna)
Come on and put your hand in mind (like you wanna)
And for the love, the love you'll find here in me, ooh baby
How happy we will be, oh yeah


(So much love all around me)
There is so much love all around me
I'll tell you that I'm so glad (glad that you found me)
So much love all around me (all around me)
I'll tell you that I'm so glad (I'm glad that you found me)
Hey, so much love all around me (all around me)
So much love all around me (that you found me)
