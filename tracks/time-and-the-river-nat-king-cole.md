Time and the river
Will bring my love to me.
If I must, I'll wait forever
By the river that took her to the sea.

Here by the river
We loved, we laughed, we cried.
But with time, my love, my darling,
Left my arms and was gone with the tide.

How long I've been lonely;
Star of love, shine bright.
I need her; oh, lead her
To my arms tonight.

Time and the river,
How swiftly they go by.
But my heart will beat for no other
Till time stands still and the river runs dry.

How long I've been lonely;
Star of love, shine bright.
I need her; oh, lead her
To my arms tonight.

Time and the river,
How swiftly they go by.
But my heart will beat for no other
Till time stands still and the river runs dry.
