I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriÃ¨re in the magazine
You want a piece of me
You want a piece of me

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day another drama
Guess I can't see the harm
In working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm
I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This Just In
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me)

I'm Mrs. You Want A Piece Of Me
Tryin' and pissin' me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Who's flippin' me off
Hopin' I'll resort to some havoc
End up settlin' in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me? (you want a piece of me)

I'm Mrs. Most Likely To Get On The TV For Slippin' On The Streets
When getting the groceries, no, for real
Are you kidding me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry
I mean please
Do you want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This Just In
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me)

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriÃ¨re in the magazine
You want a piece of me
You want a piece piece of me
You want a piece of me

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This Just In
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me)

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This Just In
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me)

Piece of me
You want a piece of me me
