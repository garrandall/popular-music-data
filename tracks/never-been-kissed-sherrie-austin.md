If I show up ten minutes early, baby
You can bet that you'll be running behind
But when it comes to loving me now, baby
I have to say you're right on time and

I've never been kissed, never been kissed
Never been kissed like this, no, no, no
I've never been touched, never been touched baby
'Til I felt your touch
Oh your love's going to my head so fast
Just like the bubbles in a champagne glass
Now I know what I've been missing
I've never been kissed, like this
Oh like this

Well you're a fool for wild-eyed-poetry, baby
I only like the kind that rhymes
And you're a little rough around the edges now, baby
But your kind of edges suit me just fine

I've never been kissed, never been kissed
Never been kissed like this, no, no, no
I've never been touched, never been touched baby
'Til I felt your touch
Oh your love's going to my head so fast
Just like the bubbles in a champagne glass
Now I know what I've been missing
I've never been kissed
Oh like this

This is more than temporary madness, baby
This is more than hearts just doing time
If love weren't so serious we could laugh about it, baby
Yeah, we could laugh until we cried

I've never been kissed, never been kissed
Never been kissed like this, no, no, no
I've never been touched, never been touched, baby
'Til I felt your touch
Oh your love's going to my head so fast
Just like the bubbles in a champagne glass
Now I know what I've been missing
I've never been kissed, like this
Oh like this

Oh like this
I've never been kissed
No I've never been kissed
