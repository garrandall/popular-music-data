You been talkin', talkin' to the people
Tryin' to get them to go your way
Tellin' us not to worry
That we won't be led astray

So blind, and signifying
Your opponents always lying
Think about the mistakes you make
'Cause I believe America's at stake

You know, busin', busin' is the issue
Do you have a plan with you
If, if you have a plan
If you have a master plan, got to vote for you
Hey, hey, got to vote for you
You're the man

We don't wanna hear no more lies
About how you planned to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise

The nation's taxation
Is causin' all, all this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind

Economics, is the issue
Do you have a plan with you?
'Cause if you've got a master plan
Got to vote for you
You're the man

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
