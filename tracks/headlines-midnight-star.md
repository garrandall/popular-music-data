Sherry was a waitress,
At the only joint in town.
She had a reputation,
As a girl who'd been around.
Down Main Street after midnight,
With a brand new pack of cigs.
A fresh one hanging from her lips,
A beer between her legs.
She'd ride down to the river,
And meet with all her friends.

The road goes on forever
And the party never ends


Sonny was a loner,
Bolder than the rest.
He was goin' in the Navy,
But he couldn't pass the test.
So he hung around town,
And he sold a little pot.
The law got wind of Sonny,
And one day he got caught.
But he was back in business,
When they set him free again.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


Sonny's playin' eight ball,
At the joint where Sherry works.
Some drunken out-of-towner,
Put his hand up Sherry's skirt.
Sonny took his pool cue,
Laid the drunk out on the floor.
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar,
Walked out of the door.
She's runnin' right behind him,
Reachin' for his hand.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


They jumped into his pick-up,
Sonny jammed her down in gear.
Sonny looked at Sherry,
Said, "Let's get on out of here."
The stars were high above them.
The moon was in the east.
The sun was setting on them,
When they reached Miami Beach.
They got a motel by the water,
And a quart of Bombay Gin.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


They soon ran out of money.
But Sonny knew a man.
Who knew some Cuban refugees,
Who dealt in contraband.
Sonny met the Cuban,
In a house just off the route.
With a briefcase full of money,
And a pistol in his boot.
The cards were on the table,
When the law came bustin' in.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


The Cubans grabbed the goodies,
Sonny grabbed the jack.
He broke the bathroom window,
And climbed on out the back.
Sherry drove the pick-up,
Through the alley on the side.
Where the lawman tackled Sonny,
And was reading him his rights.
She stepped out in the alley,
With a single-shot four-ten.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


They left the lawman dyin',
And they made their get away.
Got back to the motel,
Just before the break of day.
Sonny gave her all the money,
And he blew a little kiss.
If they ask you how this happened,
Say I forced you into this.
She watched him as his tail lights,
Disappeared around the bend.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.


There's a main street after midnight.
Just like it was before.
Twenty-one months later,
At the local grocery store,
Sherry buys a paper,
And a cold six-pack of beer.
The headlines read that Sonny,
Is going to the chair.
She pulls back onto main street,
In her new Mercedes-Benz.

The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.
