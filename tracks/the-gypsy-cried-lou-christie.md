I had some trouble with my baby
So I had my fortune read
I had some trouble with my baby
And this is what the gypsy said

The gypsy cried, she cried

Gypsy, oh tell me, what is in your crystal ball
Gypsy, oh tell me, will my tears fall

She cried, she cried and said

Watch your step, ooh she'll hurt you yet
Oh no no no no no no no
Watch your step, ooh she'll hurt you yet
Oh no no no no no no no

Gypsy, oh tell me, does she want to marry me
Gypsy, oh tell me, when the wedding's gonna be

She cried, she cried

Listen to what the gypsy said
Oh no no no no no no no
Listen to what the gypsy said
Oh no no no no no no no

Gypsy, say it isn't true
Watch out, ooh she doesn't love you
Watch out, ooh she doesn't love you
Gypsy, say it isn't true
