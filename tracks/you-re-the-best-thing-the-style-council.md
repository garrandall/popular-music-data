I could be discontent and chase the rainbow's end
I might win much more but lose all that is mine
I could be a lot but I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring
I might shoot to win and commit the sin
Of wanting more than I've already got
I could runaway but I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day
(The one that makes me say, hey)

Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away

I might be a king and steal my peoples' things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule but I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way
(Say listen what I say)

Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away

Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away

I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style
For I realise your love means more than anything
(The song you make me sing, yeah)

Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away
Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away
