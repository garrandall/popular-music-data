There's A Kind Of Hush All Over The World Tonight
All over the world You can hear the sounds of lovers in love
You know what I mean
Just the two of us and nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good just holding you tight

So listen very carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear is
When I whisper in you ear, I love you, forever and ever
There's A Kind Of Hush All Over The World Tonight
All over the world You can hear the sounds of lovers in love

There's A Kind Of Hush All Over The World Tonight
All over the world You can hear the sounds of lovers in love
You know what I mean
Just the two of us and nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good just holding you tight

So listen very carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear is
When I whisper in you ear, I love you, forever and ever
There's A Kind Of Hush All Over The World Tonight
All over the world You can hear the sounds of lovers in love
