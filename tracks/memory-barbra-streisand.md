Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone

In the lamplight 
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then

I remember the time 
I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in

When the dawn comes 
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun

If you'll touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun...
