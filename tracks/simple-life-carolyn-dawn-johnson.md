I wake up with the sun on my face
On the edge of the bed, babe you're taking up all the space
I roll you over then I give you a kiss
Meet you in the middle
That's where all the fun is


Life as we know it
It's going good 
That's an understatement
It's going better than I ever thought it could
Never been so happy, so content
Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Life as we know it... now

You're doing dishes if I'm cooking the meal
We got an understanding, and it's a pretty good deal
We read our books at each end of the couch
No conversation needed
To stay in touch in this house


Life as we know it
It's going good 
That's an understatement
It's going better than I ever thought it could
Never been so happy, so content
Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Life as we know it... now

I whisper... I love you
You tell me... you love me too
It's so easy, so simple
I wonder why we didn't think of this before


Life as we know it
It's going good 
That's an understatement
It's going better than I ever thought it could
Never been so happy, so content
Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Life as we know it... now

Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Right... now
