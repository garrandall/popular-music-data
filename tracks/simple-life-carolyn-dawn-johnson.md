Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da
I have wondered this world
Far and wide
I've been all around to the other side
But theres nothing like coming home
Nothing like coming home

I wanna sit on my front porch
And drink my lemonade
Cut my grass after church every sunday
And Go out saturday night
And live the simple life
Wake up in the mornig to these fields of gold
Take a long walk down a gravel road

Chorus
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that i'll always have someone to hold
Oh I wanna live the simple life, yeah

I wanna take a blanket down to the creek
And let the water sing me to sleep
And let go in time
Live the simple life..
Well lately I've seen too many city lights
I wanna go somewhere where I can see the stars at night


Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that i'll always have someone to hold
Oh I wanna live the simple life, yeah yeah


Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing, and watch my babies grow
Know that I'll always have some, someone to hold
Oh, Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh I wanna live the simple life
Oh I wanna live the simple life
Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da Da..
Mm That's Right
