Quit beatin' your chest and actin' like you're gonna bite a big hole out of me
Quit messin' and testin' 'cause this ain't at all impressin' to me
Paper tiger, paper tiger, you paper tigers are all alike
Your roar is much worse than your bite
Quit spyin' and sighin' and lyin' and tryin' to be so mean
'cause you ain't scarin' nobody, baby, you're just makin' a scene
Paper tiger, paper tiger, you're just a'flutterin' in the tree
Ain't shakin' no one but the leaves
Oh how you try to be so brave
Thinkin' that I'll run back to ya and be afraid
And so you try to come on strong
Thinkin' that I will go along, but you're wrong
Paper tiger, paper tiger, you paper tigers are all alike
Your roar is much worse than your bite
Your roar is much worse than your bite

C'mere, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty ah ha ha ha ha
