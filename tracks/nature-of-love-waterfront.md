Early morning when I leave your side
Start my car and drive
Before the new day's dawning
You know I'll return
Apart we won't survive

If love doesn't mean enough (really mean enough)
Somebody invents another word


Oh, oh, oh, in the nature of love
I never can say goodbye

Time and time again
Seems like we're hitting our heads against the wall
Fighting, cursing, how can we stand by?
And let it all slip away

If love doesn't mean enough (really mean enough)
Somebody invents another word


If love doesn't mean enough (really mean enough)
Somebody invents another word


Goodbye, goodbye
Nature of love, never can say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, I never can say goodbye
(Nature of love)
Never can say goodbye

Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
