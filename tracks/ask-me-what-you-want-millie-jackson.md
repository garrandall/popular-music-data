Come to me before your friends
Tell you they can't help you
I'm your woman, I should be
The first one to know
If you want something
If you need something

Why do you think
I work so hard and
Do all the things I do
Because I don't want nobody
Else to do a thing for you

(CHORUS)
Baby, baby, please
Ask me what you want
And I'll try my best
To get it, get it
Get it, get it
Ask me what you want
And I'll try my best
To get it, get it
Get it, get it

You've shown me
That a woman's place
Is right beside her man
This I can understand

That foolish pride keeps
Pushing aside all the things
I wanna do for you
I'm on your side

Don't you know
That when you're down
I'm the one you
Should turn to

Don't be ashamed
Because it's the same
Thing I expect of you

(CHORUS)

Why should my giving you things
Make you feel insecure
I'm also giving you all
The love anyone can endure

Ask me what you want
And I'll try my best
To get it, get it
Get it, get it...
