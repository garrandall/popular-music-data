(Carter/Lewis)

Every time I see you lookin' my way
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
In the car or walking down the highway
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you move up closer to me
I get a feelin' that's oo-wee
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love

When I feel you put your arms around me
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you asked me to meet your Ma
I knew that baby, we'd be going far
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love

------ rhythm guitar ------

All my friends are cryin' out to meet you
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Wedding bells are gonna chime
Baby, baby, you're gonna be mine
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
