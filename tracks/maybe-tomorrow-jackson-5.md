I don't know how many stars there are
Up in the heavenly sky
I only know my heaven it's here on earth
Each time you look into my eyes
The way you do, baby
Thank you, thank you, baby

My beautiful bird, you have flown away
I held you too tight, I can see
You're all I need to get by
No one else could make me cry
The way you do, baby

Come on

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you
You are the four seasons of my life

But maybe tomorrow
You'll change your mind, girl
Maybe tomorrow
You'll come back to my arms, girl

Maybe she will

You're all I need to get by
No one else could make me cry
The way you do, baby

Come on

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you
You are the four seasons of my life

But maybe tomorrow
You'll change your mind, girl
Maybe tomorrow
You'll come back to my arms, girl

You are the book that I read each day
Sing it, sing it
You are the song that I sing
Sing it, sing it, sing it
You are the four seasons of my life

But maybe tomorrow
You'll change your mind, girl
Maybe tomorrow
You'll come back to my arms, girl

You are the book that I read each day, yeah
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you
You are the four seasons of my life

But maybe tomorrow
You'll change your mind, girl
Maybe tomorrow
You'll come back to my arms, girl

Oh, baby, I need you
Listen to me, girl
You are the song that I sing
You are the four seasons of my life

But maybe tomorrow
You'll change your mind, girl
Maybe tomorrow
You'll come back to my arms, girl

You are the song that I sing
