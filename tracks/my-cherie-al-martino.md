It seems like only yesterday
I'd meet her in that small cafe
And dance with my Cherie

We'd kiss by flickering candlelight
I'd whisper as I held her tight
I love you, sweet Cherie

But now she's just a memory
A million miles away from me
Alone in old Paree

But if I live forever
I'll always be in love
In love with my Cherie

It seems like only yesterday
I'd meet her in that small cafe
And dance with my Cherie

We'd kiss by flickering candlelight
I'd whisper as I held her tight
I love you, sweet Cherie

But now she's just a memory
A million miles away from me
Alone in old Paree

But if I live forever
I'll always be in love
In love with my Cherie
