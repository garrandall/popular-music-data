Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


Every time you're near, baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do
And oh baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool


My friends tell me
Something has come over me
And I think I know what it is
I think I'm in love


Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (In love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Boy, I think I'm in love)
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you


Just the other night, baby
I saw you hanging
You were with your crew, I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turned and looked me in my eyes
Boy, you really blew my mind


I don't know what's gotten into me
But I kinda think I know what it is
I think I'm in love


Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (In love)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (I'm in love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (I'm in love)
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you


Something strange has come over me
Got me going out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside
I think I'm in love


Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Oh yeah)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (I think I'm in love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (In love with you)
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
(Feel for you, ah-ah)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Ah-ah, in love with you)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you
(Goin' out of my mind, boy)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (I think I'm in love)
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
Baby, every time you call my name
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
(You drivin' me insane)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you
(I don't know what to do)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
(Never met a guy like you)
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
