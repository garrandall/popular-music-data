Yeahhh hmm hmm hmm

I am so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me

'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my life with you

The same thing's, baby
Since we've been together

Loving you forever
Is what I need

Let me be the one you come running to
Baby, baby
I'll never be untrue, baby

Ooh, baby
Let's, oughta stay together

Loving you, whether, whether times are
Good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

Whether times are good are bad
Happy or sad
Come on

Why, somebody, why people break up?
Oh
Turn around and make up

I just can't see
'Cause you'd never do that to me, baby
Would you baby

Being around you is all I see
Ooh baby, let's, we oughta stay together

Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on

Let's babe, oughta stay together, baby
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on

Good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on
Good or bad
Happy or sad

Oh, oh
