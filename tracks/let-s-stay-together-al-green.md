Let's stay together


I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you


Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue


Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad


Why somebody, why people break up
Turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do


Let's, we ought to stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad


C'mon, let's, let's stay together
I'll keep on lovin' you whether
Whether times are, oh times are good or times are bad
