What does every man look at first?


Some fellas look at the eyes
Some fellas look at the nose
Some fellas look at the size
Some fellas look at the clothes


I don't care if the eyes are red
I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if she's underfed
I don't care if her clothes are worn
'Cause first I look at the purse


Some fellas look the smiles they wear
Some fellas look the legs that's all
Some fellas look the style of their hair
Some fellas want their waist to be small


I don't care if the teeth are big
I don't care if the legs are big
I don't care if their hair's a wig
Why waste time lookin' at the waistline?
'Cause first I look at the purse


A woman can be fine as can be
With kisses sweet as honey
But that don't mean a thing to me
If she ain't got no money
'Cause if the purse is fat, that's where it's at


Some fellas look at the way they walk
The way they swing and sway
Some fellas like the way they talk
And dig the things they say


But I don't care if she wobbles like a duck
Or talk with a lisp, I still think I'm a good lover
If the dollar bills are crisp
'Cause first I look at the purse


First I look at the purse
First I look at the purse
First I look at the purse
Kisses can be as sweet as honey
But I want me some money
She can be covered with a rash
As long as she gots some cash
I want a big fine car...
