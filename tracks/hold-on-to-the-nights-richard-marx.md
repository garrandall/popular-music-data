Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever-changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase
The beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you
Something more
That I could be yours

How can we explain
Something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now
Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you something more

Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
Hold on to the nights
