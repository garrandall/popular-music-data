"Think About It"]
Tic-tac, toe'n, three in a row and privilege
Sit back, relax, listen to a pro and
As I start goin, blowin, flowin, and showin
MCs' - that I am the capital H-E-A-V-Y-D-sin
This is my yard, better get my? preason?
No discontent cause I'm all about pleasin
Ladies come to me because, they love squeezin
If you don't see me, I'm probably skeezin!
Eaaaaaaa-zy desert on the smooth tip
As I get loose, kinda like I say rip this
Format of my rap, listen to direction
Six foot three, wit a manila, complexion
Dance - shake, rock, roll
Heav is in the house I got total, control
I'ma inject, respect, collect a fat check
Heav is in effect - but you ain't heard nuttin yet!
How could I explain to ya - the Heavmania
Tryna figure eight or make it simple and plain to ya
Hmm, I'm the Heavster, a rap register
That flows with cash so fast
