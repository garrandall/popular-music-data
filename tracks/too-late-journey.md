See the stop-light turning red
Don't you listen to what it's said
All the things you try to hide
They keep you running hard inside.Oh, you got to leave this town before it's
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late to make the change
Oh, yes, my friend, you're fading fast, if you stay here you won't last
Before your time has run astray, you've got to try to get away
Oh, you got to leave this place before it's
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late to make the change
Too late, too late to make the change
Too late to make the change
Yes, it's time to make the change, yes, it's time to rearrange
So, my friend, I join the fight for the things you know are right
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late to make the change
Too late, too late to make the change
Too late to make the change
Too late, before it's too late
