Deeper and deeper and deeper down into the ground
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Woah ohhh oh oh ohhh oh ohhh

I'm not one to play around but I'll make an exception
Loosen up you attitude and lend me your attention
Boy I'll be your rhythm ace I'll do it nice and slow
By the time we get to my house baby I'll be good to go

Fade to black heart attack now we're goin all around got a rockin' in your heartbeat gonna spread your love around
I love the bass I love the good vibrations the way you love me gives me cool sensations
So turn it up
Don't bring me down
I love the bass

Never underestimate the power of attraction
Put aside your silly pride and feel my love reaction
Come a little closer baby can you feel the heat
Jammin' is my specialty
Can you feel the beat
Feel the beat

I love the bass I love the good vibrations
