Ohh but love was just too hard to find
Until you came along into my life
Then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said you wanted to be mine
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me where you want me now baby
For your love I would do anything every night I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love

Driving home from a sleepy old town
After my work is all through
And on my way home well I wish I could fly
Just to get back faster to you

Talking all day on the telephone
And staring at the clock on the wall
Well I'm just alone with you out on my own
And I just can't wait to hold you because

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love

You're giving me chills up my spine
I'm feeling so fine baby all of the time
I really don't care if it never stops
Because I love you up until I drop

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
