I've got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I've got a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breath You asked what's wrong with me
You know my friends say "You're just being crazy"
The next time we hang out I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'till then
Whoah, Whoah I, I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

I've got my sight set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
When all my friends said
"You're just being crazy"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest till then
Whoa, whoa, I, and I can't wait to see you again
