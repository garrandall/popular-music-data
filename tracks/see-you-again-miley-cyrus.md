I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again


I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again


The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again


I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the sign
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again


The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again


I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim


The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again


(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again
