Gonna sing this song y'all
Singin' it for my baby
She's the only one can bring me joy
That's why I sing these happy songs

They go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Come on now happy song, happy song now

On a cold, rainy, windy night
She shut all the doors, she cut off the lights
She holds me and squeeze me tight
She tells me, "Big O, everything's all right"

And I go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Play it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Do it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Come on now those happy songs, happy, happy songs

Come on
Bring my breakfast to the table
When I go to work she knows I'm able
Do my job, I come back in
You oughta see my baby's face, she just grins, grins, grins

I go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Play it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Sing them happy songs
Lovely, lovely songs
Sweet soul songs
Those good old happy songs
Give you such a feeling
A lovely, lovely, feeling
It makes you wanna shout
It knocks you, knocks you out
Happy, happy songs
Those good old lovely songs
Those good old nursery rhyme songs
Those good old lovely songs
Those sweet soul music songs
