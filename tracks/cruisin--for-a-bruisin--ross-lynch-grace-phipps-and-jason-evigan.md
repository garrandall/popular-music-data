You better run, run, run
Here we come
Revving our engines under the sun
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'

Keeping it cool!
Smooth and steady!
Slick back hair
Man, things are getting heavy!
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'

Two wheels and an open road
Wrapped in leather, ready to go!

Don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want

We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way!


Bubblegum cherry pop
Go to the hop
Hanging with my brother
'Cause his friends are so hot
While they're cruisin' for some bruisin'!


Alright,
I went to the drive and what did I see?
A hundred little Bettie's all staring at me!
I was cruising for some loving!

I got these two wheels and an open road
Just pop that clutch, I'm ready to go
C'mon!

Don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want

We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way

It goes a 1, a 2, a 1, 2, 3!
A who, who, who's riding with me?
I got a gang full of bruisers, all cruisin' with me!
And we're tearing up, we're tearing up, we're tearing up the streets

Don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want

We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way

So don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want

We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way
No, we're not gonna live any other way!
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way!
