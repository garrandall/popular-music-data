There's something special about six o'clock
In the morning when it's still too early to knock
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock
Six o'clock, six o'clock

A few hours ago she was standing here
Just watching the stars in our eyes
And the lights as uptights disappear
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front
Six o'clock, six o'clock

I went home and found that trying to sleep was a laugh
Just watching my eyelids knowing my brain bids the night not to pass
I got up and got to scuffling around
But somehow it just wasn't the same happy town
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound
Six o'clock, six o'clock

If I go back where we parted
Could I ever be like that again?
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow
But what can I do 'til then?

Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn
Guess I had to learn going back where we were wouldn't help at all
And I wish my head had been working right
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night
But now I'm back alone feelin'twisted up tight
Six o'clock, six o'clock

Now I'm back alone...
Yes, now I'm back alone...
I'm back alone
