Alright you Chipmunks, Ready to sing your song?
 I'd say we are
 Yeah, Lets sing it now!
 Okay, Simon?
 OK
 Okay, Theodore?
 OK
 Okay Alvin?...Alvin?...ALVIN!!!
 OKAY!!


Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast

Want a plane that loops the loop
 Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late

 Ok Fellas, Get ready
That was very good, Simon
 Naturally!
 Very Good Theodore
 He He He He
 Uh Alvin, You were a little flat
Watch it, Alvin...Alvin?...ALVIN!!!
 OKAY!!


Want a plane that loops the loop
 I still want a Hula-Hoop

We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late
