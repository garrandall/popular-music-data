(Born to be loved
You were born to be loved
You were born to be loved
By only me)

Born to be loved
You were born to be loved
You were born to be loved
By only me

My heart and I agree
That you belong to me
So, darling, take my hand
Show me you understand

That you (born to be loved)
You were born to be loved
(Born to be loved)
You were born to be loved
(Born to be loved) by only me

Born to be loved
You were born to be loved
You were born to be loved
By only me

And as time goes by
I swear I'll always try
To give you happiness
With love and tenderness

For you (born to be loved)
You were born to be loved
(Born to be loved)
You were born to be loved
(Born to be loved) by only me

Born to be loved
You were born to be loved
You were born to be loved
By only me

Born to be loved
You were born to be loved
You were...
