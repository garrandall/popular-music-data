Look at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going


I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know


Look at these eyes
They never seen what matters
Look at these
Dreams so beaten and so battered


I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know


So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me, sometimes I see so clearly
That only truth I'll never know is me and you


Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation


I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know




I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know


I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all there is to know
