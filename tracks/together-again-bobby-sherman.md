Together again, me and myself
Wings on my shoes, losin' the blues, being myself
Maybe you're gone but I'm livin' on
So baby amen, I'm together again
I got the sun winkin' on me
Playin' that warm like I was born feelin' on me
Feelin' so good I'm knockin' on wood
Hey baby amen, I'm together again

You'll never witness this man break down and cry
Maybe I'll drop a tear but something's got in my eye
Together again, ah me and myself
Wings on my shoes, losin' the blues, just bein' myself
Maybe you're gone but I'm livin' on
I say it again, baby, baby amen
I'm together again

Bye baby, bye baby, bye baby, bye bye
Maybe you're gone but I'm livin' on
I'll say it again, baby, baby amen
I'm together again
Bye baby, bye baby, bye baby...
