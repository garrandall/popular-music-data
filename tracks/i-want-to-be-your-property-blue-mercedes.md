I want to be your property
I want to live like Cyd Charisse

What do you do when your
Lover cuts your heart in two
What can you say
Anyone can tell

What can I do, well, I better
Start to think about changing
I'm going now and never coming back

(It's got to be this way)
Sometimes I get so serious
(I've got to hear you say)


I want to be your property
No third degree will deter me
I want to live like Cyd Charisse
In a great big house by the sea

How does it feel when another's
Heart had made you steal
What can you say
Anyone can tell

What can I do, well, I better
Start to think about changing
I'm going now and never coming back

(It's got to be this way)
Sometimes I get so serious
(I've got to hear you say)


Well, I told you once
And I told you twice
And I told you everything
Would be all right

Well, I told you once
And I told you twice
And I told you everything
Would be all right
