This is a warning sign
For those reckless enough not to recognize
Another tear, it falls
If you surrender your desires against the wrecking ball
Pray I'm drunk enough, darling, not to feel no more
I came in alone and I'll die alone
You know I will, baby, yeah

Am I just running scared?
With Roy Orbison still ringing in my ears
Why don't you stay the night?
Hear some people wait a lifetime just to hear those lines

She dresses like a secret with her lips shut tight
Swears "I hope that there's good reason you're alone"
She says:
"Boy, don't you know that I've waited to love you"

It's easy if you let me just believe tonight
Don't tease me, let me just believe tonight

Well, I could tell you why
But to tell you the truth I ain't the telling kind
I thought I knew myself
How many times I look now I see someone else

The guilt is just a sickness that won't heal itself
If I could right each wrong in this life of song
You know I would, baby, yeah

It's easy, let me just believe tonight
Don't tease me, let me just believe tonight
It's easy, let me just believe tonight
Don't tease me, let me just believe tonight
It's easy, let me just believe tonight
Don't tease me, let me just believe tonight

Together we can make it if we leave tonight
You pack a lot of punch but have you lost the fight?
Promises won't ever keep you warm at night
There's too much at stake, I've got too much to hide

It's easy, let me just believe tonight
It's easy, let me just believe tonight
It's easy, let me just believe tonight
It's easy, let me just believe tonight
