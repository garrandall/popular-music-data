I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
Thought that I'd just drop by and let you know
That I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll cause you no more sorrow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
It won't replace all the heartaches I've caused you
It won't take the place of loving you, I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
Tell the kids I came by awhile last night
And I kissed them while they slept so tight
Make my cup of coffee sweet and make it warm
Just the way you used to be here in my arms
I'll have another half a cup and then I'll go
