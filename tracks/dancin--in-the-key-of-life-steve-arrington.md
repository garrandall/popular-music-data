I wake up in the morning
Thinking of you
Get out of bed and
Put on my dancing shoes

Hey, hey
I don't have a worry
Not a care in the world
I'm dancing in time
With my favorite girl
Don't you know that


Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life

Working Monday to Friday
Waiting for my payday
Go to church on Sunday
Where I kneel to pray
You know it

I thank God for making
My dreams come true
When the demon
Tries to make a play
You know you always
Pulled me through, oh, oh


My dancing feet are nothing
Without the spirit within
I know I'm gonna be there
When the saints go marching in

I'm just out here grooving
To the universe's heartbeat
Just want to spread some joy
To all the people I meet

The good news of the father
You just can't ignore, uh uh
When the fight starts to hit you
You want more and more and more

Now my dancing feet are nothing
Without the spirit within, yeah
I know I'm gonna be there
When the saints go marching in
Oh, oh

Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
From generation to generation
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life

Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life...
