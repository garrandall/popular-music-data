What's the matter with the way we look?
Surely it's not the end
I only meant to make my motions clear
You worry too much if it's understood
Should we be seen as friends?
Seems like a real good beginning right here

'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose

Better forget getting rid of me
I don't see how you can
You put me off and I will hunt you
Down...again
I'm mighty patient when I have to be
You have given me that
Still I look forward to the day you let me in
'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose
I'm gonna prove myself worthy
No more just hanging on
Without a prayer of a chance
I'm gonna come without warning
When your defenses are down and you're in
A desperate need
Oh, I bet you you then, you'll welcome me...
Your ol' companion
Your ol' companion
Remember baby
'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the the lock on it
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get, you won't get
No you won't get loose
Oh no
