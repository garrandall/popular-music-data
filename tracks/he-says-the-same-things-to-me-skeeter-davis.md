Shall I tell you what he said to you when he kissed you last night
I could tell it sigh for sigh and here's the reason why
He says the same things to me he says the same things to me
Ain't shall I tell you what he said to you as he held you so tight
Let me tell you from the start I know it now by heart
He says the same things to me he says the same things to me
But I know how it must hurt you to find his love isn't real
And if your heart is breaking think how I must feel
And did he tell you there's no other girl that his only love is you
If he did there's no surprise that's just the way he lies
He says the same things to me he says the same things to me
