Do you like what you see.






Don't rush, baby don't rush.(hey hey hey, Oo-eeey)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.(hey hey hey, Oo-oo-ooeey)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.(hey hey hey, Oh-yea-eh oooe)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.(Do you like what you see)



I know its after midnight, baby.
You said you've gotta be to work at eight,
I'm feelin kinda kinky right now baby,
I'm tellin you, you might have to be late.

Dont rush, baby don't rush.(Oh no...)
(I wanna take my time and do it right)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.(Oohooh yeah baby)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.(Dont rush me yeah)
(I wanna take my time and do it right)
Don't rush, baby don't rush.

When I'm in my grove I wanna make you move, baby.
I wanna take my time, and give you good lovin again, Girlfriend.
Cuz nobody else, baby.
Gurl you are so fine.
Your love's, constantly on my mind, baby.



You'll never know. (You'll never know baby)
How far, we'll go. (Just how far we'll go)
I'm keepin it strong. (Keepin it stong)
All night long. (All night long)
All night long. (All night long)
All night long. (Oh oh oh!]
Do you like,(Don't rush)
Do you like,(Baby don't rush)
Do you like what you see.


Do you like,
Do you like,
Do you like what you see.
