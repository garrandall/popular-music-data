In this farewell, there's no blood
There's no alibi
Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come
Wash away
What I've done
I face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
(Turn away)
(Nobody can save me)
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun, (sun)
Will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
Then the sun will set for you

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting in me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(I'm caught up in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(I'm caught up in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
(I'm caught up in the undertow)

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
