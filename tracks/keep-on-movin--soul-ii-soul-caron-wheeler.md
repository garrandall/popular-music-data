Keep on moving
Don't stop like the hands of time
Click clock, find your own way to stay
The time will come one day
Why do people choose to live their lives this way?


Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving don't stop, no
Keep on moving


It's our time, time today
The right time is here to stay
Stay in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will surely come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays


(Keep on moving)
Keep on moving
(Don't stop)
Keep on moving, don't stop no
(Like the hands of time)
Keep on moving
(Click clock)
(Find your own way to stay)
Keep on moving
The time will come one day

Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving


I know the time, time today
Walking alone in my own way
Extremely cold and rainy day
Friends and I have fun along the way
Yes we do
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will really come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays


(Keep on moving)
Keep on moving
(Don't stop)
Keep on moving, don't stop no
(Like the hands of time)
Keep on moving
(Click clock)

Keep on moving
(Find your own way to stay)
The time will come one day
(Yes)
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
