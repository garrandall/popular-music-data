Always had the best of everything
Anything money could buy
I go first class and I'll live like a king till I die

I surround myself with treasure
And devote each day to pleasure
Until late at night this king begins to cry

And I have cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my trembling hand

And I cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

In the comfort of my castle
I have lived my life in style
Let the troubled world just come and pass me by

I surround myself with treasure
And I fill each day with pleasure
Until late at night this king begins to cry

And I have cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my trembling hand

And I cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

In the hollow of an empire
I've become a warrior king
Hunting golden deals and million dollar schemes

When our fate has been decided
And my soul's been sub-divided
I will cry alone for half forgotten dreams

And I have cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my trembling hand

And I cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

Cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my trembling hand

And I cried like a baby
In the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand
