Niggas be insecure
Claiming that you ain't doing enough
Claiming that they need more
What you on your last breathe
Your last sweat
Your last dime
Out of your fucking mind
Can't you see I'm fucking trying
You want pussy 6 times a week
And you never wanna clean up
And you talk to me like shit
And you handle me too rough
And at the end of the day you got the nerve to bring up that bitch
That's the difference

And when I feel like this I can't take no shit
Stretch you out, out, out, out, out
We gon stretch you out, out, out, out, out
You just wanna have fun, fun, fun (Ohh)
We gon make you cum, cum, cum, cum, cum

Girl I heard that you been hurtin'
Just let me know if it ain't worth it
I could put mad Buggattees on you on purpose
And we could go half on a baby on purpose
And I'm going back just close the curtains purposely
Everything you do me you do it perfectly
And I be in your body like surgery
Like an insomniac gotta pop a purpy to sleep, yeah
Throw that ass round in a circle please
Throw that ass round in a circle for me yeah
Like your workin' for me
Don't you show no other nigga what you learning from me yeah

Stretch you out, out, out, out, out
We gon' stretch you out, out, out, out, out
You just wanna have fun, fun, fun (Ohh)
We gon make you cum, cum, cum, cum, cum

We gonna smile
