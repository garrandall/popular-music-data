Hey, who is that 
Better calm down around here
Hey girl, whatever you want... I got
Hey yeah
(Everything)
Everything you want from me (I want)
I'm gonna give it all to you


Baby if you please, tell me your desires
Of your heart (your heart)
One thing I can see
You're in need of lovin'
I can give it to you (hey, hey)
Don't lower your expectations
So you can say that you're just-
Someone in love
Baby, 'cause in my estimation
You should get all that you want
And it's my pleasure just to give it to you


Everything you that you want from me (from me now baby)
I'm gonna give it all to you (hey, hey)
Everything you that you want me to be (me to be)
I'm gonna be there just for you


Girl, it's a possibility
That you've been lonely for too long (too long)
Well I've got remedy for your frustration
In the words of this song
This song baby
Come closer my love, I'm already near
To keep you satisfied
It's me that you need
You can get it all from me
You don't have to worry
'cause I'm gonna give it to you


Everything that you want from me (I'm gonna give it baby)
I'm gonna give it all to you (to you)
Everything you want me to be (oh yeah)
I'm gonna be there just for you (for you)
Everything that you want from me (just want to know about my love)
I'm gonna give it all to you (baby can't you see whatever you want me to be)
Everything you want me to be (want me baby)
I'm gonna be there just for you
Hah ah
Whoa whoa
Everything
Everything
The love you deserve (yeah)
All you want in life (want in life, baby)
You are the one, only in my eyes
And that's enough for me to say - baby
