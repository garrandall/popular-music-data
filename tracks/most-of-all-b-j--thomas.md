Hello darlin', my â€“ it's good to hear you
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
How are all the folks, I'd love to see 'em
But girl I'd love to see you most of all

Well I've been staring at the rain and I've been thinkin'
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all

Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way

Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
Hopin' you still love me most of all

Girl , you know I love you most of all
I miss ya baby... Most of all
I miss ya baby, most of all
