Your love's so exciting 
Boy I can't deny it 
Since you found a place in my heart 
Givin' me a feeling 
Ooh it's such a feeling 
I pray that we never will part 
How can I explain it 
Please hear what I'm sayin' 
You bring so much so much joy to my life 
Words cannot express 
So much happiness 
I'll forever be by your side 

And I will give you my heart 
And I will always be true to you 
And I will love you forever 

If I could just make love to you 
Make love to you 
Girl I must confess it 
You've been such a blessing 
Never felt so good in my life 
You know how to take it 
I know how to give it 
We both always have a good time 
I hear what you're sayin' 
Lord knows you ain't playin' 
Ain't no doubt that I'm satisfied 
And I'll keep it comin' 
Keep bringin' the lovin' 
So baby bring your lovin' 
Every morning, noon, and night 



Oh give me just a minute and 
I'll jump right on in it 
We can make love under the stars 
All year pleasure pleasure 
I'll be yours forever 
Girl, I'll never leave now 
I'll be there to please you 
We won't have to worry at all 



I will go all the way down 
I'll make it feel so good 
I wanna do you right 
If I could just make love to you
