Now Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two
Seemed to know just what to do
Invented the sound that hooked you and me
Added one to make the Tennessee Three
The Man In Black was long and lean
Hit the Billboard charts with a Teenage Queen
Had a television show, the best we'd seen
That chick-a-boom rock really made a splash
Missing ol' Johnny Cash

Well, Johnny Cash was a friend of mine
Knew him well for a mighty long time
Shared the stage for many a show
Broke my heart to see him go
Cash had the fire of a thousand men
Loving life was his greatest sin
Treated his fans like the next of kin
Rapping a bit, talking trash
Missing ol' Johnny Cash


Well, now Johnny Cash wore black attire
And he fell into that Ring of Fire
He came up swinging like a Boy Named Sue
And he married June Carter and he fired Stu
He wrote his songs from deep within
And he hit the stage with a crooked grin
He and I were both Highwaymen
And that record became a smash
Well, I'm missing ol' Johnny Cash


Johnny Cash never walked no line
Johnny Cash never did no time, but
When he sang a Folsom Prison Blues
You knew good and well he'd paid his dues
True, he always dressed in black
But he loved folks and they loved him back
Carried his pills in a brown paper sack
Well, I don't care if they found his stash
I'm missin' old Johnny Cash


Now is it really true that him and Roy Nichols, Rose Maddox, some people roasted hot dogs in the back of a limousine with ice cream sticks? I don't know, I said they set the curtains on fire in a English hotel room just to warm their hands. Well. Willie, do you know anything about Cash?


Well, yeah, I know a lot of things about Cash. I'm not sure I should talk about it, but I checked with John, asked him if it's OK, he said he didn't give a shit. One time he took a casket up to his hotel room and got into it and called room service. I thought that was pretty funny


Now Cash had the fire of a thousand men
Loving life was his greatest sin
Treated his fans like the next of kin
Rapping a bit, talking trash
Missing ol' Johnny Cash
