Silly of me to think that I could ever have you for my guy
How I love you... How I want you...
Silly of me to think that you could ever really want me too
How I love you...

You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see
What could it be...
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me

Silly of me to think that you could ever know the things I do
Are all done for you, only for you
Silly of me to take the time to comb my hair and pour the wine
And Know you're not there

You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see
What could it be...
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me

Oh, oh oohohohh.oh

Silly of me to go around and brag about the love I found
And say you're the best, well, I can't tell the rest
AndfFoolish of me to tell them all that every night and day you call
When you could care less

You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see
What could it be...
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me

Oh, oh oohohohh.ohSilly
Oh, oh oohohohh.ohSilly
Oh, oh oohohohh.ohSilly
Oh, oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la... Silly
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... Silly
