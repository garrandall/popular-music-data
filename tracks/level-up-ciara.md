Dangerous!


Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up (Ciara!), level up, level up, level up (Missy!)
Level up, level up, (Fatman Scoop!) level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
 love yourself, level up
Drop that weight, level up, it's time to win, level up


Them old mistakes are gone, I won't do them no more (no more)
That's old news, there's new news, I done did that before
I turned nothing to something, my comeback on one hunnid' (one hunnit')
Less talking, more action, you just gon' see Ci coming
I just keep elevating, no losses, just upgrading
My lessons, made blessings, I turned that into money
Thank God I never settled, this view is so much better
I'm chilling, I'm winning, like on another level


Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stayed prayed up
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all


Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy


Fake friends, I let go
I don't hang with them no mo'
I don't need no promo
I make dollars like Klo-klo
Original, no klepto
Have a new flow, got a new glow
Level up, I'm beautiful
On my ass, bounce like a yo-yo
Eyy, I feel good and fly today
Eyy, and I ain't wlorried about shit, no way
I level up, get money and devil up (that's right)
Now ya'll can't sit with us
Shot gospel, ya'll jealousy


Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stay prayed up
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all


Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy


Me and Ciara, they ain't seen this comin
In the streets, this song is buzzin'
Some of ya'll is talking mumbling
But that shit don't really mean nothing
We level up, level up
Fall down, get up get up
Balls up, boss up
Eyy, eyyu and level up, level up


Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy


Going back, and wind, hit the ground
Oh wind it up, oh round and round
Lets go, throw it back
And walk, hit the ground
Let's go
Wind it up, and go round and round
Level up, level up, level up, all the way up
Level up to the sky, to the sky now
 level up
Get that cash, level up
It's time to win
Dangerous!
