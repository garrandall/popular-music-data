One day you are loving
Like we'll never part
Then you say it's over
Such a change of heart

I go round and round
On the roundabout of love

Sometimes you are gentle
Sometimes very kind
Then without a warning
You can change your mind

I go round and round
On the roundabout of love

I'm going round in circles
What can I do
My love is getting nowhere fast
With you

Even though you promised
To love me evermore
Will I go on waiting
Like I have before

Always going round
Ten feet off the ground
On the roundabout of love with you

I go round and round
On the roundabout of love

I'm going round in circles
What can I do
My love is getting nowhere fast
With you

Even though you promised
To love me evermore
Will I go on waiting
Like I have before

Always going round
Ten feet off the ground
On the roundabout of love with you

La da da da da
