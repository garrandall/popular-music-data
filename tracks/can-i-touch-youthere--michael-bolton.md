Baby, show me what you feel
Come to me, show me somethin' real
I need to know, I need you completely
(closer, baby, closer) Come on closer, baby (let's begin)
Love is takin' over, gotta let it in
Ooh and I need to feel the heart of you
I need to reach the very deepest part of you

Can I touch you there, touch you deep inside
Can I touch your heart, the way you're touchin' mine
Can I touch you there, touch you deep within, oh
Can I touch you there, can I touch you oh...(there)

Oooh Baby, tell me with your eyes
Tell me every secret, darlin'
Every deep desire, till you and I
Are makin' love completely
(closer,baby, closer) come on closer, baby
(can't be close enough)
I can't help the way I hold you
I just hunger for your love
Oooh and I need to feel the heart of you
I need to reach the deepest part of you

Can I touch you there, touch you deep inside
Can I touch your heart, the way you're touchin' mine
Can I touch you there, touch you deep within, oh
Can I touch you there, can I touch you oh...(there)

All I wanna dois touch you, baby
Touch you very soul insideof you
Oooh and I need to feel the heart of you
I need to reach the very deepest part of you
Oh, let me be the one to show you
Just what love can do
Come on, baby, come on

Can I touch you there, touch you deep inside
Can I touch your heart, the way you're touchin' mine
Can I touch you there, touch you deep within, oh
Can I touch you there, can I touch you oh...(there)
