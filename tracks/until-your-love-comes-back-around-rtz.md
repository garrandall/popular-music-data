I thought I spoke to you last evening
I woke up cryin' in my sleep
I dreamed that we were still together
But now I'm back out on the street

I've been runnin' so hard
Tryin' to find the place
Where my baby might be stayin'
I've just gotta see her face

I know there's lots of lonely people
Cryin' all around the world
And this is just another story
About a boy who lost his girl

Well I'm not expecting changes
To happen overnight
But baby if you're listening
Won't you come home and make it right

Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't ever be the same

I hope you're thinking about me baby
Though I don't wish you any pain
But if you miss me like I miss you darlin'
You must be livin' in the rain

I've been runnin' so hard
Tryin' to find the place
Where my baby might be stayin'
I've just gotta see her face

Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't ever be the same

I hope you're thinking about me baby
Though I don't wish you any pain
But if you miss me like I miss you darlin'
You must be livin' in the rain

Well I know we haven't spoken much lately
Lord, but you gotta bring her back to me
I won't make any promises that I can't keep
But you know I'm a better man when I'm not alone you see

Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't ever be the same
