Everybody listen all over the world
I got a story 'bout my favorite girl, wait a minute
Oh, my baby sexy for sure
I had to have him when he walked through the door
Wait a minute
She was 'bout to drive me insane
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains
Wait a minute
I'm focused, but I'm losing control
He only wants me for my body zone


Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute


Minding my business, I was doing my dance (Go, girl)
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance (Wait a minute)
Did I mention he was buying the bar? (Yes, you did)
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard (Wait a minute)
Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need (Yeah)
Droppin' his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees (Wait a minute)
Now he been blowing up my phone like he know me (Oh, no)
Been leaving messages "You know what you owe me"
Oh, no


Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute
Girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute


What is your problem, daddy?
Slow your roll
Who you think you jiving?
You're disturbing my flow (Wait a minute)
Why you be bugging like I'm some kinda hoe?
Got no more questions
Now I want you to go
So break (break)


Ba-da, b-b-ba-da
B-b-ba-da
B-b-ba-da
B-b-ba-da


Hey, let me talk to you for a minute
Shut up, shut up
I love the way you strut
Girl, you already know
But, I'm feeling like you don't want me
You just after my dough
Baby, please, I'm fine
I'm not one of these hoes
Chasing dreams and diamond rings
So don't call me no more


Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey, oh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey, oh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah


Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute
Girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute


See, I don't want your money
Yeah, I seen you rolling up here
In your Cadillac (Wait a minute)
But, I don't need all that
It is a nice color though
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
What they call you, Mr. Tin man or somethin'?
See, I don't want your cars
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
I don't want your jewelry
You can't buy this
So you can keep that (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute...
Uh, yeah, you can give me that back
