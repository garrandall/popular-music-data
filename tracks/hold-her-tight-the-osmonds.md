What is the matter
Now what did you do
Did you go and lose her
Like the others too

Let me tell you something
Here's the way it goes
There's a way to treat em
Everybody knows

Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good

Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Don't let go (don't let go)
If you know (if you know)
No one else can touch her

Everybody tells you
She's the one for you
So if I was you, boy
Here's what I'd do

Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good

Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Don't let go (don't let go)
If you know (if you know)
No one else can touch her

Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good

Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby

Make her feel
Make her feel real good
Give a chance
Give her time to love you
