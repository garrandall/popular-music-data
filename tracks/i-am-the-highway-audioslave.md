Pearls and swine bereft of me.
Long and weary my road has been.
I was lost in the cities, alone in the hills.
No sorrow or pity for leaving, I feel, yeah.

I am not your rolling wheels â I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride â I am the sky.

Friends and liars don't wait for me,
'Cause I'll get on all by myself.
I put millions of miles under my heels;
And still too close to you, I feel, yeah.

I am not your rolling wheels â I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride â I am the sky.

I am not your blowing wind â I am the lightning.
I am not your autumn moon â I am the nightâ¦ the night.

Yeah!
I am not your rolling wheels â I am the highway.
I am not your carpet ride â I am the sky.

Well,
I am not your blowing wind â I am the lightning.
I am not your autumn moon â I am the night... the night.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
