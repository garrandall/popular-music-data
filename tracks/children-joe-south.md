Children
Go and run and jump and play
You'll be
Men and women some day
Then you'll have to leave
Your world of make believe
Now, children

Young (Children)
Carefree (Children)
Children

Children (Children)
Need someone to understand
Children
Need someone to hold their hands
Yeah
To cheer you when you're sad
To spank you when you're bad now
Children

Haughty (Children)
Naughty (Children)
Children

Pride goes before destruction
A holy spirit goes before a fall
Don't you know that we're all children
And it's all for one and one for all, mm

Children (Children)
Call each other names
Children
Playin' grown-up games
And the thing that's really sad
We lose the faith we had
When we were children mm-hm

Loud (Children)
Proud (Children)
Children

Children (Children)
Who think that they are grown
Children
With children of their own
From the cradle to the grave
Why must we all behave like
Children? (Na-na, na-na, na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na)

Lost (Children)
Lonely (Children)
Children

Lost
Lonely
Children

Young
Carefree
Children

Haughty
Naughty
Children

Lost
Lonely
Children
