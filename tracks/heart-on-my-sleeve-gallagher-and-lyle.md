I wear my heart on my sleeve, I'm not afraid
To say what I mean, mean what I say
Set myself up, let myself down
I may be a fool to spread it around


But I just want to let you know
Sometimes I find it so hard not to show
So I sigh and I let my feelings go


Oh I wear my heart on my sleeve, don't count the cost
If I can't live in love, then surely I've lost
Oh you tend to get burn, tend to get bruised
But it's my life, the way that I choose


And I just wanna let you know
Sometimes I find it so hard not to show
Oh don't sigh, baby you're not alone

I wear my heart on my sleeve (4x)



Wear your heart on your sleeve (8x)
(Repeat until fade)
