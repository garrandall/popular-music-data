She loves her man
And lets him know every way she can
Soul on soul, hand in hand
Together

She knows his mind
Every way, all the time
Soul on soul, hand in hand
Together (together)

Mmm, oh yeah

She stands along
All the way, right or wrong
'Cause one and one, twice as strong, yeah
Together

She
She
She's a woman
She
She
She
She
