I pull up to the yard in hard light
That's where I find you, how I find you

We get into the car, feel it start
Under the street lights, flashing red lights

We don't have to go far, cross my heart
Roll the windows, got the windows down

We're the wanderers
Passing fields, wheat sunlit to gold
We're the wanderers
Catch the moon, turn stone lake to chrome

Then at the local bar we'll play the part
Put down your quarter, blood and water

Everyone knows your tricks and business
It's why they love you, how they love you

The rest is just for kicks, kicks
Let's roll out now
Power up the sound

We're the wanderers
Passing fields, wheat sunlit to gold
We're the wanderers
Catch the moon, turn stone lake to chrome

We're the wanderers
Twist in the road, nowhere to call home
We're the wanderers
Never to want what we can't let go

Everything has to end, it's 2:10
Your mother worries, head full of stories

She doesn't like your friends, but then
It doesn't matter, window to ladder

The night will come again
Just the weekend
Just the weekend

We're the wanderers
Passing fields, wheat sunlit to gold
We're the wanderers
Catch the moon, turn stone lake to chrome

We're the wanderers
Never to want what we can't let go
We're the wanderers
Twist in the road, nowhere to call home
