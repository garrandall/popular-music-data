(Summer souvenirs, summer souvenirs, remind me of you)

The castles we built on secluded beaches
(These are my summer souvenirs)
The hills that we climbed like mountain ewes
(These are my summer souvenirs)
The magic of moments we spent together
These memories are summer souvenirs.

The picture of you sitting by the fire
(These are my summer souvenirs)
The times that I kissed away your tears
(These are my summer souvenirs)
The picnics and rides that we took at Playland
These memories are summer souvenirs.

The last words of love whispered at the station
(These are my summer souvenirs)
I'll hear them forever through the years.
(These are my summer souvenirs)
The train as it left me alone without you
These memories are summer souvenirs.
These memories are golden souvenirs.
