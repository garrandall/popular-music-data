I've had a lot of girls in my life
They never meant that much to me
A good time was always had by all
But those good times, they were fleeting memories
I used to lie to them and then I'd kiss them
But I kept them an arm's length away
Well hey man now you know me
And look how silly I been acting today

This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love
This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love

I used to roll down the window
And let that tape deck blow
And look at the honey I was holding that night
I'd say, "Hey girl you're the one"
And then I'd laugh when I'd take her home
You got your arms around my shoulders
You got my soul confused with my heart
You were too smart to believe all those tired lines
And I was too dumb to know what had started

This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love
This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love

I hope you don't lose that innocent laughter
I hope time doesn't take that away

This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love
This time I really think I'm in love, I'm in love
This time I think I'm really in love
