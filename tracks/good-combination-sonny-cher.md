Baby don't you worry
When things ain't going right
Don't be in a hurry
To run away when you're uptight
Love is sweet if we stick together
Solve our problems for forever


Cause we got a good combination
Yeah we got a good combination
Can't you see you and me
Got the key to be happy
Yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah
Yeah oh yeah

Baby when you're crying
I'll love your tears away
And I will always be trying
To keep you happy through the years
As long as we just keep on kissing
There's nothing in the world
We won't be missing



As long as we just keep on kissing
There's nothing in the world
We won't be missing



Yeah (We got a good combination)
Yeah (We got a good combination)
Yeah (We got a good combination)
Yeah (We got a good combination)
Yeah (We got a good combination)
