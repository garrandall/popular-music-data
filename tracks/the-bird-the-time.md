Hold on, hold on, why y'all beatin' on shit, what's that mean?
Hold up, do y'all wanna learn a new dance?
Are you qualified to learn one? That's what I thought
Who can dance out there? Okay, we gonna try a new dance
And if I don't see everybody doin' it, I don't wanna see you no more
Jellybean, are we ready? Y'all better do this one
What time is it? Alright, y'all got 10 seconds
To get to the dance floor...and...squawk!


America, have you heard?
I got a brand new dance and it's called "The Bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality
You just need two arms and an attitude
And everybody sing with me, come on now


Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa


Brothers, don't be cool
Women like it sometimes when you act a fool
Sisters, don't be shy
Let your body get loose, you ain't too fat to fly
Come on now


Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa
Ya'll sing it with me, just like this
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa


Yes, hold on now, this dance ain't for everybody
Just the sexy people
White folks, you're much too tight
You gotta shake your head like the black folks
You might get some tonight, look out


America, have you heard?
Got a sexy new dance it's called "The Bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality
You just need two arms and attitude
And everybody sing with me, come on now


Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa, come on
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa, everybody
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa, come on
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa


Alright, when the horns blow
I want everybody on the floor
You know this groove is sexy
You ain't got no excuse no more
Jerome, I wanna show 'em where we live
Siamese twins joined at the suit
Fellas, give me something to fly with, squawk!



The Wright brothers can't fuck with that
Jerome, bring me my hat
Did I mess my hair up?
Fellas, y'all play something
I'mma go over here and talk to this girl



I pledge allegiance to the time
Can y'all sing that? Sing it
I said, I pledge allegiance to the time


Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa
Squawk! Hallelujah! Whoa


Fellas? Yeah
What's the word? Squawk!
When you wanna get some
What'd you do? Do "The Bird"

Fellas? Yeah
What's the word? Squawk!
When you wanna get some
What'd you do? Do "The Bird"

America? Yeah
What's the word? Squawk!
When you wanna get some
What'd you do? Do "The Bird"
Take it home! Squawk!

Squawk!
Chili sauce

It's the last call for alcohol
If you ain't got what you want
You got to get the hell outta here
Thank you!
