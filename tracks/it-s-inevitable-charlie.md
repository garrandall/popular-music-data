She's good by me, sitting on the couch watching games on a Sunday
We're out on the lake soaking in them sun rays (Whoa-ah)
I ain't gotta lie, she's straight, when me and the boys decide to do our thing
I'd spend every dime I made on her but she only wants me
Now she ain't the fancy type but she can go from boots to heels in no time (That's right)
And either way, she's fine, yeah

T-shirt with the messy bun
Perfect with no make up on
Every dude turn their head when she walks by
The look in her eyes
Gets me every time
Boots on with the cotton dress
Makes it look so effortless, yeah
She's irreplaceable
Yeah she's every kind of beautiful

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, she's every kind of beautiful

Oh, she's fly, hotter than a pepper picked in July (Tsss)
When she cracks that smile, she's grabbin' a hold of my heart (Whoa-ah)
She's my lucky charm, so I gotta keep her wrapped in my arms
She don't mean no harm but them guys staring got their women jealous
When she cuts her eyes at me, she got me on fire
And I'm so glad she's mine-ine-ine-ine-ine

T-shirt with the messy bun
Perfect with no make up on
Every dude turn their head when she walks by
The look in her eyes
Gets me every time
Boots on with the cotton dress
Makes it look so effortless, yeah
She's irreplaceable
Yeah she's every kind of beautiful

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, she's every kind of beautiful

She's so respectable
So us being together is inevitable
I mean, it's so refreshing
To not be question or second guessing
The way she feels inside or out
Does she have my heart? Without a doubt
Whenever I'm gone she holds me down
And holds me close when I'm around
In her...

T-shirt with the messy bun
Perfect with no make up on
Every dude turn their head when she walks by
The look in her eyes
Gets me every time
Boots on with the cotton dress
Makes it look so effortless, yeah
She's irreplaceable
Yeah she's every kind of beautiful
