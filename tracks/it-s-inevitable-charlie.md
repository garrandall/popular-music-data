Don't tell me you ain't
Noticed I'm always around
I've seen you looking
You always know just
Where I'll be found

Our eyes meet
That smile you can't hide
Tells me what you're feeling inside
Those eyes cannot lie


It's inevitable
Like the heat of the sun
It's inevitable
I'm gonna make you the one
It's inevitable
Like the fire in your touch
It's inevitable
Cause I want you
I want you so much

You sit talking with friends
But you're looking for me
I ain't fooling myself
This is no fantasy

Bodies talk louder than words
You're talking and I overheard
Emotions are stirred



I watch him standing with you
But there's a spark in your eye
So let's rendezvous
It's time that you realize

You gotta follow your heart
You gotta make every second count
Stop fooling around, come to me

So don't tell me you ain't
Noticed I'm always around
I've seen you looking
You always know just
Where I'll be found

It's only a matter of time
Don't fight it
You can't run this time
You're gonna be mine
