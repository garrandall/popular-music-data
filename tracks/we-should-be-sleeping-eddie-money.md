We should be sleeping now
We're wide awake, but we're dead on our feet
We're never keeping, no
All of the promises we said we'd keep

Four in the morning
Still got the lights and the radio on
Don't worry, baby
I'm gonna change all the things that went wrong, now

We should be sleeping
Tables are turned and it's, it's breaking my heart
Things will get better (I promise you, honey)
I'll end this nightmare before it can start

Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby"
Why should we break down and cry?
Can't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say, "Bye, baby bye-bye, now"
Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye, baby, now"

We should be sleeping
We're still wide awake, but we're dead on our feet, now
We're never keeping, now
All of the promises we said we'd keep

Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby"
Why should we break down and cry?
Can't let the world drive you crazy, hey
Don't say, "Bye, baby, bye-bye"

No deposit, no return
Play with love, you're gonna burn
Cheat yourself, you cheat your heart

We should be sleeping

Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby"
Why should we break down and cry?
Don't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say, "Bye, baby, bye-bye, now"
Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye, baby, now"

Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby"
Why should we break down and cry?
Don't let the world drive you crazy, oh no
Don't say, "Bye, baby, bye-bye"

Don't say, "Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby"
Why should we break down and cry?
Don't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say, "Bye, baby, bye-bye"
