(Gonna hit it)
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
(Oh yeah)
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
(Oh yeah)
Ski-doom-dah

Bottoms up, it's too hot in here
Where's the fire truck when you need o-one
I want a firm foundation, a knockout derriere
I can't believe that my eyes are gaspin' for air

Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor
No kids in the candy store, get a lollipop at the door
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor

A bedrocker anytime, gotta keep, gotta keep it on the level
(A bedrocker)
Lay it low, with feet sky high
(Lay it low, feet sky high)
When you drive a wide load, you better go for what you know

Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor
So much to explore, I'm gonna hit the floor
I'm gonna hit the floor, I'm gonna hit the floor

Earthquake shakes whenever you move
The word heart breaker describes you
Nice full back, there just waitin' to score
A stallion to break, so whatever it takes

Got my boots, got my hat, got my ridin' pants
To enhance the romantic circumstance
With you, you, ah, it's all I want

Here we go, I'm gonna hit the floor, so much to explore
Here I go, I'm gonna hit the floor
Soon as I hit the door, I won't be no more
I won't get, you're sexy undies under the door

Whatever you want, whatever you need
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna give it, just let me rule it
(Yeah)

Gonna hit the, gonna hit the floor
Earthquake shakes whenever you move
The word heartbreaker describes you
Nice full back just waiting to score
I tell you what I'm gonna do
