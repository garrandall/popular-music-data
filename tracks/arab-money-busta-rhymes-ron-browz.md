Ron Browz, yes! 
Oh, we back in the most amazin' way 
Well, lemme introduce you to the new talk 
Let's get straight to it 
C'mon! 

 
Shalai Lai Lai Halilili Hai Lo! 
Hi Li Ba Lai Hey Hi Li Bai Lo! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
Ha La Shiki Hai Lili Ba La! 
Milli Ai Lai Shi Lili Ba La! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 

 
Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead 
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread 
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf 
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louie Scarf 
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough 
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft 
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit 
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic! 

 
Shalai Lai Lai Halilili Hai Lo! 
Hi Li Ba Lai Hey Hi Li Bai Lo! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
Ha La Shiki Hai Lili Ba La! 
Milli Ai Lai Shi Lili Ba La! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 

 
Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick 
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit 
Women walk around while security on camelback 
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act 
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat 
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac 
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin' 
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim 

 
Shalai Lai Lai Halilili Hai Lo! 
Hi Li Ba Lai Hey Hi Li Bai Lo! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
Ha La Shiki Hai Lili Ba La! 
Milli Ai Lai Shi Lili Ba La! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 

 
See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy 
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now 
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke 
So much cake even the money look weird too 
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right 
Prince Alwali, Bin Talal, Al Saul 
They respect the value of my worth in Maui, Malaysia 
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia! 

 
Shalai Lai Lai Halilili Hai Lo! 
Hi Li Ba Lai Hey Hi Li Bai Lo! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
Ha La Shiki Hai Lili Ba La! 
Milli Ai Lai Shi Lili Ba La! 
We gettin' Arab money! 
We gettin' Arab money!
