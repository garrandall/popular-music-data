When the lady smiles,
You know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips,
Go drawing circles in the night
Then the mood is soft and sensual, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
It's the answer to all my dreams
Every time it feels like the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin', 
I hear it shatter,
Maybe it's raining, faster and faster, shadow dancin'
Together oh I, I'm a bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at me
And I'm feelin' proud

When the lady smiles,
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact,
She could always let me down
But when the lady smiles,
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact,
I don't resist at all
'cos I'm walking on clouds
And she is leadin' the way

My friends tell me,
She's the beast inside your paradise
I guess you've heard it all before
A fallen angel,
That has got you hypnotized
And that always needs some more, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
She's done nothin' to mislead me
'cos every time we meet,
The earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin'
I hear it shatter , maybe it's rainin'
Faster and faster, shadow dancin'
Together oh I, I'm bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at mea
Nd I'm feeling proud

When the lady smiles,
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact, she could always let me down
But when the lady smiles,
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact,
I don't resist at all
'cos we're walkin' on clouds
And she is leadin' the way

Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo......
