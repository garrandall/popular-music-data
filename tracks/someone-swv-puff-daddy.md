Lookin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
For SWV to drop a jam on mine
Playa's talk the talk but they can't walk it
We make the whole country bounce when we New York it
Don't speak about it, be about it
Seein' Puff on your tube, feelin' weak about it
I got the skill of an actor, wind chill factor
Minus five five, coolest man alive
Baby, who dat is? Oh, that's just Puff Daddy
Keep you on my mind, like I keep me on my shine
And I feel fine
Sex real time
While I'm in your deck on rewind
Oh I make it hot, till you're jellin' what PD got
Since PD rock, see me not
So many bricks I build a tenament
We'll do the freaky thing baby girl
If you're into it


I'm looking for a lover that
Can make a sacrifice
A lover that will understand
Will always be by my side
I pray the Lord so I can find
My Mr. Right
So who can it be the one for me
I need

1 - Someone that I can believe
Someone to satisfy me
I need love
Someone who's faithful and true
Oh baby, can it be you
I need love

Oh, can it be that you're the one
And I've been too blind to see
You're everything I'll ever need
Someone will love me for me
I wanna know, I wanna see
My destiny
If your love is true I'll love you too
Cuz I need

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

2 - You could be the one
Love of a lifetime
Oh baby can it be the one for me
I need to know
Want you to be mine
Baby, why can't you be my everything


Check this out
You all know the Steve's, SWV's
Gone for a minute
Chillin' cross seas
Back on the scene
Pocket full of cream, now
Gone so long thought they was locked in the Penile
Meanwhile
They be bumpin' in the clubs
Can we get freaky tonight, sho' 'nuff
Puff and J-Dub
Platinium stats, plush oriental rugs, and platinium plaques
Come on

Repeat 2
Repeat 1
