If I reach out to you
Like a child would do
Darling, don't let me down
I need you so and
I guess you know that
I'm too far gone to turn around
If I give you my heart
Please don't tear it apart
Don't treat me like dirt
From the ground
Give me a break
For Heaven's sake, cause
I'm too far gone to turn around
I'm too far gone
Too far gone, stop
I'm flying high like
The bird in the sky
Darling, don't let me drop
I'm begging you
Whatever you do
Don't turn my life upside down
I love you so
And I guess you know
I'm too far gone to turn around
I'm too far gone to turn around
(I'm too far gone to turn around)
