You walked right by me
Like you never knew ooh ooh me
You didn't even nod your head
You just walked out with her instead

Remember me, remember me, eeh yeah

I'm the girl you used to hold
Now I'm the girl out in the cold
When I saw her by your side
I felt like I was about to die

Remember me, remember me, eeh yeah

Ah, don't you remember the love you shared
Yeah yeah yeah
Don't you remember the way you cared

For you our love was just a game
But I'll never be the same
You hurt more than my pride
You let the hurt deep inside

Remember me, remember me,
Remember me, remember me...
