Your arms are warm but they make me feel
As if they're made of cold, cold steel
A simple kiss like a turnin' key
A little click and the lock's on me

Can't move my arms
Can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
But I know baby

I'm in chains
I'm in chains

I pretend I can always leave
Free to go whenever I please
But then the sound of my desperate calls
Echo off these dungeon walls

I've crossed the line from mad to sane
A thousand times and back again
I love you baby

I'm in chains
I'm in chains
I'm in chains
I'm in chains

Should have known passin' through the gate
That once inside I could not escape
I never thought this could happen to me
I never thought this is where I'd be

But baby, baby
Baby, look at me
I said baby, baby, look at me

I'm in chains
Baby, baby, I'm in chains
I'm in chains
Baby, baby, I'm in chains

I never thought this is where I'd be
I never thought that this could happen to me

Chains

Baby, baby, I'm in chains
Chains
Baby look at me
Baby, baby, I'm in chains
I'm in chains
Baby, baby, I'm in chains

Oh, ah, oh ah

Chains
Baby, baby, I'm in chains
Chains
Baby, baby, I'm in chains
Hey, hey
