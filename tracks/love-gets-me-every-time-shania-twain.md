Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry-had no worries
Stayin' single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered-'til I discovered 
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it 

Gone and done it (gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)
I guess I- - - gol' darn gone and done it 

I was quite content
Just a-payin' my own rent
It was my place-I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I had it covered-'til I discovered 

That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it 

Gone and done it (gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)
I guess I- - - gol' darn gone and done it 

Love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it 

Gone and done it (gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)
It's in the way he calls my name (gone and done it)
I know I'll never be the same (gone and done it) 

Love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it 

Thought I had it covered
Life was going great
Well I gol' darn gone and done it
