Don't make me over
Now that I'd do
Anything for you

Don't make me over
Now that you know how
I adore you

Don't pick on the things
I say, the things I do
Just love me with all my faults
That way that I love you
I'm begging you

Don't make me over
Now that I can't
Make it without you

Don't make me over
I wouldn't change
One thing about you

Just take me inside your
Arms and hold me tight
And always be by my side
Wether I'm wrong or right
I'm begging you

Don't make me over
Don't make me over
Now that you've got me
At your command

Accept me for what I am

Lyrics courtesy Top40db

Accept me for all the
Things that I do
Accept me for what I am
Accept me for all the
Things that I do

(Now that I can't
Make it without you)
(I wouldn't change
One thing about you)

Accept me for what I am
Accept me for all the
Things that I do
Accept me for what I am
Accept me for all the
Things that I do

Accept me for what I am
Oh, please accept me.....
