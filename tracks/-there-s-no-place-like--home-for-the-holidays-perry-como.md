Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee, he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania, folks are travelling 
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific
Gee, the traffic is terrific

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home

Take a bus, take a train
Go and hop an aeroplane
Put the wife and kiddies in the family car
For the pleasure that you bring 
When you make that doorbell ring
No trip could be too far

I met a man who lives in Tennessee, he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie (some pumpkin pie) 
From Pennsylvania, folks are travelling 
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific
Gee, the traffic is terrific

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
