I am the Candyman - Coming from Bountyland
I am the Candyman - Coming from Bountyland!

I wish that you were my Lollipop
Sweet things, I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree,
will you give me a sodapop for free?

Come with me Honey,
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman
Run like the wind - fly with me to Bountyland
Bite me, I'm yours - if you're hungry please understand
This is the end - of the sweet sugar Candyman

Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - your word is my command
Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - let us fly to Bountyland

You are my Lollipop - sugar sugar top
You are my Lollipop - sugar sugar top

I wish that I were a Bubble Gum,
chewing on me, baby, all day long
I will be begging for sweet delight,
until you say I'm yours tonight

Come with me Honey,
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman
Run like the wind - fly with me to Bountyland
Bite me, I'm yours - if you're hungry please understand
This is the end - of the sweet sugar Candyman

Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - your word is my command
Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - let us fly to Bountyland

Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
and oh my love - your word is my command
Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - let us fly to Bountyland

I am the Candyman - Coming from Bountyland
I am the Candyman - Coming from Bountyland!

Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - your word is my command
Oh my love - I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love - let us fly to Bountyland

You are my Lollipop - sugar sugar top
You are my Lollipop - sugar sugar top
