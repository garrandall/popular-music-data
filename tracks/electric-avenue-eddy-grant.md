Boy!
Boy!


Now in the street there is violence
And a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out the washin'
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

:
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher


Workin' so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on TV
Deep in my heart I abhor ya
Can't get food for the kid, good God


We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh, Lord


We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher


Who is to blame in one country?
Never can get to the one
Dealin' in multiplication
And they still can't feed everyone, oh no


We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho no, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher


Ho, out in the street
Out in the street
Out in the daytime
Out in the night


Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher


Out in the street
Out in the street
Out in the playground
In the dark side of town


Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Hey, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher


Rock it in the daytime
Rock it in the night
Rock it Miami, mama, meh
Whoa, in a Brixton
