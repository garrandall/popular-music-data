Oh, there's good and bad things about the south, boy
Oh, and some leave a bitter taste in my mouth, now
Yeah, like the black man livin' across the track
White men were on the other side holdin' him back
Way back home, now


Oh, but we won't talk about that 'cause it's understood
Ev'rybody sees the bad, but what about the good?
Ooh, I'd give anything just to smell that scent
Of honeysuckle growin' on a backyard fence
Way back home, now


Oh, heaven sent, ya'll
(Way back home)
Yeah, way back home
(Way back home)
Yeah, back home, back home
I'd love to smell the wetness of grass and trees
And see flowers kissed by honey bees
Like way back home, now


Oh, but childhood days are dead 'n gone
Well, but the memories still linger on
Oh, have you ever gone swimmin' in a muddy creek
With nothin' on your body from head to feet?
Way back home, yeah


How you play for the game like hide and seek
Yeah, and snake through the weeds overhear the streams
Well, I know some kids still play those games
But when they play it just ain't the same
Like way back home
Sad to sing it, ya'all!


Yeah
Way back home, way back home
(Way back home)
Way back
Oh, I really miss those things that have faded away
I remember them like it was yesterday
Now, way back home
(Way back home)
(Way back home)
(Way back home)
(Way back home)

~
