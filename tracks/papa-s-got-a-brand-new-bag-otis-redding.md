Come here, sister
Papa's in the thing
Ain't too hip
On that new breed thing
It ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag


He's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
You know he's not shy
He's doing the fly
The Mash Potato, The Alligator
Jump back, Jack
See you later, alligator


Come here, sister
Papa's in the thing
Ain't too hip
On that new breed thing
Ain't no drag
Papa's bought himself a brand new bag


Come on now, hey, hey
Come on, he's out of sight
He's uptight
Come on and groove me
Oh, you're out of sight
Papa, got a, brand new, bag
Papa, got it
Papa, got it
Got it, got it, bought it, got it
Blow it, man; blow it



Got it, got it, got it
Papa, got a, brand new, bag
Soul man, soul
Groovin', he's uptight
He outta sight
Mister Redding, that's my name
Got it, yeah

He's doing the Twist
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
You know he's not shy
The Mash Potato, The Alligator
Jump back Jack
See you later, alligator


Come here, sister
Papa's in the thing
Ain't too hip
On that new breed thing
Ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag


Come on now, hey, hey
Come on, hey hey
Jerk, Jerk, hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Gotta, gotta, groovin', we're groovin'
We're groovin', we're groovin'


Come here, sister
Papa's in the thing
Ain't too hip
On that new breed thing
Ain't no drag
My mammy's got a brand new bag


Come on now, hey, hey
Comin', comin'
Got it, I got it
It's in my feet, I got it
It's in my head, I got it
On my shoulder, I got it
In my knee, I got it
The backbone, I got it
The shoulders again, I got it
Soul man, I got it
Soul man, I got it
Soul man, I got it

Okay, you got it, you got it
