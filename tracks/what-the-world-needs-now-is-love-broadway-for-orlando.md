What the world needs now is love sweet love
It's the only thing that there's just too little of.
What the world needs now is love sweet love
No not just for some but for everyone.

Lord we don't need another mountain,
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb,
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last until the end of time

What the world needs now is love sweet love,
It's the only thing that there's just too little of,
What the world needs now is love sweet love,
No not just for some but for everyone

Lord, we don't need another meadow,
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow,
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine,
Oh listen Lord, if you want to know

What the world needs now is love sweet love,
Its the only thing that there's just too little of.
What the world needs now is love sweet love,
No not just for some, oh but just for every every everyone.

What the world (whoa whoa) needs now,
Is love (is love) sweet love
What the world (oh oh) needs now
Is love (is love) sweet love
What the world (whoa whoa) needs now
Is love (is love) sweet love
