Can this be true? Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
And how can it be, that been right here with me
There's an Angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret, that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must of spent a little more time on you

A little more time
I'm sure He did
And yes He did that

In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

And I'm trying hard to figure out, just how I ever did without
Oh the warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified

Your love is like a river peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I'll know that it's true
God must of spent a little more time on you

A little more time on you
Yes He did so
Yes He did

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you change my world with just one kiss
And how can it be that right here with me
There's an Angel, is just a miracle

Your love is like a river peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret, that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must of spent a little more time on you
God must have spent a little more time on you, on you
A little more time on you, you
