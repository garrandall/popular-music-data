Sheâs watching the taxi driver, he pulls away
Sheâs been locked up inside her apartment a hundred days

She says, âYeah, heâs still coming, just a little bit late.
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape.â
Sheâs just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh the way she smiles

Sheâs talking to angels,
Counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Sheâs dancing with strangers,
Falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
Waiting for Superman

Sheâs out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothingâs making sense
Sheâs been chasing an answer, a sign lost in the abyss,
This Metropolis

She says, "Yeah, heâs still coming, just a little bit late.
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day.â
She says, "If life was a movie, then it wouldnât end like this,
Left without a kiss."
Still, she smiles, oh, the way she smiles, yeah

Sheâs talking to angels,
Counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Sheâs dancing with strangers,
Sheâs falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
Sheâs waiting for Superman...

...to lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love and flying through the air
Save her now before itâs too late tonight
Oh, at the speed of light
And she smiles

Sheâs talking to angels,
Counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Sheâs dancing with strangers,
Sheâs falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
Sheâs waiting for Superman...

...to lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love, oh, and flying through the air
Save her now before itâs too late tonight
Sheâs waiting for Superman
