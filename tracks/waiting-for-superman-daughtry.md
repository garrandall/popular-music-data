She's watching the taxi driver, he pulls away
She's been locked up inside her apartment 100 days
She says "Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape"
She's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh, the way she smiles


She's talking to angels, counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers, falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
Waiting for Superman


She's out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothing's making sense
She's been chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss, this Metropolis
She says "Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day
She says, "If life was a movie, then it wouldn't end like this
Left without a kiss"
Still, she smiles, oh, the way she smiles, yeah


She's talking to angels, she's counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers, she's falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
She's waiting for Superman


To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love
Flying through the air
Save her now before it's too late tonight
Oh, at the speed of light
And she smiles


She's talking to angels, she's counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers, she's falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, oh, in his arms, yeah
She's waiting for Superman


To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love
Flying through the air
Save her now before it's too late tonight
She's waiting for Superman
