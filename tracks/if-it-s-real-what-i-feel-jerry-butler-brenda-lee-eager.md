Gotta let you know just how I feel
Gotta let you know
I need a love that's real

But until that day comes
We're gonna keep on having fun

And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you, oh, baby
And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you, I bet you

Girl, we're having
Such a wonderful time
Ooh, you're putting
Something on my mind

There's so many things
In this world to see
I've never seen before

There are so many places
In this big old world
That I know I've got to go
But I'm never gonna erase
The look of love upon your face

And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you, yeah, baby
And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you
Let's do it again

Gotta let you know just how I feel
Gotta let you know
I need a love that's real

But until that day comes
We're gonna keep on having fun

There's so much to see
And so much to hear
(Let me tell you) that a
Young girl like me should hear
(Oh, Lord) and I believe
When it's all said and done
I'll be coming home to you, my dear

But if I hold you too much longer
Baby, I'm gonna be a goner

And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you, oh, baby
And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you
Yes, I am, say it again

And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you
And if it's real what I feel
I'm coming back to get you

Go ahead on
If it's real what I feel (oh, baby)
If it's real what I feel
What you gonna do about it
If it's real what I feel
Oh, what you gonna do
If it's real what I feel
What you gonna do about it

I'm gonna get on home (come on)
I'm coming on home (come on)
I'm coming on home
I'm coming on home...
