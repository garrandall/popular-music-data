I know
I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try

Find a reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for me

I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different

And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for love

Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, the past behind us
Then we're on our way

Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes

You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, you should kick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
