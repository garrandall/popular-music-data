Oh, yeah


Lived all my days
Trying to embrace
Life with my heart
By all the beauty I feel and create

It spins and moves
Flows at my pace
Telling its story
From the tear running down my face


Visions of a sunset
Just appear when I close my eyes
Takes me closer to heaven
When the flute starts to fly
And the violin cries


Confusion leaves
While peace orchestrates
Runs through my veins
And in other seekers

It penetrates my reason
Why the big city air smells so sweet
Takes me through journeys in time
From my youth to as far as I can see




It's all I need
In my life
It's all I need
And no one can take your place
By my side
You're all inside of me



We'll free from all sorrow
Like the wind blows from the sky
Takes me closer to heaven
When the flute starts to fly
