I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Yeah it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in parking lot
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like drivin' backwards in the fog
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything


The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget


I like gypsy moths and radio talk
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything


The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
Don't wanna learn what I'll need...


Bend and shape me I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly like never before
Calm and sleeping we won't stir up the past
So discreetly we won't look back




The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need


I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything
