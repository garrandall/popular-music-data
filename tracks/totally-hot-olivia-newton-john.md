I want you
But takin' it easy ain't an easy thing to do
And I want you, want you
You must know
Cause baby I can't begin to keep it in

Our love is so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Gimme what you got, ready or not
Our love is totally hot

I'm burnin' up
And if my mama could read my mind she'd lock me up
And I'm burnin', burnin'
You must know
Cause baby when you're around I come unwound

Our love is so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Gimme what you got, ready or not
Out love is totally hot

Play the game and let me do the same
And we gonna get along, gonna get along, gonna get along fine
Watchin' out for my heart
But when I am near you
Near you ain't the place to start, no, no, no, no
Takin' it slow
Whenever I cross your trail, my brakes just fail

My love is so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Gimme what you got, ready or not
My love is totally hot

My love is so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot
You got to me
Gimme what you got, ready or not
My love is totally hot
Gimme what you got, ready or not
My love is totally, totally, totally hot
