Oh oh boy, oh oh boy
Don't let him sway you away from me
Don't let him say bad things about me
Don't let him tell you that I'm no good for you, oh no boy
He's only tryin' to break us up, tryin' to make you mad
He's about to make you lose the best love you've ever had
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy

Listen to your heart & not his words
I knew from the start that he was against us
Please don't think that I've been untrue to you, oh no boy
Although he treats you nice & claims to be your friend
He's always askin' me if he can call me now & then
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy

(instrumental)

I tell that you must have faith in me
Give me your trust & I'll never betray you
But don't let him say I'm not the girl for you, oh no boy
He's only jealous, can't you read between the lines?
Every time you turn your back he's tryin' to break your time
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy, use your head
Don't let him say bad things about me
Tell him you're no good without me
Come on, use your head
