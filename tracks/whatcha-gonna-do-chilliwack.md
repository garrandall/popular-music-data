Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

There's no time for changing plans
I must leave, it's in your hands
I know you'll wait for how long
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

When I'm away you're gonna have a good time
What can I say? Will you remember you're mine?
What will you do when they wanna touch ya?
What will you do when they wanna get you?
I know what they'll do
If you ever let 'em, are you gonna let 'em?

Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

When the boys all come to call
Will you take them in at all?
Or will you send them far away?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

Why don't you run and do what you wanna do
Ain't nothin' wrong 'cause I'll be doing it too
If you give in I don't wanna hear it
And if he wins I don't wanna see it
Whatever you do maybe you can hide it
Try to keep it quiet

Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

And when it's night and I'm not there
When the cold is in the air
Will you make the best of it?
Someone there to keep you warm

Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

Where're you gonna be when I'm gone?
Who will be with you?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Where're you gonna be when I'm gone?
Who will be with you?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?

Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone?
