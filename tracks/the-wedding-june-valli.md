Here I stand
His ring
Is on my hand
But he's second best
In my heart

He loves me so
Dear Lord
Don't let him know
I'm only playing
A part

Here I stand
My ring is on her hand
But I know she's playing
A part
I need her so
I'm right for her I know
But I'm second best
In her heart

(How handsome the groom) There they stand
(How lovely the bride) His ring is on her hand
(How faithful the friend as he stands by their side) But once once I was first in her heart
(How happy a wedding?) I made her see a friend I'd always be
(This?) I've loved someone else from the start

Dear Lord above
Inspire me with a love
So strong
That the past (Dear Lord above)
Will depart (Let me stand by her side)
Don't let me rest
Until the second best
Is truly the first
In my heart
The first
And last
In my heart
