I should have learned this lesson long ago
That friends and lovers always come and go
And now you claim that everything's O.K.
But I've got just one thing to say

Why don't you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another, find another
Find another fool to love you
To love you
Find another

I don't believe that I deserve this ride
You took me for my very heart and pride
You let me down and now your hand is out
Well, here's some spare change you can count

Why don't you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another, find another
Find another fool to love you
To love you
Find another

You pulled this once, you pulled it twice
It's time you listened to my advice
Oh, baby

I'd never take advantage of our love
I can't imagine what you're thinkin' of
You're overdue, you think this storm is through
Well, baby, I've got news for you

Why don't you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another (find another)
Find another fool to love you
Find another, find another
Find another fool to love you
To love you
Find another
