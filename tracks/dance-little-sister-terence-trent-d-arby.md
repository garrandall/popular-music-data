Get up 'outta' your rockin' chair, grandma!
Or rather would you care to dance, grandmother?

Hey you!
Give up to the ghost that's haunting you now
Shout it out
Don't let it stay inside and eat you alive

Make up your mind
Don't you want to stay this side of the line?
I can assure you when you're my age
You'll learn from all you've left behind

(You've got to)
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
I don't wanna hear you're late

Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
Don't give up your stay

Say now
Share the weight and lay your cross down
And let the long reaching arm
Of hope bring you around

It ain't easy but giving up
Is the easy thing to do
Time is on your side
Would you just watch the clock and let it tick for you?

(You've got to)
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
I don't wanna hear you're late

Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
Don't give up your stay
