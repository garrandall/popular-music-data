Huhuuuhuhuhuhuuuuuuh, hu!
You move it to the left, yeah, and you go for yourself.
You move it to the right, yeah, if it takes all night.
Now take it kinda slow,
with a whole lot of soul.
Don't move it too fast.
Just make it last.
You scratch just like a monkey.
Yeah ya do, real cool.
You slide it to the limbo.
Yeah, how low can you go?
Now come on baby, come on baby!
Don't fall down on me now.
Just move it right here to the Harlem Shuffle.
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Meooow. Ooh haoooh!
Hitch me hitch hike baby, across the floor.
Whow, whow, whow, I can't stand it no more.
Now come on, baby (oh, come on baby!), now get into your slide.
Just ride, ride, ride little pony ride.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
(Do the Monkey Shine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shake your tail feather, baby.
(Shake shake, shake shake yeah!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shake your tail feather, baby.
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Yeah, like your momma told you how.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh, do the Harlem Shuffle.
Do it, do it do your own, own shine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem Shuffle.
