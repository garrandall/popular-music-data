Under the Influence of Love

Walkin' on a cloud
Feeling high
It happens every time
Whenever I'm with my guy

Tripping on love
And it feels so good
I can't help myself
And I wouldn't think I could

Plus he's got that certain drive
That I'm a victim to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I'd rather do

Oh, I'm right Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And I know I just can't live without it

Need another dose
Can't get enough
I've just got to have
All of my baby's love

And, when I'm alone
Feeling sad and blue
He gives me a shot of love
And I'm as good as new

Helpless as I am
Ask me, I don't care
His tenderness is what I miss
Whenever he's not here

Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And I know I just can't live without it

There just ain't no one else
Who can bring out the love in me
So many guys have tried
They've tried to catch my eye
But he's the only one I see

Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And I know I just can't live without it

Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love
And, I know there ain't no doubt about it
