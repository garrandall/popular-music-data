Sugarland, warm breeze blowing, long dirt road
First time that I saw him was such a long time ago
I was sixteen going on seventeen
Blue bonnet Texas queen fell in love with a rodeo king
Down in Sugarland

Drive in movies, hot summer night
First time that I kissed him made the world seem right
I was city bound couldn't wait to get outta this town
Suddenly everything just changed
Something told me I just might stay
Down in sugarland

Down in sugarland doing the best we can
Holding hands staying up all night
Swinging stars from satelittes
Down in sugarland doing the best we can
Falling in love again down in sugarland

Corn fields swaying, clothes on the line
Tumbleweed is a turning like the hands of time
When I was sixteen going on seventeen
I didn't know much of anything
Living the American dream down in sugarland

And I see the small town smile in your eyes
Shining like a diamond in the sky
The sweet sky, under the sweet sky

Sweet skies of sugarland doing the best we can
Holding hands staying up all night
Swinging stars from satelittes down in sugarland
Doing the best we can
Falling in love again down in sugarland

Whoa, whoa, whoa, sugarland
Sweet skies of sugarland, sugarland
(Sugarland) warm breeze blowing
Long dirt road
Sugarland
