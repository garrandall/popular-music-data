I was a little different 
I didn't do what the fast girls do 
study my rhythm 
you can speed me up when you want to, oooh 

They were to cool to run my race 
You kept the pace with a smile on ya face 
Go head baby(go head baby) 
Then I knew he was you(then i knew he was you) 

But first you took me around 
Introduced me to your family and friends 
And told them how that once we met that 
We would never lose 
Oh boy 

I decided that you are the him for me 
Oh boy 
Because..... 
I decided that you are the him for me 
Oh my boy 

How's it feel to win it 
Where ain't no mountains that you can't move 
Your mind is like a prism 
For god's light to shine through 

They were to cool to run my race (Yeah) 
You kept the pace with a smile on ya face 
Go head baby (go head baby) 
Then I knew it was true (Then I knew it was you) 

But first you took me around 
Introduced me to your family and friends 
And told them how that once we met that 
We would never lose (never lose never lose) 
Oh boy 

I decided that you are the him for me 
Oh boy 
Because....... 
I decided (I decided) that you are the him for me (u are the one for me baby) 
Oh my boy (OHH Boy) 

You were running me running me down (down) 
Telling me telling me wait (wait) 
Running me down and telling me you were never gonna let go 
Is the way you got me (ohh thats the way u got me when u got me baby ohh now u got me baby) 

You were running me running me down (running) 
Telling me telling me wait (tellin me tellin me wait) 
Running me down and telling you were never gonna let go 
Is the way you got me 

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
Baby, Dont break my heart 
Whoa..Let me take it from you (let me take it from you) 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby) 
Cause were one and the closer I get 
To you the more fearful I become 
Whoa....That would break me in two Honey (that would break me in two honey) 

Because..... 
I decided that you are the him for me 
Oh my boy 

(Yes) You were running me running me down (running me running me down) 
Telling me telling me wait 
Running me down and telling you were never gonna let go yeah yeah thats the way u you got me baby 
that' the way you got me baby 

You were running me running me down 
Telling me telling me wait 
Running me down and telling you were never gonna let go 
Is the way you got me
