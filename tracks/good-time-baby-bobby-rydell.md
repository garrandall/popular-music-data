(Good time baby yeah)

My chick's dynamite, kicks, kicks every night
Good time baby, let's go crazy
You're such a thrill to kiss
Too much when we twist
Good time baby, I'm gonna stick with you

You're a real cool baby and I don't mean maybe
And when I'm with you everything we do moves me to my soul (hm)
Yeah yeah super-fine make sure you're all mine
Good time baby I love you yes I do, Whoa

Good time baby, let's go crazy, whoa
Good time baby I love you yes I do

You're a real cool baby and I don't mean-a maybe
And when I'm with you everything we do moves me to my soul'yay
Yeah, you're mine, super fine make sure you're all mine
Good time baby, I love you yes I do

Yeah, my chick's dynamite, kicks, kicks every night
Good time baby, I love you yes I do, yeah
Good time, good time baby
I really love you, oh yes I do
You're my dynamite with a kiss and a twist every night

Whoa don't stop don't stop now yeah c'mon keep it in the groove
