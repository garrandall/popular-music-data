Good Time Baby
Bobby Rydell
Words and Music by Bernie Lowe, Kal Mann, and Dave Appell

(peak Billboard position # 11 in 1961)

(Good time baby -yeah)

My chick's dynamite, kicks, kicks every night
Good time baby--- let's go crazy
You're such a thrill to kiss
Too much when we twist
Good time baby, I'm gonna stick with you

You're a real cool baby and I don't mean maybe
And when I'm with you everything we do moves me to my soul (hm)
Yeah yeah super-fine make sure you're all mine
Good time baby I love you yes I do'Whoa

Instrumental-- Good time baby, let's go crazy, whoa-oh
Instrumental-- Good time baby I love you yes I do

You're a real cool baby and I don't mean-a maybe
And when I'm with you everything we do moves me to my soul'yay
Yeah, you're mine, super fine make sure you're all mine
Good time baby, I love you yes I do

Yeah, my chick's dynamite, kicks, kicks every night
Good time baby, I love you yes I do'yeah-oh
Good time, good time baby
I really love you-oh yes I do
You're my dynamite with a kiss and a twist every night
