I'll make you laugh when you're blue
That way I can be close to you
From the start;
I play the part,
While I make you laugh
Someone else fills your heart

That's the way of a clown
That's the way of a clown
It's the part I must play,
That's the way of a clown

I laugh, with tears in my eyes
Like a clown, I wear a disguise
Can't let you know,
I love you so,
You love someone else, so on with the show

That's the way of a clown
That's the way of a clown
It's the part I must play
That's the way of a clown

In my heart I keep praying
That some day you'll come to me
But as I masquerade,
I'm afraid it never can be...
Pity me

That's the way of a clown
That's the way of a clown
It's the part I must play
That's the way of a clown
That's the way of a clown
