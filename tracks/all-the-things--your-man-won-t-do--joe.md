Hey, love
You say you need someone to be there for you
To love you all night long
Hah, it's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here
And I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do


Tell me what kind of man
Would treat his woman so cold?
Treat you like you're nothing
When your worth more than gold
Girl, to me you're like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'd give the world to make you mine
(La-la-la-la-laaa)


I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain
We can do it all night
I'll touch all the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot
Nothing is forbidden when we touch


Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do (Every little thing)
(I'll do them for you)
Ohh, oh
Baby, I wanna do (Yeahh)
All of (All of) the things your man won't do (Every little thing)
(I'll do them for you)
Yeahhh


I'll take you out on a night cruise on a yacht
Just can't loose
'Cause we got a lot to look forward to
One, two, what'cha gonna do?
What good is a diamond nobody can see?
I hear he's got you on lock-down
But I got the master key
(La-la-la-la-laaa)


I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love
Baby, when I start, I just can't stop
I love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden when we touch


Baby, I wanna do (Hell yeah)
All of the things your man won't do (Every little thing)
(I'll do them for you)
Oh, oh
Baby, I wanna do (I wanna do)
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
Yeahhh, oh


And I'll-oh yeah, yeah, yeah-oh yeah
I'll
(La-la-la-la-laaa)


I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love
Baby, when I start I just can't stop
I love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden when we touch


Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do (I'm gonna-I'm gonna-I'm-I'm-I'm)
(I'll do them for you)
Sweet lady (Baby), I wanna do (I wanna do)
All of the things your man won't do (And-oh yeahh-yeah-yeah)
(I'll do them for you)


Oh I got a jones in my bones for you
There ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'll make your body cream with my sex machine
I won't stop until I hear your mother scream


Lady, I wanna do (I wanna do)
All of the things your man won't do (Oh, oh, oh-ah, yeah, yeah)
I'll do them for you
Baby (All the things), I wanna do (Wanna do)
All of the things your man won't do (Yeah, oh, oh)
I'll do them for you (I wanna do it for you, baby)
Sweet lady, I wanna do
All of (All of) the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Sweet lady, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
