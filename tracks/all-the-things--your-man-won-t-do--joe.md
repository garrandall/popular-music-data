Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all


Joell ortiz what they call you crazy
that kid has been nothing but short of awesome lately
His mixtape recieved 4 stars in the u.k
Toured s.o.b's down several tuesdays
Valet it up on hot 9  with kay slay
He on nba live 05 
Cuz ea sponsored the rap battle last year that he won
A flight from l.a headed back to where he from
6 Hours so he copped a little somethin to read son
Source mag page 66 was a regun
He got unsigned hype the reckonightion had begun
Very next monday was double x l's chairmans choice
Recently the p.r prray got to hear his voice
Now he back in xxl this time show and prove
Cuz he writtin hit records and his shows improved
He's the dude you need to worrie about
3 More mixtapes done he fin to put those out
Thats how he laugh at doubt
If i was you i would clear his path
Cuz everything about him says you really wanna feel his wrath
He turned down 3 deals this last month
Labels playing tug a war with his name he who they want
He signin over there "Nope" He signin over here "Nope"
The both of ya'll wrong he grindin over there
In a city near you tryin to strengthen his fan base
Layin down cuts like a band-aid
He know how many dudes this man paid the list is endless
He carry big crates just to get into the club
And when he got into the club he gave out his mixtape
His work ethic is great his drives like t-mac
You let him go share a poster RELAX
He's back give him room to breathe
All those that hated will all soon believe
All those who made it will all soon just leave
Once the fans get a whif of mister ortiz
He spits raw please dont confuse him with these other cats
He's a full workout they 3 jumping jacks
Front to back he's an obstacle to overcome
I mean you know nothings impossible but dont be dumb
He grew up in cooper projects so you know he's slum
The only child homie wild he the only one i ever heard nick named the peoples champ
Under-dog all his life earned his stripes doin things he aint like
Like igniting the fifth all night huggin the strip servin a pregnant bitch hard white
He happy his mom's never sucked a glass pipe
She use to sniff gettin her off that shit was a fight
Why the fuck you think homeboy go hard when he writes
Tryin to make his future bright cuz his past got him tight
His cash might be lite pockets empty kid
But same time next year its mtv cribs
His put his life on it twice on it
To make sure he cant ask ? His crib must gon' have a nice price on it
Chandaliers with the ice on it, Persian rugs with no mice on it
Huge tv screens with classics episodes of miami vice on it
Indoor pool and the floor got a mic on it
Plaques all over the wall with his name engraved nice on it
Man listen his ambition gonna have the game locked like the box in san quentin
Fin to win his race cuz he ran different
In through the no's out through the mouth
Not worryin bout his competition radio clout
Look straight same pace let them nigga's be out
They true colors gonna show later on when they breathin all heavy and they legs is worn
Duke gone from havin an ill buzz in the streets
To yo dont nobody give a fuck when he speak
I know it could happen in a couple of weeks
Lifes a bitch aint it?
But me i love every picture that this kid painted
He's the difference between artists and rappers
Artists draw hits rappers take flicks
Other rappers trey sick man these nigga's aint shit
Everythings basic they should claim the same clique
Thats why everything he give hip hop game sick
Like the syringe in the vein of an aids patient
C'aint spit on this b.k bemis take that
The kid is go sign by the dudes who made rap
Face facts g-rap told mike he got a problem on his hands
Mike is joe's a & r just so y'all understand
Krs responded with one word "damn"
The cyphers complete once he shake rakim hand
He a one man movement
General coronel seargent major private and them youngin's on the front lines shootin
Gun high troopin through this war with his music
And he aint gonna stop till he drop get use to it
He speak english fluent his spanish pequeno
So doin regeaton a slight problemo plus he sound moreno
They aint know he was spanish till he transformed so quick and got his goverment established
but none of this matters if you nice you nice
You could be ethiopian rhymin for rice
You could be hatian tryin to rhyme for your rights
You could be south african writtin rhymes for ice
You could be cuban rhymin to cop you a nice little boulder to make it to us coast over night
It is what it is in this buiss you live
When you die thats when your records sales sky high
He tryin to rep while he alive his heart still beatin
Brain still sumbin his nerves still tweakin
Stomach still growlin cuz what he's eatin
Aint enough bring the twelve gauge out its duck season
give him one reason your carreer is gone
Say his name on a song he'll put yours on a tombstone
Not a pizza either im talkin everybody blacked down cryin to the wrods of a speakin preacher
He's a deep believer and what goes around comes around and whats comin around is dope
And what went around is his name and the strength of his flow
His ill show his radio apperances and more
Some things is maybe's and some things for sure
Some niggas is crazy and some nigga's m.o
some nigga's is lazy and some nigga's just wont stop workin till they get what they deserve ya know
That nigga is joe e double l o r tiz pa' please you one match in the snow
He's like a crib on the sun sittin next to the fireplace with the heat on a million and one
This young man is hot he'll sun tan your block
He gon' keep firing your gun jam alot
Heat rise expect to see this man on the top


Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all
Joell ortiz what they call you crazy
that kid has been nothing but short of awesome lately
