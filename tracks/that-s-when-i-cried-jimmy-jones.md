I was passing by the churchhouse
Just like I always do
Someone was getting married
So I peeped in to see who

Got upon a ladder
To get a better view
And bless my soul, to my surprise
My darling, it was you

That's when I cried
That's when I cried
I saw him take you for his bride
And I broke right down and cried

Now darling I forgive you
But I never will forget
Just why you didn't marry me
You haven't told me yet

I'm feeling low with someone
Who loves somebody else
I thought it over good last night
And I felt sorry for myself

That's when I cried
That's when I cried
I just couldn't keep it no more inside
So I broke right down and cried

What's done is done already
That's all there is to that
You got me so bewildered
Till I don't know where I'm at

I can't believe you're married
Can't get it through my head
And every time it crossed my mind
I wished that I were dead

Today I saw you passing
"Hello," was all I said
And bless my soul, you looked at me
And you turned your pretty head

That's when I cried
That's when I cried
I put my foolish pride aside
And I cried, cried, cried

I cried
I cried
I cried
I cried
