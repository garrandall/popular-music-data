I'm going to Chicago; that's the last place my baby strayed
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
I'm packing up my bags, going to leave this old town right away
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike
Chicago City Limits, that's what the sign on the highway read
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
I'm going to keep moving till I get to that street corner 6th and 3rd
(6th and 3rd, hitch hike baby) Hitch hike, yeah
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby


Hitch hike (Hitch hike) Now hitch-a hike (Hitch hike baby)
It's all right (Hitch hike) Hitch hike Jenny (Hitch hike Susan)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike dance)
Yeah, hitch hike (Hitch hike) Hitch hike Jenny
(Hitch hike baby, hitch hike Susan)
(Hitch hike baby, hitch hike Susan)
(Hitch hike baby, hitch hike baby)


I'm going to St. Louis, but my next stop just might be L.A
(Hitch hike) Now what'd I say? (L.A.)
Got no money in my pocket so I'm going to have to hitch hike all the way
(All the way) Yeah (Hitch hike baby)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Now what'd I say
Come on, hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
Come hitch hike Jenny (Hitch hike Susan)
