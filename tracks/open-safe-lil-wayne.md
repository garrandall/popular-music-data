Turn the music up
Mustard on that beat, hoe

Tattoos on my face, nigga (mm)
Grill shining in your face, nigga (yeah)
Blunt smoke in your face, nigga
Hoes smilin' in my face, nigga
Your hoe smiling in my face, nigga (hello)
She out of line, she out of place, nigga (hello)
Everybody know my face, nigga
All eyes on me, get the mace, nigga
Uh, bad bitch with the face glitter
Snoop Dogg, murder was the case nigga
Yeah, my homie got a open case, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
Uh, looking like an open safe, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
Yeah, if it's beef, we overate, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, it's no debate, nigga
Yeah, that go to base nigga
You niggas starve, we let food go to waste, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
I do the same shit I learned on sex-tapes with her
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked nigga
Hungry, bullets eating off your chest-plate nigga
I hope that they gon' think that I'mma have faith in her (no-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her
When the dick was halfway in her
Damn, you ain't dead yet? I'm amazed, nigga
Guess what? I'm coming back with that gauge, nigga
Not the face, but I feel like Sway, nigga
Got you dizzy, turning over in your grave, nigga
I could shoot this bitch and still drive straight, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, I'm irate, nigga
5'5, stuntin' like I'm 5'8, nigga (what?)
Bumbu out the glass, no chase nigga (bumbu)
Only smoke on gas, no brakes, nigga
No brakes, road rage
My new money gonna die of old age
When they shoot me, don't race, we gon' need our own space
Need a piece of that pie, we gon' need it homemade
I be coming home late, bad bitch, long face
She do every single thing but rub me the wrong way
96 Don P, I have never conflicts
And I never been G, like the patterns on snakes
You could drop a dead body, man, I think I know a place
She gon' suck the prototype then swallow all the proteges, nigga
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
We in this bitch, looking like Miss Oprah's safe, nigga (we're safe)
My homie caught a whole case (whole case)
Celebrating like he got a cold case, nigga (oh!)
Whew, wait nigga
Had to take a smoke break nigga
A smoke break nigga

I stick her hands in the fan blades, nigga
That's what she told me where her man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage nigga
In the morning, brains and the pancakes nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep an ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam blam, skate away nigga
King Push, that mean crime get paid, nigga
These fake cuts bleed through the band-aid nigga
So walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
Skate up on you, blam blam
Okay nigga, I just left Hose nigga, I just left Hose, nigga
Federales on my ass, fuckin' had a boat chase nigga
They didn't see no face nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
If she open her fuckin' mouth, knock all the white out, no racism
That's cold, homies, pump that bass, nigga
And sometimes we close the safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break, niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes, you lowercase nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder-blades nigga
Don't hate, call it ace-to-ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch and a MAC just in case nigga
I'm a Scarface, nigga, fuck your human race, nigga
I'm on base, nigga, yeah Lil Tunechi safe, nigga
Uh, looking like an open safe, nigga
We in this bih looking like an open safe, nigga
Ya, uh, looking like an open safe, nigga
We in this bih looking like an open safe, nigga
Your hoe smiling in my face nigga
She outta line, she out of place, nigga
I hope that they gon' think that I'mma have faith in her (no-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her
