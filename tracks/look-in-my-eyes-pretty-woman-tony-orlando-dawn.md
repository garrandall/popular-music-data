Time is on my side
Though the world keeps gettin' colder
'Cause I've got you girl to ease my troubled mind
Oh oh

I'm a different man
When your head is on my shoulder
I can find the answers in me
That I never thought I'd find

'Cause when you look in my eyes pretty woman
The world is a peaceful place
All I can see when there's you and just me
Is love upon your face

Stand by me baby
And we'll find a way
Before our day is done
Look in my eyes pretty woman
And we'll overcome

Love, my guiding star,
You're my faith, my hope, my power
When I just can't find a reason to believe
Oh Oh

Touch my hand with love
And you light my darkest hour
I can feel the warmth returning
And the pain about to leave

'Cause when you look in my eyes pretty woman
The world is a peaceful place
All I can see when there's you and just me
Is love upon your face

'Cause when you look in my eyes pretty woman
The world is a peaceful place
All I can see when there's you and just me
Is love upon your face
