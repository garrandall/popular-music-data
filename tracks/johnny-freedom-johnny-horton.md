When our country was a baby and the Redcoats had their way
It was he who had a party tossin' tea in Boston Bay
It was he who braved the winter in the days of Valley Forge
Fightin'side by side together with a fella name of George

Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America
Our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
That's our boy

When our country started growin' and the wagons headed West
When our country called for pioneers his name led all the rest
What a figure in his raw hide coat and hat made of raccoon
Wonder what there was about him made you think of Dan'l Boone

Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America
Our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
That's our boy

If we need a mess of thinkin' he's the Lincoln of the day
If we're fixin' for a tussle it's his muscle all the way
If we need a handsome fella so the ladies hearts can throb
There's a Yankee Doodle Dandy always handy for the job

Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America
Our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
That's our, that's our, that's our boy
