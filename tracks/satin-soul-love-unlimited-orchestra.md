Am I a man who knows how to love
When you hate what you fear the most here
I'll wash your feet as you spit in my face
Hey you, I love your soul
I'm gonna love when you hate
You can't outrun or escape this liquid
My life poured out like water here
I'm gonna drown you
With maddening forgiveness
Hey you, I love your soul
I can't depend on your hate
To define my love
Am I strong enough
To love your soul
Love doesn't care to receive what it gives
Bleeding compassion to extreme
Love stretches out to die for its enemies
Hey you, I love your soul
I can't depend on your hate
To define my love
Am I strong enough
To love your soul
No bounds on the deep
No bounds on the wide
Am I deep enough
Yo love your soul
God, I want to swim in the deep of You
God, in You I'm strong enough
Strong enough, strong enough
I can't depend on your hate
To define my love
Am I strong enough
To love your soul
No bounds on the deep
No bounds on the wide
Am I deep enough
To love your soul
