Whoo, whoo! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville.
And I'll meet you at the station.
You can be there by four-thirty,
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.

'Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again.
We'll have one more night together
Til the morning brings my train and I must go.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.

Take that last train...
Take the last train to Clarksville.
I'll be waiting at the station.
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses,
And a bit of conversation, oh,
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

Take the last train to Clarksville,
Now I must hang up the phone,
I can't hear you in this
Noisy railroad station.
All alone, I'm feeling low.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't know if I'm ever coming home.
Hey girl, take the last train!
Bring it on home! Hey girl, hey, bring it on home!

Take the last train to Clarksville,
And I'll meet you at the station.
You can be there by four-thirty,
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow,
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.

Take that last train! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Hey, take that last train! Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Girl, bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville. (Take that last train! And just bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville...
