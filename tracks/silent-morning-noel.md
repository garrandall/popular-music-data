I'm on fire
My emotions run so deep
You vowed to love me
Is that a vow you keep

Your smile's so tender
You'll not be sighing a sweet surrender
Your touch is so pleasing
Makes me warm inside
Makes me feel I'm alive

And I can't resist the heavenly bliss
The magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me beyond the skies

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side
Silent morning, you know how hard I try
Silent morning, they say a man's not supposed to cry
Silent morning, why did your love have to be a lie

I'm on fire
And you're my every desire
A living fantasy
And you know just what to do for me

I love the things you do
Here open arms waiting here for you
Words you whisper
Makes me warm inside
Makes me feel I'm alive

And I can't resist the heavenly bliss
The magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me beyond the skies

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side
Silent morning, you know how hard I try
Silent morning, they say a man's not supposed to cry
Silent morning, why did your love have to be a lie

And I can't resist heavenly bliss
Magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me to paradise

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side
Silent morning, you know how hard I try
Silent morning, they say a man's not supposed to cry
Silent morning, why did your love have to be a lie
