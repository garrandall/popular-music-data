I realized I belong to you
I feel the darkness when I'm away from you
Hey

Don't stop your lovin',
Walk out on me.
Don't stop for nothin'.
You're what I bleed
I learned to love you the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain.
This is not the same

I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, yeah, nothing

I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing

Pick up your phone. I got a question. Oh
If I die tonight would you regret it?

Don't stop your lovin'.
It's all I have
'Cause I can't function.
No, I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain.
This is not the same

I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, oh
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing

When I feel the love, girl, I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of. Oh, yeah
I can't get enough. I'm insane
Without your touch, touch, touch.

I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
Nothing, nothing, nothing without you
