Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go. Are you sure?
Control is not convinced
But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort
The countdown starts

Watching in a trance, the crew is certain
Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us
Drifting, falling, floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Second stage is cut
We're now in orbit
Stabilizers up, running perfect
Starting to collect requested data
"What will it affect, when all is done?"
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control
There is a problem
"Go to rockets full"
Not responding
"Hello Major Tom, are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on
We're standing by"
There's no reply

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us
Drifting, falling, floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Across the stratosphere, a final message
"Give my wife my love"
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning
They don't realize, he's alive
No one understands, but Major Tom sees
Now the light commands
This is my home, I'm coming home"

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Calling home

Home
