I know that He
Gave His life for me
Set all our spirits free
So I wanna do right
Wanna do right
All of my life

I never dreamed
I could be holding you
Well He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right
Wanna do right
I wanna do right

You've got to do right
Yes you've got to do right
And to be your guiding light
But you've got to do right
And to be your guiding light
Listen to the people

I used to say
Love was just a game you play
Now I see it in a different way
So I wanna do right
I got to do right
I've got to do right

I never knew
I could be holding you
But He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right
Want to do right
I want to do right

You've got to do right
Yes you've got to do right
And to be your guiding light
But you've got do right
And to be your guiding light
Listen to the people

Well we just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on living like we're livin'
We just can't keep on pushin to the limit
We just can't keep on
Just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We Just can't keep on (living like we're livin)
We just can't keep on pushin to the limit
Just can't keep on
Just can't keep on
Just can't keep on
Livin' like we're livin'
Just can't keep on
Just can't

Just can't keep livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on
Just can't keep on pushin to the limit
We just can't
Don't you know we got to do right, do right ooh do right
Don't you know do right
And to be you're guiding light, ooh ooh
Yes you've got to do right
And He'll be your guiding light
