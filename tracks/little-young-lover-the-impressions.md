Little young lover
Why don't you like me?
Can't you see honey
You're gonna drive me out of my mind

I can't sleep at night
For thinking about you
You're looking so nice
And you're about to drive me crazy

When we're in school
And you're sitting next to me
I'm acting a fool
Just to get your attention
Can't you see

Little young lover
With pigtails so long
I'll carry your books
If you would only let me walk a you home

A ha-ha
A ha-ha

When we're in school
And you're sitting next to me
I'm acting a fool
Just to get your attention
Can't you see

Little young lover
With pigtails so long
I'll carry your books
If you would only let me walk a you home

Ah-ah young lover
Come to me young lover
I love your brother
