Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up


2 Chainz (Yeah)
I'm a villainous winner
With precision, I'm killing
Represent the religion
Ended up independent
Took my car to the clinic
Let 'em check all the vitals
Middle finger to rivals
Michael Jackson, my idol
Still ducked in a pie hole
Talk to the plug, every day except Cinco de Mayo
I still got me a Carlo
Still got money, Carlo
Your car running so bad, it stink up to your parlor
Call my rollie a Ralo
Call my AP a app
I ain't talking seat-belts when I say that I'm strapped
I'm in love with my side hoe
I sneak up through the side door
I'm a show you what we ride for
I'm a show you what we die for


I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up


I'm in my same lane, lane that ain't gon' ever change up
I blow the brain out the range like a tasandra
Here's R.I.P. to Paul Walker homie, he gotta stand up
We had you main on us, no we got stains on us
And all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (What we gotta do?)
Yeah, I got her Indian and she Western
Yeah, just say so, money your best friend
Then that fast and furious started nesting
Say I'm bout to go take off on you (Take off on you)
Is staying, is you rolling like a scroller? yes you are
Your ready to take off like a 1980 Coke
He know that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that


I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up


Yeah, I'm always with my gang
We always ready to ride 'case for the squad, we'll do anything
Stay down, we'll never change
We always gon' stay the same
Put you in check, when you outta place
I try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang
We do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain
I'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane
Know you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang
I got the world on my back
I put your girl on her back
I did it all on my own
Now there ain't no turning back
And my whole squad got my back
And shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang, she said "Facts"
Gang, gang, gang


I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your hoe, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up
