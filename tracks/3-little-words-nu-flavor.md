One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are, 3 little words that say it all
I love you

Never believed in love at first sight
But I believe what I'm feeling tonight
'Cause when I saw you across the room
I felt my heart going boom, boom, boom

I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked, oh you, oh girl
You know I'm falling for you because


One look in your eyes
I knew we two would alwayz be together
And there are, 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize
That I wanna be with you forever
So say those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you

I was waitin' for a sign from you
Hoping you'd feel the same way, too
When you looked at me and smiled
My heart was goin' a thousand miles

I stopped, turned around, I tried
To keep my feet on the ground
As I stepped to you, we touched
I knew you were feelin' it too because



I know it's written all over my face
And girl you can believe it's true
'Cause time could never erase
These feelings I have for you
