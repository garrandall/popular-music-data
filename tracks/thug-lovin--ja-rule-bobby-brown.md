What up, Gotti, yeah
This is how itâs goinâ down
(All we need is a a stage, God
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, come on, ha-ha-ha)
Itâs on and poppinâ, baby (Itâs on and poppinâ)
The Last Temptation, ha-ha
Heâs back
Yâall know who Iâm talkinâ âbout
To the world over, B. Brown
Come on, come on

I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored

I know youâre livinâ your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss beinâ next to me, donât you
Donât let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere or intervene on me
Peelinâ your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see itâs on me
Shoes 19, cominâ through in that new Bentley thing
Talk of the town, tease of the city...
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and
Whitney
It appears the Lord sent me a pound ??
Real devilish and freak that ***
Forget the story, I know youâre gettinâ bored
And you ainât gettinâ horny no more, is he
âCause when itâs all said and done, itâs me
Lovinâ, thugginâ you

I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored

Sweet thing livinâ it
Wonât you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's had to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent
Maybe Iâm too generous
Generally believinâ that all women want me
They donât wanna get even
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God
Betray your trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
âCause I love it when you rock your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up all the Bacardi
And roll up along side me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat
âCause when itâs said and done youâre gonna want me
Lovinâ, thugginâ you

I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored

Baby, here Iâm holdinâ your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
âCause you been gettinâ at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
âCause I been in a rage lately
Hopinâ Godâll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and itâs just the beginninâ
I hope your *** so you could see that n**** ainât hooked like me
The black sheep of my family
But we one in the same, thatâs why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love lookinâ somethinâ like soft porno
Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him
But the brightest of days just look dim
When you f***inâ with a loser, baby, you canât win
When itâs said and done youâre gonna need me
Lovinâ, thugginâ you

I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
I know you miss my lovinâ, my thugginâ
Thug lovinâ

And I know youâre gettinâ bored

Yeah, yeah, I.G, Ja Rule
B. Brown
Murder Inc.
Def Jam, Sony
This is what we buildinâ here
Murder Inc.

Ha-ha-ha
Bobby Brown
Murder
Ha-ha

Itâs that real
Rule, baby
Bring it back my, n****
B. Brown, ha-ha

And I know youâre gettinâ bored
Dealinâ with him
