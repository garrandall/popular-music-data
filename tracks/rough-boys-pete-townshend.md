Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you

I wanna see what I can find

Tough kids
Take a bottle of wine
When your deal is broken
Ten quid
She's so easy to find
Not a word is spoken
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I feel pretty blissed here
Tough boy
I'm gonna carry you home
You got pretty pissed, dear

Gonna get inside you
Gonna get inside your bitter mind

I wanna see what I can find

Rough boys
Don't walk away
I wanna buy your leather
Make noise
Try and talk me away
We can't be seen together
Tough kids
What can I do?
I'm so pale and weak
Rough fits
In my Hush Puppy shoes
But I'm still pleading
Pleading, bleeding, fining, whining, shining

I wanna see what I can find

Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't you walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you

I wanna see what I can find
