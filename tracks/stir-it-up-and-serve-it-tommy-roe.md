Stir it up and serve it,
Shake it all around,
'Cause everybody's groovin'
To what you're putting down
So stir it up and serve it, (ah-oop)
You're looking so exciting, (ah-oop)
And when you move it closer, (ah-oop)
You make it so inviting (ah-oop, ah-oop)
Now, when I...
Watch you do
The things you do, now,
All right!

Girl,
It makes me hungry for you...
Stir it up and serve it, (ah-oop)
We'll have a celebration (ah-oop)
And everybody's welcome (ah-oop)
Don't need an invitation (ah-oop)
So stir it up and serve it, (ah-oop)
'Cause girl, you're really cookin' (ah-oop)
And I can't wait to hold you (ah-oop)
When there's nobody lookin' (ah-oop, ah-oop)
Yeah, when I...
Watch you do
The things you do, now,
All right!

Girl...,
It makes me hungry for you...
So stir it up and serve it,
Shake it all around,
Everybody's groovin',
To what you're putting down
So Stir up and serve it,
You're looking so exiting,
Stir it up and serve it,
You make it so inviting...
