Found a cure

Ooh, for your heartache
Before you wake, before you wake
Don't take no medicine, take a little of this
It worked for me and it can't miss

Found a cure, oh, try it

It's by far better than any kind of medicine
‘Cause it'll take away the tears
And that ain't all you get
Whatever it is, love will fix it

Found a cure
Found a cure
Found a

Ooh, for loneliness
I promise this, I promise this
For all your hopes and all your empty dreams
Comin' at you is a sure thing

Found a cure, oh, try it

And here's the big surprise
Whenever it rains, you'll have blue skies

Found a cure (I'm tellin' you)
Found a cure (Right away now)

It's by far better than any kind of medicine
‘Cause it'll take away the tears
And that ain't all you get
Whatever it is love could fix it
