If I had one wish boy
I'd wish you next to me
And it could be in summer fall or spring boy
'cause you make my heart sing
I wanna give my heart my soul my love to you
Oh baby oh baby
'cause every day I'm not with you
I'm missing you like crazy
I need for you to...

I need for you to love me hold me touch me
Down deep in my soul never let it go
At the love we share no one compares to you
I'll never let you go 'cause I really love you so
Oh I...
I'll never let you go oh no...

If you must know the truth boy
I'm nothing without you
Its funny how I know
What people mean boy
And it's too good to be true
Because you bring me joy good love
Good times such happiness
Oh baby oh baby
And every day I thank the lord for you
I feel so blessed
I need for you to...

I need for you to love me hold me touch me
Down deep in my soul never let it go
Of the love we share no one compares to you
I'll never let you go 'cause I really love you so
Oh I...
I'll never let you go oh no...

If you only knew
What you really do
Ain't never had no one that does it quite like you
You could spend half a lifetime
Trying to find one like you
That's why I am so glad I found you
I wish a upon a star it came true
Darling I just need for you to...

I need for you to love me hold me touch me
Down deep in my soul never let it go
Of the love we share no one compares to you
I'll never let you go 'cause I really love you so
Oh I...
I'll never let you go oh no..
