I saw her from a distance
Out in the corner of my eye
Her hair is shiny and bright
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen around
I saw her from a distance
She made me wanna smile
Her face is cute and it's beautiful
And she's the only girl that stands out in the crowd

I hope you'll notice me sometime
I hope you be with me, be mine
You're everything, you're my sunshine
(Oh, oh, oh)

Cause I've been struck by lightning, lightning
And it's frightening, frightening
I don't ever think I'll be the same again
You're my princess, my girl
You're my interest, my world
You mean everything, everything to me
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And if you smile at me
You would make my heart start racing
And it's clear to see you're so amazing

Cause I've been struck by lightning, lightning
And it's frightening, frightening
I don't ever think I'll be the same again

Cause I've been struck by lightning, lightning
And it's frightening, frightening
I don't ever think I'll be the same again
You're my princess, my girl
You're my interest, my world
You mean everything, everything to me
