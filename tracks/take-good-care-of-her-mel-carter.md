Take care good care of her
Take care good care of her

I suppose I ought
To say congratulations
For you've won the
Only girl I'll ever love

But I hurt too much
To face the situation
Just take care good care of her
Take care good care of her

Just to be around her
Was my greatest pleasure
She was everything
My future held in store

So remember when you
Take my only treasure
Please take care good care of her
Take care good care of her

I must accept it
She loves more than me
So with my broken heart
I'll bow out gracefully

Please don't send me
Any wedding invitations
For I couldn't bear to
See her there with her

If she's happy
That will be my consolation
So take care good care of her
Take care good care of her

Take care good care of her
Take care good care of her
