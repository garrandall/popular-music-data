Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

Now she tied you to a kitchen chair;
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew "Hallelujah."

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah...

Hallelujah...
