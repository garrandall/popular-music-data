Damn son, this is damn fun
(Grraa) Damn, huh?
Playing that basketball
We playing that a law
Imma just get to the kitchen
Whip it then I flip it, then trap it all
I gotta get to the dolla
All them haters, back 'em off
Smoking on gas a lot
Ready to wack 'em all
Wack 'em all
Wack 'em all (grrraa)
Clap, clap, clap
Clap 'em all
This what I did to the haters
The choppa hit 'em, tell 'em back 'em off
She like Apple Jacks
I like apple sauce
That's a boss, that's the cost
Why you tryna flex
And you fashion off
Chain around my neck
And herâis soft
Smoking on that gas
I ain't passing off
Asthma cough
Fashion law
Stash it off
Dash it off
Flash it off
Don't pass it off
Imma just get to the kitchen
And trap hard hard hard
With all myâ


Did you see my bag? (Where?)
Did you see my bag? (Where?)
It's hella trophies and it's hella thick (Hella thick! Hella thick!)
What you think 'bout that? (Well)
What you think 'bout that? (Well)
I bet it got my haters hella sick (Hella sick!)
Come and follow me follow me
With your signs up
I'm so firin' firin' boy your time's up
Keep on and runnin'
And runnin' until I catch up
How you dare?
How you dare?
How you dare?


Another trophy
My hands carry 'em
Too many that I can't even count 'em
Mic drop, mic drop
ë°ë° ì¡°ì¬ ëë¤ ë§ë§ ì¡°ì¬
Somebody stop me
I'm boutta pop off
Too busy you know my body ain't enough
Mic drop, mic drop

Baby, watch your mouth
It come back around
Once upon a time
We learnt how to fly
Go look at your mirror
Same damn clothes
You know how I feel
ê°íë³µ
(Turn up) How many hours do we fly
I keep on dreamin' on the cloud
Yeah I'm on the mountain
Yeah I'm on the bay
Everyday we vibin'
Mic drop, baam
