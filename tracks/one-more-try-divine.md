I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it is time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say that you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go

Chorus:
'Cuz teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to hold you, touch you
Don't think that you're mine
Because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl whose teacher has told
Her goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at you feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

(chorus)
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try
