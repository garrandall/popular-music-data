Gina, Gina, I kissed you once and then
I felt so wonderful, so very wonderful
Let's do it over again
Gina (Gina), Gina (Gina), I can't remember when
I've ever felt a kiss that made me feel like this
Let's do it over again
Look at you, oh, look at you
So warm, so sweet, so shy
Look at me, oh, look at me
I can't believe that I'm such a lucky guy
To have Gina, Gina all for my very own
It's much too wonderful, so very wonderful
To know that Gina is mine alone
Oh, look at you, oh, look at you
So warm, so sweet, so shy
Look at me, oh, look at me
I can't believe that I'm such a lucky guy
To have Gina (Gina), Gina (Gina) all for my very own
It's much too wonderful, so very wonderful
To know that Gina is mine (Gina is mine)
Gina is mine alone
