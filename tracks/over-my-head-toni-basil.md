You better look out cause
Suspicious eyes are watching
Don't let them see us

I know that you and I
Should not be seen here talking
I kinda like the razor's edge

I always
You like to walk a tight rope
I work my show without a net
It never fails, I dive
Into the deepest ocean
Not knowing if I'll sink or swim

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh

We're always meeting in the dark
It's hard to see you
I'll feel my way
I'll take a chance

Risking exposure
Every time I come to meet you
I'm lady luck again

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh

I got a feeling
This time I can't take it
You'll play it again
In a place for real

Although I'm falling
So fast already
I'm deeper than I should be
I'm over my head

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh

Oh, oh, I'm over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
I'm over my head

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh...
