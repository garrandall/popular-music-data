There's a boy a little boy
Shooting arrows in the blue
And he's aiming them at someone
But the question is at who
Is it me or is it you
It's hard to tell until you're hit
But you know it when they hit you
Cause they hurt a little bit

Here they come pouring out of the blue
Little arrows for me and for you
You're fall in in love again
Falling in love again

Little arrows in your clothing
Little arrows in your hair
When you're in love you'll find
Those little arrows everywhere
Little arrows that will hit you once
And hit you once again
Little arrows that hit everybody
Every now and then

Oh oh oh the pain

Some folks run and others hide
But there is nothing they can do
And some folks put on armor
But the arrows go straight through
So you see there's no escape
So why not face it and admit
That you love those little arrows
When they hurt a little bit

Here they come pouring out of the blue
Little arrows for me and for you
You're fall in love again
Falling in love again

Little arrows in your clothing
Little arrows in your hair
When you're in love you'll find
Those little arrows everywhere
Little arrows that will hit you once
And hit you once again
Little arrows that hit everybody
Every now and then

Little arrows in your clothing
Little arrows in your hair
When you're in love you'll find
Those little arrows everywhere
Little arrows that will hit you once
And hit you once again
Little arrows that hit everybody
Every now and then...
