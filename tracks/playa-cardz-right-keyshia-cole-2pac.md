Wassup, boo? Yeah
Hahahaha, yeah

 
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right


I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who Be The One Who Be There 
Through The Thick And Thin 
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

 
No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be OK
If We Try And Take Our Time 
Yes, baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whoâ¦


I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more


You got to play your cards right on one (Oh, yeah)
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (No, no, no)
If you be patient, and you take your time (Be patient, baby)
And you finesse it, 9 times out of 10 times (10)
Homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'
Ha-ha (Hey, it takes a real man)
Your ass is going home tonight, ha-ha (Hey)
Play your cards right, nigga, take your time (Be the one)
Be patient (Be the one, hey)
Go slow, it's better that way, you ain't heard? (Yeah)
Ha-ha, play your cards right (Be the one, I wanna be the one)


I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more


Take your time, man (Take your time)
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush)
Ha-ha (Be forever more)
You got to be patient, man, be patient
It ain't going nowhere one, ha-ha (Nowhere)
Get some champagne (Ha-ha, be forever more)
Bring some roses or somethin', you know
Play some soft shit, light a fire (Luther Vandross)
You got to be cool with it (Teddy, Teddy)
You got to be slow with it (Oh, be so)
You got to be patient, you got to play your cards right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'?
If you be patient, and you take you time and you finesse it
