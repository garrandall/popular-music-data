What's up boo?
Yeah, ha ha ha ha
Yeah

Another shady mission, tricks
Like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy yesterday with stolen kisses

Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the death that they planned for me
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go

No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'

Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain
The world's crazy, still lookin' for a queen
To plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious
If you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on
Who, who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we will be there to the mornin'
We won't leave until the night and we will be forever more

No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside
And it's gonna be alright, it'll be okay

If we try and take our time
Please baby, take your time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one who

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on
Who, who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we will be there to the mornin'
We won't leave until the night and we will be forever more

You gots to play your cards right on one
Can't be rushin' like it's a race, know what I'm sayin'?
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it

9 times out of 10 homeboy
You gon' wake up wit ya breakfast in bed
But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'
Your *** goin' home tonight, ha ha

Play your cards right nigga, take your time
Be patient, go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard? Ha ha, playa cards right

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on
Who, who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we will be there to the mornin'
We won't leave until the night and we will be forever more

Take your time, man
(Take your time)
Don't be in such a rush
(In a rush)
You got to be patient man
(Oh, be so)
Be patient

It ain't goin' nowhere one
(Nowhere)
Get some champagne
Bring some roses or somethin', ya know?
(Be forever!)

Play some soft sh**
Light a fire
(Luther Vandross)
You gotta be cool wit it
(Teddy, Teddy)
You gotta be slow wit it
(Oh, be so)
Got to be patient

You gotta playa cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
(Nowhere)
If you be patient and take your time
(Be forever)
And you finesse it

Yeah, I tell him to take it slow
Everybody's movin' so fast these days
Shoulda listened to every word you said

Ain't gonna lie because you beautiful
But it's another reason why they wanna hurt you
But you know, rest in peace brah
