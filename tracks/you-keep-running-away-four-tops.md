You keep running away
You come back to me
But still you won't stay
Darlin you keep running away
Tear my heart apart every step of the way
You're here today and gone tomorrow
Leave this heart of mine in sorrow
Then you come around every now and then
Long enough to hurt me then you're gone again
Darlin you keep running away
Well I begged you not to leave but you never stay
Now you, you keep running away
Leavin me here to face another lonely day
To you all of this is just a game
Well each time you leave I feel the pain
But I've got so much love for you
I keep wanting you no matter what you do
All I want to do is take care of you
Everything I have in my life
I will share with you
This soul of mine has been processed by you
Darling my heart has been obsessed with you
Just look at me
I'm not the man I used to be
I used to be proud
I used to be strong
But all of that's changed girl
Since you come along
Your lovin sweetness
Is my weakness
Boy I need you dear
I just can't keep you near
Each time you go the hurt comes callin
My days become nights, darlin
My nights become so much longer
You're in my life, you're in my heart
But I can't get you
Get you into my arms
Darlin, you keep runnin away
