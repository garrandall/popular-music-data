Back when my hair was short
I was a white sock sport
Wore pointed shoes and pegged pants
Drank 'til my eyes were red
Hid "Playboy" 'neath my bed
Slicked my d.a. for the dance (When you dance, when you dance)

Back when my hair was short
I met some friends in court
For stealing hubcaps from cars
Chain smoking under the stars
Played all night pinball in bars

And dreamed about love (Love)
We were experts on love
We talked our way all around it
And even if we had found it
We couldn't respond

Slowly I changed my ways
College and long-haired days
Seeing three concerts a week
An honest-to-God hippie freak
Too busy eating to speak

Except about love (Love)
We held rallies for love
But no one knew what they stood for
How many months were they good for?
The meaning is gone

Soon when my hair is short
I'll make a full report
Of how I came back alive (Came back, came back alive)
And what it takes to survive
Wringing the truth out of jive

I'll tell you of love (Love)
More than ever it's love
No lack of faith undermines it
'Cause it's the hope that we'll find it
That makes us go on

Back when my hair was short
I was a white sock sport
Holding beer parties 'til three
College appealed to me
Eastern philosophy
