I'm the one who cares about you
I'm the one who'll always be true

'Cause I know, yes I know-oh-oh
That I, I love you so

I'm the one who'll be by your side
I'm the one with arms open wide

'Cause I know, yes I know-oh-oh
That I, I love you so

You're the reason I'm livin'
Please don't break my heart in two
'Cause the love that I am givin'
Will always be with you

I'm the one who needs your tender touch
I'm the one who needs your love so much

'Cause I know, yes I know-oh-oh
That I, I love you so

You're the reason I'm livin'
Please don't break my heart in two
'Cause the love that I am givin'
Will always be with you

I'm the one who needs your tender touch
I'm the one who needs your love so much

And so, so I know-oh-oh
That I, I love you so
