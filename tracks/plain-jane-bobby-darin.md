My plain Jane never wear
A-no lipstick or paint
You know she'll never try
To be what she ain't

Come early in the mornin'
You can hear the fellas call... woo
Well, plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
So we can have a ball

Help me now...

Plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
An' spend some time with me

Her mouth's a little too wide
And her nose a wee bit long
And when you take a good look at her
Her shape seems all wrong

But, she got this certain somethin'
That's so hard to define
And I wish that certain somethin'
Was mine, all mine, all mine... woo

Well, now... plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
A-plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
Spend some time with me

Ooh, wee
Oh, yeah

I used to go with glamour girls
Who wore silks day and night
But plain Jane's gotta cotton dress
And it don't fit her right

I could never, never tell you
Why I love her like I do
But if you took her out for one fine night
You'd feel the same way too

Won't-cha now...

Plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Plain Jane won't-cha come out tonight
An' spend some time with me

I said... spend the time with me
Woo... plain Jane
I love her just the same
Oh... plain Jane
