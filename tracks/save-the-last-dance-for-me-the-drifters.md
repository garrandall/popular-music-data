If I dance every dance with the guy who gives me the eye, let him hold me tight
If I smile every smile for the man who holds my hand 'neath the pale moonlight
I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine, like sparklin' wine, and I'll have some fun
I'll laugh and sing, but while we're apart, I won't give my heart to anyone
And I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so; can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, ever let you go; I love you oh, so much

If I dance, and I carry on 'til the night is gone, and it's time to go
And if he asks if I'm all alone, can he take me home, I will tell him no
'Cause I won't forget who's taking me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

And I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Mmm, darlin', save the last dance for me
And oh, no, no, no, darlin', save the last dance for me
