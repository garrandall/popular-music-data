Now, listen, all you birds
I'm an eagle
When I say hop, let's go

It started one night
At a bird bandstand
Crickets was a jumping
With a swinging band

Had a new dance called
The rock and roll
Illuminated all
But three I'm told

Well, the bluebird
The buzzard and the oriole

Well, it was hopping
Trees was rocking
It was a rocking and
A hopping till the
Leaves came tumbling down

Well, the eagle came
Hopping from tree to tree
Said, I'll emcee this jamboree
All you little sparrows
Better swing and sway
We're gonna rock this tree
Till the break of day

With the bluebird
The buzzard and the oriole

Well, it was rocking
Trees was hopping
It was a rocking and
A hopping till the
Leaves came tumbling down

Well, the blackbird
Blabbing all the news around
The bugs came hopping
From out of the ground

They all joined in
Said, bless my soul
Who started this rock and roll
Well, the bluebird
The buzzard and the oriole

Well, it was hopping
Trees was rocking
It was a rocking and
A rolling till the
Leaves came tumbling down

Well, it was rocking
Trees was hopping
It was a rocking and
A strolling till the
Leaves came tumbling down
