Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I'll feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just won't go
Thursday goes too slow
I have Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight to me

I'll spend my bread
I'll lose my head
I've got to get tonight
Monday, I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day grind once more
No one, nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich man
Hey, I'll change that scene one day

Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight to me

I'll spend my bread
I'll lose my head
I've got to get tonight
Monday, I have Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
Gonna have fun in the city
