Ha ha ha
Call me when yo nigga aint around
Ha ha ha
I don't mind being the dude on the side
You dig!
Ha ha ha ha


Turn around
Let me lick you from yo neck down to yo navel
Cause shawty you look ready
Forget the bed
I wanna lay your body right here on the table
So just hold it steady


I'll go get the camera
We can make a movie
I'm gonna put my hands up
Lay back while you do me
Jump right out the shower
Into the jacuzzi
Giving you what your body wants


I'm boyfriend number 2
Cause the first one he don't really
Seem like he know what to do
I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky
So am gonna give it to you
I'm boyfriend number 2
Baby don't fuss
Don't fight
Don't argue
Cause 2nd place has always got a whole lot to prove
So whenever you get in the mood
(just call me)
I'm boyfriend number 2


Grab my hand
Ima pick you up and put you on the counter
Girl you feel so sexy
I'm not yo other man
Ima take my time and kiss all around ya
Only if you let me


I'll go get the camera
We can make a movie
I'm gonna put my hands up
Lay back while you do me
Jump right out the shower
Into the jacuzzi
Giving you what your body wants


I'm boyfriend number 2
Cause the first one he don't really
Seem like he know what to do
I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky
So I'm gonna give it to you
I'm boyfriend number 2
Baby don't fuss
Don't fight
Don't argue
Cause 2nd place has always got a whole lot to prove
So whenever you get in the mood
(just call me)
I'm boyfriend number 2


Baby if you got a man
And a buddy on the side
Say yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah ee
If you be making plans
Cause he don't hit it right
Say yeah

I'm sure he don't know about
No familiar faces
You can feel free to go all out
I'm not afraid of doing what he dosen't do
