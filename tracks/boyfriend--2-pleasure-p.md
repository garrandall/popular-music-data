Call me when your man ain't around
I don't mind being the dude on the side ya dig


Turn around let me lick you from your neck down to your navel
Cause shawty you look ready
Forget the bed I wanna lay your body right here on the table
So just hold it steady


I'll go get the camera we can make a movie
I'mma gonna put my hands up lay back while you do me
Jump right out the shower into the jacuzzi
Giving you what your body wants


I'm boyfriend number 2
Cause the first one he don't really seem like he know what to do
I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky so I'm gonna give it to you
I'm boyfriend number 2
Don't fuss don't fight don't argue
Cause second place always got a whole lot to prove
So whenever you get in the mood
Just call boyfriend number 2


Grab my hand I'mma pick you up and put you on the counter
Girl you feel so sexy
I'm not your other man I'm a take my time and kiss all around ya
Only if you let me


I'll go get the camera we can make a movie
I'mma gonna put my hands up lay back while you do me
Jump right out the shower into the jacuzzi
Giving you what your body wants


I'm boyfriend number 2
Cause the first one he don't really seem like he know what to do
I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky so I'm gonna give it to you
I'm boyfriend number 2

Ladies if you got a man
And a buddy on the side say yeah say yeah yeah
If you be making plans
Cause he don't hit it right say yeah yeah

I got a couple places I'm sure he don't know about
No familiar faces you could feel free to go out
I'm not afraid of doing what he doesn't do


I'm boyfriend number 2

I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky so I'm gonna give it to you
