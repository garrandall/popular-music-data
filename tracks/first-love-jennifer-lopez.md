Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


See I know a little bit something good
Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new 'til you came down
Giving me the best that I've had


And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round


Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I


Mistakes, I don't worry 'bout them no more
It ain't nothing, 'cause you got me up on Cloud 9
So good, knowing I could just keep it real, t-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly


And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round


Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I


Oh, oh
Oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)


You made me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name, 'cause I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I, I, I, I, I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I
I wanna hear you say my name, 'cause I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I, I, I, I, I
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause if you were my first, baby (My first love)
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (I wish you were)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (I wish you were my first love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I
