Uh, yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee


It's ladies night, what
It must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar, got the spice
Roll the L's tight, keep the rhymes right
Yo, I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and Kim is gettin' cream, like Thelma and Louise, but on chrome
Never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on, then it's on


Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a French kiss
I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ow
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lyin'
Niggas trying to knock me off, keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eight-fitay
Y'all missin' the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West, the Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me


Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)


Uhh, never the one, packin' a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that, lay dat ass flat
I be the one chokin' ya paragraphs, with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin' me ladies from club hoppin' gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin' with the glass in my left one
Right-hand sayin' step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin' that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin'
To the top and it don't stop


Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)


Y'all see, how these bogus niggas
Try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin' with good intentions
But focusin' on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin' of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle 'em like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger clip
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin' up dust
And you can spread rumors
Shit is makin' me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin' me sayin' you lovin' me
Bet ya phony niggas be buggin', I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the Windy City woman still still comin' and gunnin'
Straight from the Chi?
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high


Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)


Ayo Kim, heh heh, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't even gon' leave without sayin' sun'un on this track
You ain't gonna use me to just be singin' hooks
What I look like?
Patti LaBelle or somebody, nigga? Heh heh
Check it out, uh huh, yeah


Oh what a night
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin' bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite
I gotta catch a flight, uh heh heh, around three and shit
Niggas can't see us from Elektra to Undeas
Ow, niggas wanna be us
Heh, I'm out hehe


Ladies night
Ladies night
Ladies night
Ladies night
