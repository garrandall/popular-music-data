Oh I'm on my way, I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair

Sitting on my own not by myself
Everybody's here with me
I don't need to touch your face to know
And I don't need to use my eyes to see

I keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I always wake up the same (or so)?
And keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I even wake up again or something

Oh I'm on my way I know I am
But times there were when I thought not
Bleeding half my soul in bad company
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop

I'm not making love to anyone's wishes
Only for that light I see
'Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me

And if I make it to the waterside
Will I even find me a boat (or so)?
And if I make it to the waterside
I'll be sure to write you note or something

Oh I'm on my way I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair

Oh life is like a maze of doors and they all
Open from the side you're on
Just keep on pushing hard boy, try as you may
You're going to wind up where you started from
You're going to wind up where you started from
