Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car.

Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while.

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look.

Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while.

(Yeeeaaahhhh)

You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound.

A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme.

It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while.

It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while.

(Whoooo)...
