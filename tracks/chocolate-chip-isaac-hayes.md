(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
(Master grip, master grip)
I'm mean, I'm green
I'm a walking sex machine
I'm a sexy player in the street

I gotta find my way back
To a proper space and time
(You ain't never gonna find it, ain't never gonna find it)
Whatever
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
Aww, no baby
What's the game?
(Master grip, master grip)

A pizza that rhymes
They put it in my side
I've got a diamond
That's fit for a king

I can sing, I can dance
I can talk about romance
(You can never have a treasure like you)
What's the game?
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
Yeah

What's the game, y'all?
(Master grip, master grip)
Ah...

I'm fast, I'm blessed
I ain't no dirty man
If there's a room for my color TV
You better get me down
With my blessed up latest sound
(You ain't never had a treasure like this)
Watch my back
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)

What's the game, y'all?
(Master grip, master grip)
Ah...

I got a strong reputation
All across the nation
And even all across the sea
I got a master for the races
She comes from a lot of places
(You ain't never had a treasure like this)

What's the game?
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
Ah...

What's the game, y'all?
(Master grip, master grip)
Ah...

I'm a lover for hire
I set myself on fire
And chill you like it's 32 degree
I'm a brother, I'm a dime
I will really break you mind
(You ain't never had a treasure like this)

What's my name?
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
Ah...
What's the game, y'all?
(Chocolate chip, chocolate chip)
Ah...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
