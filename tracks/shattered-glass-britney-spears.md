Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh

Did I wake you?
Were you sleeping?
Were you still in the bed?

Or is a nightmare keeping you up instead?
Oh baby, are you feeling guilty for what you did?
If you think you're hurting, you ain't seen nothing yet


Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were lookin for?
Feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass


You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

Are you having trouble focusing throughout the day?
Do you find yourself still callin' my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realize that she ain't half the woman I am





Glass (gl-gl-gl), glass (glee-glee-glee), glass, glass

Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
