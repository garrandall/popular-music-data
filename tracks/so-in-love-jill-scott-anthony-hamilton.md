Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Iâm glad this week is over,
I need to get away,
Go home and throw my clothes on,
Come get you right away!
Canât wait to see you looking lovely,
I hope youâre thinking of me,
Cause all I want is time with you
And don't need nothing more!

So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So! So in love with you,
So in love with you!
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you!

I see you cross the room,
Talking with some men,
I love your mannerisms, babe,
The way you handle them
Oh, Iâm so proud to be with you
So attracted to you too,
Youâre so damn good to me,
In everything you do

Cause Iâm so in love with you,
So in love with you,
So! So in love with you,
So in love with you!
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you!

Listen, Iâm so in love with you,
That I canât help myself!
Canât help it!
As long as it's me and you
We donât need nothing else!
Iâve got you!
Got you!
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah,
Oh, Let's make it last forever!

Iâm so in love, uhuu
First ting in the morning
When I open my eyes and see you
Hey, hey, I feel like a breath of fresh air
I feel like I can fly,
That I can get by.

So in love with you,
So in love with you,
Any obstacle that come my way,
Iâll do anything for you!
So in love with you,
So in love with you!
Iâll do anything for you!
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
I feel that I can fly,
So in love with you,
So in love with you!
That I can get bye!
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
Any obstacle that come my way,
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you!

Oh, baby Iâll do anything for you!
Iâll do anything for you,
Iâll do anything!
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you,
So in love with you!

Anytime is all right,
If you want me
Youâre so good to me!
Anytime is all right,
You want me baby, Iâm bad!
Iâll do anything for you!
