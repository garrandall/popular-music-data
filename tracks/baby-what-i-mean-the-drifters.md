Yeah, baby, you know
That I mean what I say
Say what I mean, what I mean

Baby, I'm in love with you
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'll do, I'll do, yeah

Yeah, baby, you know
That I mean what I say
Say what I mean, what I mean

Baby, I don't play around
With any other girl in town
Oh, never let you down
Oh, no, baby, no

Sure I might leave you or
Even deceive you, it's possible
Lightning might strike me
A cobra might bite me, it's possible

Yeah, baby, you know
That I mean what I say
Say what I mean, what I mean

Baby, it will always be
Me for you and you for me
Right on through eternity
It will be, it will be

Yeah, baby, you know
That I mean what I say
Say what I mean, what I mean

Baby, it will always be
Me for you and you for me
Right on through eternity
It will be, it will be

Baby, what I mean
What I mean, yeah...
