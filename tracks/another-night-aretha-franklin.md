All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered.
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters.
I made my mind up
I can make it
I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it.
I'll keep surviving.

Another night - without you.
Another night - I know I can get through.
Another night - it's only
another night - I won't be lonely.
Another night - another night
Another night - it ain't much
Another night - without your touch.

I used to search through the crowd to find you

But I don't feel like it now
So don't look behind you.
You better face it
I won't be calling

I hit my stride when the evening is falling

I'm gonna make it

Another night - without you...

Out where the music is loud and the people are laughing

I'm gonna step on out
I won't be down

Gonna stand my ground for just another night
Oh yes for a another night.

I made my mind up
I can make it

I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it.
I'll keep surviving
Yes
I will.

Another night - without you.
Another night - I know I can get through.
Another night - it ain't much
I don't need you to be bringing me down
