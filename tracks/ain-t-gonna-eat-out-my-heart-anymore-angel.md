Yeahhhhh
I admit you've got the biggest brown eyes
And you know how to part your lips to tantalize
Yeahhhh
And you can get any man you want to know
And you do it, and don't say you don't, 'cause you do
Well baby...

Chorus:
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it!

I love ya, I love ya, I do girl
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you , I really do
Choose, is it him or me (is it him or me)?
Well baby

Chorus:
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
So quit it

Solo

I love ya, I love ya, I do girl
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you, I do girl
Choose, is it him or me (is it him or me)?
Well baby...

Chorus:
I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
(repeat and fade)
