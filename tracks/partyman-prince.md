"Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds!
Lawrence..."

(oh, yeah)

All hail - the new king in town
Young and old, gather 'round (yeah)
Black and white, red and green (funky)
The funkiest man U've ever seen

Tell U what his name is
Partyman, partyman
Rock a party like nobody can
Rules and regulations - no place in his nation
Partyman, partyman

Party people - say it now: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
Somebody holler if U wanna party

"Ladies and gentlemen, no pictures, please!"

Get it up, oh yeah
Partyman, partyman
Get it up, get it up

"Ooh, I love purple"

I rock the party, I rock the house
I rock the whole world, north, east and south
In the west - 17 horns blowin'

Partyman, partyman
(Lose me now boy)
Get it up
All hail the new king in town

Ain't nothin' but a muffin
We gotta lotta butter 2 go
(Y'say aye, an' I like ya 'way, but don't come now)
And if it break when it bend
U better not put it in - uh

Giddy up
(Ride 'em boy)
Partyman, partyman
Partyman
Partyman, partyman

Young and old, gather 'round
Everybody hail the new king in town
