Hey!
Mr.wipe down in dis biatch down ya heard me Foxx-a-million
This one be the reeemix!
Badazz, Savage life, Foxx-a-million
Man you already know what it is ya heard me
We still on, we still ridin on chrome, we still pullin up

I pull up at the club VIP gas tank on E but all drinks on me (wipe me down)
Fresh kicks fresh white tall tee fresh NFL hat fresh bauds wit the crease (wipe me down)
Pussy niggas wanna hit me wit they heat, real recognize real real niggas gon speak (wipe me down)
Jiggalatin I been rollin bout a week you can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth (wipe me down)
Black shades so you know a nigga rollin they ain't check me at the door so ain't no tellin what I'm holdin (wipe me down)
Bad bitches they gon bust it wide open niggas flashin they lil bread but I'm the nigga they approachin (wipe me down)
Small niggas tall figures yall niggas crowd niggas we gon get mac elevens and maul niggas (wipe me down)
Yall niggas call niggas but my niggas all killas get ya issue and whoever fall wit ya

Cuz I'm on (wipe me down)
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

B.O.O.S.I.E.B.A.D.A.Z.Z. that's me (wipe me down)

Red bones caramel all of em stop and stare all of em try and steal my underwear (wipe me down)
I like to floss like Rick Ross got a hit called set it off when I sing it everybody set it off (wipe me down)
Black mink damn I'm on play wit me I bust ya dome 8 whips on chrome you can gon (wipe me down)
Fresh fade fresh j's on the corner playin spades I'm an ordinary person but I'm paid (wipe me down)
Foxx flippin Webbie smokin and we chokin on a whole pound of purple famous lik tha ninja turtles (wipe me down)
Just left New York City hooked up wit P. Diddy finna blow past 50 you gon have (wipe me down)
We the best I'm a fool I'm the hemi man red light green light yellow light get it man

Hot drop drop top top drop hoes drop it like its hot yea nigga I'm the shit (wipe me down)
You see this ice on my wrist how it glist soon as the light hit you can't lie the ice sick (wipe me down)
Purple got me smellin funky red monkey 500 dollars on em you ain't seen these yet (wipe me down)
Beatin you can hear me way around the corner paint wet wit the 24's on em that's bet (wipe me down)
Ol lady's baby momma's few fiance's niggas wife savage life who I'm gonna fuck next (wipe me down)
And I use the life style or the magnum or the trojan or go head and use the barrel of the tech (wipe me down)
Man this chain hit me for a couple grand oh no I ain't complainin just watch how you wipe my chest (wipe me down)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil longer I put that dick up on her but I had a flight to catch (wipe me down)
