If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Do you like the things that life is showing you?

Do you know?


Me and my best friend, 7-Eleven (yeah)

We can go legend, codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend, we go legend, yeah


In my house, yeah
Hear alarms, ringin' through my house (through my house)
Got 'em goin', climbing in and out (in and out)
What you knowin'? Never run your mouth (never run your mouth)


Look, bitch, this not a drill, this the real thing (whoa)
I do what the fuck I feel, fuck your feelings, yeah
Made my blueprints, so my life got no ceilings (I don't see 'em)
I create the energy that they keep stealing, yeah
Detroit legend (whoa) microphone legend, yeah
Sean a legend, my bro is John Legend, yeah (whoa, whoa)
All this sunshine, it's still raining blessings (whoa)
Skrrt out that Maybach, I'm dressed fresher than my reverend, yeah
Oh my God, oh my God, you cockblocked
Bitch, I sock you out yo' socks (bitch)
Me and all my inner circle, we keep thinkin' out the box
Dawg, when life go too hard on you, you gon' go legend or not?
Me, I got no other op- (got no other op')
-tion, I go so hard I might wake up with a concussion (I go hard)
The way I piece this shit together, man, it's puzzlin' (I go hard)
I do this for the dogs and nowadays, we husky
God as my witness, you lil' bitches, you can't judge me


Me and my best friend (oh God) 7-Eleven (yeah) (no, no)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (alright)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend (whoa) 7-Eleven, yeah (whoa)

With my best friend (alright)
7-Eleven (whoa) we go legend (yeah)
We can go legend, codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend, we go legend, yeah


I go legend, I mean, Michael Jackson, hol' up
Prince in action, okay, I'm an original, you just a re-enactment
Okay, peace sign and flashes
I live that picture perfect life you lie 'bout in your captions (mm, mm, mm)
When I was down, I swear they made me feel inferior (straight up)
Judgin' me by my outside, that's just my exterior (straight up)
Not seeing what I was made of, that's my interior (real shit)
Didn't let that shit break me, instead, I broke the barriers
So fuck all y'all, praise Allah
It's my perog' like Bobby, bruh, massages by Nautia
In my castle like Mario, I give this shit my heart and soul
You boys got no cardio, all of my soldiers rock army clothes
'Head of my time like Marty though
Watchin' the Rick and Morty show, while I smoke
All these bands, still fuck her on the floor
Came from the dirt, all I had to do was grow
Remember when my shit got repossessed (damn)
Mm, that shit had us workin' like we possessed (goddamn)


Me and my best friend, 7-Eleven (yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (alright)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend, 7-Eleven, yeah
We go legend (go), we go legend (go), yeah (yeah)
We go legend (go), we go legend (go legend)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend (alright)
7-Eleven (whoa) we go legend, (yeah)
We go legend, codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend, we go legend, yeah
