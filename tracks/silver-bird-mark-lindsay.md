Silver Bird
Mark Lindsay
Get aboard the silver bird, departing gate 19
Satisfy your Walter Mitty mind, tryin' out a dream
Your sign is capricorn and every corner of your mind
Says you'll remain my friend, my friend until your mine
Silver bird, fly my lady away
Silver bird, take her over the bay
Silver bird, give my lady a ride
And let her go see what's on the other side
Silver bird, fly my lady away
Pretty bird, today is the day
Lone rangers and strangers will knock at her door
But I know my babys' no baby no more
Silver bird, fly my lady away
Pretty bird, today is the day
When you come home my crazy heart will greet those silver wings
Your pet dog will remember you, and I'll carry your things
We'll catch a runnin' make-up, and you will look just fine
And you'll remain my friend, my friend until you're mine
Silver bird, fly my lady away
Silver bird, take her over the bay
Silver bird, give my lady a ride
And let her go see what's on the other side
Silver bird, fly my lady away
Pretty bird, today is the day
