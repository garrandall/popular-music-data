Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
My over there was passing me
She got a whole lot of rhythm when she walk
& I can hear rhythm when she talk
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Forget about the do-re & think about me

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
I wonder, who can this creature be?
She ain't Mona Lisa as I can see
But I don't care, she looks good to me
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Forget about the do-re & think about me

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
I can learn to love you, yes sir-ee
I may sound crazy, but it's so fine
Tell me pretty baby you're goin' high
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Forget about the do-re & think about me

(instrumental)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Let's get together & make whoopee
A-b-c-d-e-f-g
Cupid shootin' arrows 3 by 3
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Forget about the do-re & think about me

(repeat & fade):
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Forget about the do-re & think about me
A-b-c-d-e-f-g
Forget about the do-re & think about me
