Dave (Yeah?)
I got a little song I wanna sing (Yeah!)
Eddie Floyd wrote the song for us
(Oh, yes he did, brother)
And I believe I could tell the world about it (Yeah!)
He told me to tell 'em about my baby (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
Oh baby, and I got to sing the song
(When all brothers'll listen to it)
This is what Eddie told me to tell 'em
(Go 'head and tell 'em 'bout it, son)


Baby, don't you worry about your man
I be comin' home as soon as I can
I got a love in the palm of my hand
Got to get back to you just as soon as I can


You don't know, oh, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, no, no, you don't know
He also tell me to tell all the brothers this here
He said, look...


I've got lovin' you on my mind
I'm startin' right now, so I will be on time
I wanna do all that I can (Ah yeah)
Just to prove to you that I'm a livin' soul man


You don't know, no, what you mean to me
You don't know, yeah, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, no, no, you don't know
Now wait a minute
We got something else we'd like to say right here, ow


I'm gonna love you
'Cause that's the way I planned it, yeah
(Tell 'em this, Dave)
I'm gonna kiss you (Yes, I am)
That's the way I planned it (Look)
I'm gonna hold you 'til you can't stand it
'Cause that's the way I planned it (Yes I did)
(Tell 'em, son)
Oh, I'm gonna love you (Love you), love you (Love you)
Love you just as hard as I can
And oh (Oh), and oh (Oh), and oh (Oh)


You don't know, no, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, no, no, you don't know


And oh (Oh), and oh (Oh), and oh (Haha)
You don't know (You don't know)
You don't know (You don't know)
Said you don't know (Nobody)
That you could hold on
(You know, Eddie told me this, Dave)
You don't know
(He said tell 'em)
I'm a soul man
(They don't know)
I'm on my way
(Somebody)
Put your hand in mine
(Listen to me)
You don't know
(You) Just don't know
(Please let me tell you)
Oh (Oh), somebody help me
(You don't know)
