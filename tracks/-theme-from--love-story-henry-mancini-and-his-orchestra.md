Where do I begin
To tell the story
Of how great a love can be
The sweet love story
That is older than the sea
That simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first h***o
She gave a meaning
To this empty world of mine
That'd never be
Another love another time
She came into my life
And made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart
With very special things
With angel songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love
That anywhere I go
I'm never lonely
With her along who could be lonely
I reach for her hand
It's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now
But this much I can say
I know I'll need her till this love song burn away
And she'll be there...
How long does it last
Can love b measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers no
But this much I can say
I know I'll need her till this love song burn away
And she'll be there...
