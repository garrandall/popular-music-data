What makes me feel so good
I got your lovin every day
Just like you know you should
You keep it coming, coming my way
Yeah yeah yeah
Ain't never felt so fine
It's for sure, tell you
That you're up on the top one of a kind
You bring your love to me, special delivery
Special delivery, you give your love to me
Who got the love I need
Baby, it's you and I know for sure
You know the way to please
And when I need it you got the cure
Let me tell you now
Ain't no lie, tell you that I
Ain't never felt so fine
It's for sure, tell you
That you're up on the top one of a kind
You bring your love to me, special delivery
Special delivery, you give your love to me
All right, up on the top, one of a kind
You bring your love to me, special delivery
Special delivery, you give your love to me
You bring your love to me, special delivery
Special delivery, you give your love to me
