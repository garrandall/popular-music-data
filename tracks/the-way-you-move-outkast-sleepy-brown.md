Part. 1 (Big Boi ft. Sleepy Brown - The Way You Move)


Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?


I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way


The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho


I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way


Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You driving me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!


I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Part. 2 André 3000 - Hey Ya!


1, 2, 3, uh!


My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)


Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!


You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance


Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest


Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!


Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture


Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do


Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
