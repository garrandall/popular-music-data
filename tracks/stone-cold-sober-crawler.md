Must be something in this life
Everybody in the world is criminal
This rat race of a place
Where we can't live

I don't think
They can blame us, girl
They got the wrong idea
So let's take advantage of
The freedom they gave us
Pack our bags and
Get away from here


'Cause you and me, baby
We have seen this world
Let's take the next train, child
Stone cold sober
Stone cold sober

The stone cold truth
Is they're all the same
Waking up one day
You find that precious thing gone

I don't think that
We can ever agree
That there's more to this life
Than being free



Stone cold sober
Stone cold sober

Stone cold sober
Stone cold sober
