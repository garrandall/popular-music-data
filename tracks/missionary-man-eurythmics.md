Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill
For all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money
Piled up to my chin

My mother told me good
My mother told me strong
She said "be true to yourself
And you can't go wrong
But there's just one thing
That you must understand
You can fool with your brother
But don't mess with a missionary man"

Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man

Well the missionary man
He's got God on his side
He's got the saints and apostles
Backin' up from behind
Black eyed looks from those bible books
He's a man with a mission
Got a serious mind
There was a woman in the jungle
And a monkey on a tree
The missionary man he was followin' me
He said "stop what you're doing
Get down upon your knees
I've got a message for you that you better believe"

Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill
For all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money

Don't mess with the missionary man
The missionary man
The missionary man
A missionary man
Don't mess with the missionary man
