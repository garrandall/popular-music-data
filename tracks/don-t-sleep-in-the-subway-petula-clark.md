You wander around
On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore.

Oh, you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for.

I've heard it all a million times before.
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door.

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
Now you're beside me again.

You try to be smart
Then you take it apart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated.
Um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
That it's all compromise
And the problems are so over-rated.

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show.
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
Now you're beside me again.

Oh, oh, oh.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
Now you're beside me again.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
