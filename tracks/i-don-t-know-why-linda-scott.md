I don't know why
I love you like I do

I don't know why
I just do

I don't know why
You thrill me like you do

I don't know why
You just do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why
I love you like I do

I don't know why
I just do

La da da da...

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why
I love you like I do

I don't know why
I just do

I don't know why
I just do
