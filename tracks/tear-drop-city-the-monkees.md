About as low as I felt in a long time
And I know that I did a wrong at the wrong time
It's plain to see, she's down on me
And I know she'll feel that way for a long time

I was high on top but I didn't know it
Tell me, why did I have to go and blow it?
I used my lines too many times
And now I've got a badly hurt heart to show it

Took me too long to discover
How much I really love her
How'd I ever end up in this bind?
What a drag

There she goes looking for pretty clover
No one knows what it's like until it over
Without a doubt, I just found out
And I suppose I never did get to know her

Tear drop city, Tear drop city

Took me to long to discover
How much I really love her
How'd I ever end up in this bind
What a drag

About as low as I felt in a long time...
