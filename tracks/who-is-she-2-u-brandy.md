G-g-g-get on down
Get, get on down
We be 'bout to do it
Get on, get on down
Brandy
Freak it down


Don't even think about callin' me crazy
You know you peeped that lady, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
And when I turned and look at you you tried
To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends
She was just too nervous ()Ah
She was actin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It kinda got her pissed
I'm kinda wonderin' myself and you're really no help
Tell me how you two know each other so well (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause I wanna know now you better start talkin'


Who is she to you? (Yeah)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Don't lie)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two (Something)
I think you better let me know
That's for sure


No matter how hard you try you can't hide it
There's no way you can deny it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then you wanna flip and call me insecure
I'm only buggin' because you are so suspicious (Are, so, yeah, yeah)
Then you say I don't trust ya (Ah)
Can't understand why I would cuss ya (Ah)
Ya come off so demandin'
So baby I can be, yeah (Yeah)
Now tell me why did you not say
You're wrong in the first place
For lookin' too hard over that way (Too hard over that way)
And you better tell me what the deal is


Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Who is she)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (My eyes)
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know (Let me know)
That's for sure

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
(Something going on) Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure (Wish you better)


Damn right I wanna know her name
Tell me how you know her baby
Why did she make that face?
You look so ashamed
What are you not saying, boy?
I'm really not playin' boy
Gotta know right now
You better start explainin' boy


Who is she to you? (Who is she)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you? (What did you do)
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know (Did you love her?)
That's for sure

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Did you love her?)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (Did you ever do)
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know (I wanna know)
That's for sure

Who is she to you? (Baby, don't lie)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (Tell me the truth)
Something going on between you two (Oh, yes it is)
I think you better let me know
That's for sure (Let me know, who is she)

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (I can see you with her)
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know (Go on after her)
That's for sure
