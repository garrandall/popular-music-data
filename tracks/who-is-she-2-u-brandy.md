C'mon. Watch this. Uh, uh, uh, uh. C'mon. G-G-Get on down. This that soul bounce right here. G-Get on down. B-Rocka...
Usher... Usher... Usher... Uh, uh, uh. What we bout to do. A-Just get on down. Brandy...


Don't even think about calling me crazy. You know you peeped that lady (Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah Yeah). Then when I turned
and looked at you, you tried to play it off. But I could tell that you 2 were friends. 
She was just too nervous. And she was looking like she was hurt. Like a memory had surfaed. It kinda got her pissed. I'm
kinda wondering myself and you're really no help to me. How you 2 know each other so well? Cause I wanna know now. You
better start talking...


Who is she to you? Don't lie to me. Who is she to you? My eyes can see. There's something going on between you 2. I think
you better let me know, that's fa sure.
Who is she to me? Nobody babe. Who is she to me? No need to explain. I ain't done nothing wrong. I swear to you. Ain't
nothing going on but us. That's wassup.


See I don't know why homegirl keeps on lying on everything. I'm not lying (No, no, no. Oh no. No, no, no, no). You make
it worse acting all insecure. She see you bugging so that's why she wants to be spotted, yeah.
Go 'head and say you don't try trust me (trust me)! Always going outta your way to bust me! You come up empty-handed. You
don't understand it. You better go 'head and listen! Girl you got it twisted. Don't be paying that broad no attention.
Cause the one I'm with. Don't be asking me... Yeah...


Who is she to you? Don't lie to me (Who is she). Who is she to you? My eyes can see (My eyes). There's something going on
between you 2. I think you better let me know, that's fa sure.
Who is she to me? Nobody babe. Who is she to me? No need to explain. I ain't done nothing wrong. I swear to you. Ain't
nothing going on but us. That's wassup.


Damn right, I wanna know her name (Why?) Tell me how you know her babe (I don't). Why did you make that face? You look so
ashamed.
I'm not ashamed, I'm surprised you think of me as that guy. I've never done you wrong. What's going on! I don't know who
she is.


Who is she to you? (Who is she) Don't lie to me. Who is she to you? (What did you do) My eyes can see. There's something
going on between you 2. I think you better let me know, that's fa sure.
Who is she to me? Nobody babe (This is crazy...). Who is she to me? (..To think I'd cheat on my baby) No need to explain.
I ain't done nothing wrong. I swear to you. Ain't nothing going on but us. That's wassup.


Who is she to you? Don't lie to me (Don't lie). Who is she to you? My eyes can see (Tell me the truth). There's something
going on between you 2. I think you better let me know, that's fa sure.
Who is she to me? Nobody babe (Nobody baby). Who is she to me? No need to explain (No need to explain). I ain't done
nothing wrong. I swear to you. Ain't nothing going on but us. That's wassup.


Get on down. Get on down. C'mon.
Timbo... We gon get on down. We gon get on down. 
B-Rocka... We gon get on down. We gon get on down.
Timbo the King. Brandy the Queen.
We gon get on down. We gon get on down. We out.
