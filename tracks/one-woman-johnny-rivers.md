Fight my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door
To that little room we call home

Well her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of every day (at the end of every day)
You know it's always been that way

Then I fight my way in the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy on my mind
I open the door
To our favorite little coffee shop
And you know she's right on time
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
That's the way I start my day (that's the way I start my day)
Oh it's too bad so sad it doesn't end that way

One woman's making my home
While the other woman's making me do wrong
I didn't intend to let this thing get that strong
Now I've got to decide where I (where I)
Where I (where I)
Where I belong

One woman's making my home
While the other woman's making me do wrong
Oh I didn't intend to let this thing get that strong
Now I've got to decide where I (where I)
Where I (where I)
Where I belong

One woman's making my home
While the other woman's making me do wrong
I don't know, oh I don't know which one to choose
When neither one, can this man, ever lose
No no no

(One woman's making my home)
One woman's making my home
(While the other woman's making me do wrong)
Making me do wrong
