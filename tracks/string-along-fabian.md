String along, that's all I am is just your
String along, someone that you just seem to
Bring along whenever you are all alone, need some company
You always turn to me
String along (string along), that's all I do is sorta
String along (string along), you never seem to notice
I'm along, I just want you to want me, too
How I hope and pray that you'll need me some day
String along, that's all I am is just your
String along, someone that you just seem to
Bring along whenever you are all alone, need some company
You always turn to me
Treat me wrong (treat me wrong) and maybe soon you'll lose
Your string along (string along), someone may come and bring a
Love that's strong, and wanna string along with me
Find somebody new, won't treat me like you do
String along (string along)
FADE
That's all I am is just your
String along, someone that you just seem to
Bring along
