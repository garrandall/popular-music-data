I broke your heart dear I was untrue and now I've lost you what can I do
I hope you're happy baby for I'll get by too late to worry too blue to cry
Our love has ended you say we're through you found a new love that's all good to you
I'll always love you as days go by
It's too late to worry worry worry I'm too late to cry oh yeah
