I could tell by the way you sounded when you called
That I wasn't going to like what you had to say
I could read between the lines there was something different this time
You're coming over tonight âcause you couldn't wait
Now you're in the drive, I'm a wreck inside as you walk in through that door

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me
You look like I need a drink

Been little over a year since you were standing right here
And I was nervous for a whole ânother reason
Now it's a little bit hard being this caught off guard
Watching you trying to not hurt my feelings

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me
You look like I need a drink

You look like I need a drink

I don't know how this ends or where this goes
But the only thing I know is

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me,
you look like I need a drink
