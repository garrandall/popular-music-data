I could tell by the way you sounded when you called
That I wasn't gonna like what you had to say
I could read between the lines
Somethin' different this time
Your comin' over tonight cause it couldn't wait
Now you're in the drive
I'm a wreck inside as you walk in through that door


You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin' around what you came here to do
But you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin' at me
You look like I need a drink


Been a little over a year since you were standin' right here
And I was nervous for a whole 'nother reason
Now it's a little bit hard bein' this caught off guard
Watchin' you tryin' to not hurt my feelings


You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin' around
What you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin' at me
You look like I need a drink
You look like I need a drink


I don't know how this ends
Or where this goes
But the only thing I know is


You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancin' around what you came here to do
But you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're lookin' at me
You look like I need a drink
You look like I need a drink
Yeah, you look like I need a drink right now


Yeah, like I need a drink
A nice stiff drink
