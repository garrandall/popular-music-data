Let It Snow
Let it snow, Let it snow

Hey, It's another Christmas holiday
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing
Cause we're together
We got a thing can't let it slip away
No, outside it's raining sleet
When our bodies meet
I'll give her the world...


Let it snow, Let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow

Ohhhh, come over here and help me trim the tree
I wanna wrap you up
Baby, then you'll see you're the only present I need
There's so much more
Waiting for you in store
From this precious day
I can gladly say
There's no place that I'd rather be
I know you are my everything, come a little closer
God must have sent you down from heaven


Let it snow, Let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow (wooh wooh)
Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow


Let it snow (let it snow baby),
Let it snow (I don't care about the weather)
Let it snow (oh ooh ooh oh),
Let it snow (leeet it snooow ooh)

I don't care what the weather may be
As long as you're here with me
