Last night I slept alone
I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone babe
No friends to understand
To lend a helping hand
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known

How you walked away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me?
Yes you promised me that you'd never leave boy
But you went away babe
And it's such a shame
How could you turn your back on me?


If you really don't want me
If you really don't need me
If you really don't love me
Tell me who do you love?
If you really don't want me
If you really don't need me
If you really don't love me
Then who do you love?

I gave, gave everything
A man could ever need
I was there whenever you would call me baby
But somehow your feelings changed
You don't act the same
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all

How you walked away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me?
Yes you promised me that you'd never leave boy
Now the love is gone babe
Tell me what went wrong
How could you leave me hanging on? Oh baby



I once was blind but baby now I see
That I'm not the one
Who can fill your every need
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality
Now I know, yes I know
That you're not the one for me
Oh baby, oh yeah
Who do you love baby?
If you don't want me
If you don't need me

How could you walk away from me?
Baby you promised you'd never leave
Slept alone since you've been gone
The greatest pain I've ever known
Oh babe, oh babe oh yeah
