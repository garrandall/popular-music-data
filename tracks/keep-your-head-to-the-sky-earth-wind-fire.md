Master told me one day
I'd find peace in every way
But in search for the clue
Wrong things I was bound to do

Keep my head to the sky
For the clouds to tell me why
As I grew and with strength
Master kept me as I repent and he said

Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

You gave me the will to be free
Purpose to live is reality
Hey and I found myself never alone
Chances came to make me strong

Step right up, be a man
You need faith to understand
So we're saying for you to hear
Keep your head in faith's atmosphere...

Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky
