I just wanna talk to you, I wanna do you no harm 
I just wanna know about your different lives 
And just where people born 
I heard some of you got your families 
Living in cages tall and cold 
Some--just stay there and dust away past the age of old 
Is this true, please let me talk to you 
I just wanna know about the rooms behind your minds 
Do I see vacuum there or am I going blind 
Or is it just the remains the vibrations 
Of actions long ago 
A face like love the world and let your fancy flow 
Is this true, please let me talk to you, let me talk to you 
I have lived here before the days of ice 
And of course this why I am so concerned 
And I come back to find the stars displaced 
And the smell of a world that's burnt 
A smell of the world that is burnt yeah 
Maybe it's just a change of climate, 
I could dig it baby 
I just want to see, so 
Where do I purchase my ticket 
I just like to have a plane--side seat 
I wanna know about the new mother earth 
I wanna hear and see everything 
I wanna hear and see everything 
I wanna hear and see everything 
Ah shucks, 
If my mother could see me now
