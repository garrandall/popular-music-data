I just want to talk to you
I won't uh, do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages, tall and cold
And some just stay there and, dust away
Past the age of old
Is this true? Please let me talk to you
I just want to know about
The rooms behind your minds
Do I see a vacuum there, or am I going blind?
Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoes
Long ago
Things like "Love the World" and "Let your fancy Flow"
Is this true? Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you
I have lived here before, the days of ice
And of course this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
The smell of a world that has burned


Well, maybe, maybe it's just a change of climate
I can dig it, I can dig it baby, I just want to see


So where do I purchase my ticket?
I would just like to have a ringside seat
I want to know about the new Mother Earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
Aw, shucks
If my daddy could see me now
