I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pouring up
I can see in his face
Designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face
That ho give me faith (damn)
That ho give me faithce
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti


I can't go in I ain't ready
I can't go in I ain't ready
That drank on me heavy
I can't go in I ain't ready
I can't go in I ain't ready
Them pills kicking heavy
I can't go in I ain't ready
I can't go in I ain't ready
That 40 too heavy
I can't go in I ain't ready
I can't go in I ain't ready
Just count up my fetti
So
Yeah, So
Mr. Never Lacking
Bust a package, bills can get paid off of rappin'
Still I keep to trappin'
Used to hunnid sack it
Now I fuck a actress
Shit I'm just thinkin how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make it listen
Moving out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loading up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my addictions
Don't talk I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin'
Money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semis and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like Ring on TV, we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Athens
Opiated so I'm demonstrating my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this
Got yo main bitch hoein', shit
Lost a few things as of recent
Life is anything but decent
Blow the re-up on my teeth
Is the only time you catch me cheesin'


I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pouring up
I can see in his face
Designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face
That ho give me faith (damn)
That ho give me faithce
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti


Shipping a pack and it's vacuum sealed
30 on 40, keep that concealed
Just bought a pint, I'm a crack the seal
Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trapping still
Matte black on rover, the bat mobile
Don't trust that nigga cause he gon squeal
Not buying shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I'm faded, off xannies I'm wasted
My bitches they nasty they suck it and taste it
I'm short on my patience, I'm serving my patient
I'm very impatient, little bitch come get naked
Pack coming in but I don't need to weigh it
Choppa en route I shoot once and you spraying
Can't come in my trap the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping thru the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio
3 bitches run to me, that's a perfect ratio
Don't wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred when you see me I let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rolling up the fronto
No mo 'gars cause we rollin out the fronto
I'm in H-town, nigga, and I can never go


I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pouring up
I can see in his face
Designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face
That ho give me faith (damn)
That ho give me faithce
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti on Fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on Fetti
