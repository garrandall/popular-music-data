Your best friend your best girl just made a big messy world
Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap you got caught you should've took her with a grain of salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you
So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin' there's nothin' you can do
So brush that teardrop off your face and put a smile back in its place
Have a little faith and love will come to you

Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue

Have a little faith and love will come to you
So don't be lonely and don't be blue
Your one and only is somewhere waiting just for you
With two lovin' arms to hug your neck
It's right around the corner where your least expect
She'll be there with love to pull you through
Just have a little faith and love will come to you
