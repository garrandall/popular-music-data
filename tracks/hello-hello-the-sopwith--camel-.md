The Sopwith Camel
Miscellaneous
Hello Hello
HELLO HELLO
THE SOPWITH "CAMEL"
Hello hello
I like your smile
Hello hello
Shall we talk awhile?
Would you like some of my tangerine?
I know I'll never treat you mean
Never knew how I'd meet you
Didn't know how to greet you
When I saw you look that way
I knew I had to say
Hello hello hello hello
You've got pretty hair
Hello hello
Can'tcha tell I care?
Would you like some of my tangerine?
I know I'll never treat you mean
Always longed to say I love you
Always been too high above you
Now I'm not so far away
Now at last I can say
Hello hello Hello Hello
