Can a love so right
Be a love so wrong
Oh, does it leave you weak
Instead of strong
Somebody tell me about
This thing called love
Can a love be good
When you feel so bad
Oh, does it make you think
That you're going mad
Somebody tell me about
This thing called love
When I first looked in her eyes
I thought she was the right one
Then I held her close while we danced
And soon started making
Romance, romance, romance
Can a love so real
Be a love so false
Oh, when you hold her near
She's not there at all
Somebody tell me about
This thing called love
When I first looked in her eyes
I thought she was the right one
Then I held her close while we danced
And soon started making
Romance, romance, romance
Can a love so real
Be a love so false
Oh, when you hold her near
She's not there at all
Somebody tell me about
This thing called love
Somebody tell me
About this thing called love
