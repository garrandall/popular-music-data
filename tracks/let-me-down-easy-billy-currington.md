There's a little moonlight, dancin' on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowin' by the ocean as you're takin' my hand
You need to know where I'm standin' now
That I'm right on the edge of givin' in to ya
Baby it's a long way down

If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

The scent of your perfume, floatin' in the air
Lookin' like an angel, lyin' on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look too good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you

If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
So if I fall, can you let me down easy?

If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me, girl, you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
So if I fall, can you let me down easy?
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

Let me down easy babe
Mmm
