Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby let me thrill your soul
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on baby yes this is this
This is the something I just can't miss
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on baby while the thrill is on
Come on baby lets have some fun
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on baby just close the door
Come on baby lets rock some more
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good
When your home
Come on baby
Rock me all night long

Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby let me thrill your soul
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good
When your home
Come on baby
Rock me all night long

Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby let me thrill your soul
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long
