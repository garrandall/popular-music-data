With her wine-stained lips, yeah sheâs nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch but sheâs warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She tasted her break and I canât get more


You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldnât change, no I wouldnât change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldnât change, no I wouldnât change this love


Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me


I am no criminal, just a simple individual
I want it all, need it now, no subliminal
It is not that difficult, here's a visual
Chains and whips, make em strip, I am in control
You play the submissive role, then maybe we switch the role


I'll be your slave, you can have me anyway that you want
You got me insane, you got me insane for your love
And I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love
Got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love


Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul


You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldnât change, no I wouldnât change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldnât change, no I wouldnât change this love

Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
