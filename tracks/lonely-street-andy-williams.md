Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love di-ie

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"
