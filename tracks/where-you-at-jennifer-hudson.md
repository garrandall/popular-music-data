You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery

You said you'd tear down the walls
That were in the way
You promised things would be OK
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you but you never showed

Where you at
Where you at
Where you at
Boy you said you would be there for me
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 

Now you said you'll go to church
Stop slanging find a real job and go to work
And you say you stay out of the streets
And spend more time with me
Take away my doubt and fears
And fulfill my dreams

You said you'd be that shoulder for my eyes to cry on
Said you would be that one that I could depend on
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for ya but you never showed boy

Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Boy you said you'd be there for me
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 
Where you at 

And those false promises is much like fake names
You painted a picture for me but there was no frame
You made my future look bright and I believed every word
I went to sleep on the cloud and woke up in the dirt

And now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing
You said you'd be there for me boy when the tough got going
Said if weapons formed you'd stand in front of me
Whenever I felt trapped you said you'd be the one to set me free

Thought you were my hero
But as it turns out you were no show

Tell me where you at (where you at)
You said you would be there for me
Where you at
You said you'd be right there for me
Where you at 
And I can't see, see, see, see
Where you at 
You said you'd be right there for me

So I'm waiting on ya right here
Until you appear
And deliver
Deliver boy
Deliver
