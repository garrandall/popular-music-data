I'm your man
Yes, I am
Don't have to look no more

Here I am
I'm your man
I'm what you've waited for
Here I am
I'm your man

If you always said you like the way
That I loved you before
Get ready for me 'cause this time
I'm gonna give you it all

'Cause I'm older
I'm wiser
You can bet I'm going to surprise ya
Oh, you know I am
I'm your man

I'm your man
Yes, I am

I
I was afraid of love
So I ran when I was your man
I couldn't give enough
But now I can
Oh, I'm your man

You always said that
You saw something special in me
Now I'm the man
You always dreamed I would be

Believe me
I'm older and I'm wiser
You can bet
I'm going to surprise ya

Oh, you know I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
Yes, I am

I was good then
But now I'm even better
Hey, look at me
I've got it all together
Come on take my hand
I'm your man

I'm your man
Yes, I am
This time
This time
I'm gonna give you a lot

I'm older and I'm wiser
You can bet
I'm going to surprise ya
Oh, you know I am
I'm your man

I'm your man
I'm your man, your man
I'm your man
