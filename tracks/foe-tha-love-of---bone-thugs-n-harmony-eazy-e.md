For the love of money
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

Gotta get on the grind
Pop in the clip of my nine
And bitch if you slip
hit the chalk and fall in the night time
Gotta get mine
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses

Hop on the phone
Call up my nigga, sittin' at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Got a lick we can hit so bring yo shit
'cause once again it's on

To the dome with a fifth of Bourb'
my wig to the curb
so we swerve and rolled out
to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbing the dope-house

Smoke up outta me bong so high,
now comin' to slay
with four grenades
and a gauge I'm 'a play,
watch all of 'em fall in the grave and lay

Pullin' in the driveway,
wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up

Buck, buck, and a kaboom
Me blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed
And gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin'

Snatch up me yummy
So, nigga, don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quat
'cause Flesh be lovin' this money

I'm given up love to the hustlers
All them St. Clair thugstas
makin' that money stayin' on your feet
And you better believe gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep

Steady on the grind, get mine
Stayin' down for mine crime, and I hit up the nine-nine
Givin' up that yayo, makin' me sale, twenties nickles and dimes

Beat up and stick up a lick up, that two-eleven
Gotta get what's mine, then bailin'
Me kickin' up dust, I'm trailing
Feeling one-eight-seven

That's how it is, and I gotsta have it in the nine-quat
Mission to check a mill and still be real
Thuggin' on the Glock-Glock, creeping on a come up
Won't sleep 'til I'm done up
Gotta blaze me a blunt up, hunt up another plot and scheme
Gotta make some green, 'cause soldiers nut up, what up?
Gotta get that business on, even though the Buddha run me, stun me
Feelin' lovely, but I'm just in it for the love of the money

Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

Standin' on the corner straight slangin' rocks
Oh, shit! Here comes the motherfuckin' cops!
So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree
Makin' sure the motherfuckers don't see me

Now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah I stuffed 'em
Police on my drawers, I had to pause
And yeah, it's still motherfuck 'em
Now my game is tight, tight as fuck is my game

Eazy-motherfucking-E or Eric Wright it's all the same
Now niggas might trip on how I stacks my grip
I gotta have it bitch
For the love of this shit
Motherfucker!

Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

Been talking me thugsta, thuggish ways, down for my crime every time
Follow me down the nine-nine, and you will find all of me kind
Check out the ripsta, now, drop down
Run 'em up outta me hood
Rip's straight when makin' me grip with me click
Rollin' with Ruthless, the thug I be

Me put 'em in mud, buck 'em, and pump blood
Got nothing to lose, bitch
You better respect rip, or you best just check this slug
It's goin' down steady pump and peel rounds, gunnin' with a me gang
Bang, gotta make that money man
It's still the same
Steady runnin' thing wild, and follow me now
While I take you up into a barrel of a gun, see
For the dub you're done
For the bud, I run, for the love of my money

Gotta get down for my thing off in this thug game
So peep as me creep and me crawlin' off on the mission to back in the days
When niggas was bailin' with sawed-offs and wanted to get paid
Runnin' to my side, little nigga Ripsta, both on the mission for money
You give up the cash, oh, that was your ass
'cause me and me nigga was hungry

And bitch, if you're stallin' you might just catch one to the temple
And um, Bone raw doggin', so nigga just make this shit simple and run
To catch one nigga me fill 'em with bullets and dump 'em in rivers
Remember, me killer now

For money, me dig you six feet in a ditch and get richer
'cause, bitch, you were slippin'
I'll cut you, and rip you, then buck you down

Steady robbin' and stealin' makin' a killin'
Nigga drug-dealin', needing a million
Hustlin' drugs when the thugs be chillin'
For the money, these niggas be sellin' off in the cut
Where you find a nigga thuggin' off in braids and skullies
And when I stick you and lick you, remember
I get 'em up for the love of the money

Yeah, Bone in the motherfuckin' house for the nine-quats nigga
Yeah, rollin' with Ruthless in this bitch
My nigga Layzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, Wish Bone, And Flesh-n-Bone
And I'm that nigga, Krayzie Bone, in the motherfuckin' house
