So, she said, "What's the problem, baby?"
What's the problem? I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love (Love)
Think about it, every time I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (Love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, oh

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
'Cause everybody's after love

So I said, I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming, all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, oh
These lines of lightning
Mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, come on
Move a little closer
Come on, come on
I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on
Settle down inside my love, ah
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally

Come on, come on
Spin a little tighter
Come on, come on
And the world's a little brighter
Come on, come on
Just get yourself inside her love
I'm in love
