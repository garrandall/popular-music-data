Your other love may be handsome and when he smiles
He's got a twinkle in his eyes
Your other love may be bolder and when he holds you in his arms you wanna die
He says he's loved you from the very start
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday break your heart
Your other love
Says he needs you
Just like a flower need the burning summer sun
Your other love
Says he wants you
Oh how he swears to you
That you're the only one
He claims his future just depends on you
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday prove untrue
He's the jealous kind
Got you hypnotized
Soon you'll realize
Your other love is unfaithful
When you're not there
Another girl is in his arms
Your other love is a lover and he'll make love to any girl who digs his charms
My love is true love not for just a day
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday fly away
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday fly away
