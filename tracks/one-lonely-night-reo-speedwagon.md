You and your baby had some words today
Til not another word was left to say
I see that grin boy
Maybe you think you'll win boy
Until the sun goes down and once again boy


One lonely night
One lonely night
That's all it takes to completely break you

They say it's darkest right before the dawn
But oh those darkest hours can be so long
You're feelin' strong boy
Tellin' yourself she's wrong boy
But how much longer can this night go on boy



Oh she's such a good find
Have you gone and lost your mind
You should know she's one of a kind
