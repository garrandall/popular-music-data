Hey, everybody
Gather round
It's Madison time

Give me a big strong line
And make it hook real fine
We're gonna Madison now
If you don't know how

Listen to my call
Put you on the ball
Madison time

Like, two up, two back
Boss turn, Birdland twice
Reverse that bird, step back over
Rock it back into the Madison
When I say hit it like a rug

Let's, uh, hit it

Two up, two back
Boss turn, looking good
Birdland twice, one more time
Reverse that bird, step back over
Rock it back into the Madison

Oh, the line sure swings
The cat's a Madison king
The line is nice and strong
Couldn't catch a single cat wrong

If you take my call
You'll be on the ball
Madison time

Like, two up, two back
Into the M, erase it
Gimme a I, Johnny
Rock it back into the Madison
When I say like a rug
Hit that thing, hit it
Two up, two back
Into the M

Swinging, son
Erase that thing
Gimme the I
Rock it back to the Madison

You hear the Madison groove
Makes you really wanna move
For kids from eight to eighty-three
Just as easy as can be

It's a relaxing dance
Lets you really prance
The Madison, the Madison
The Madison

The Madison, the Madison
The Madison
