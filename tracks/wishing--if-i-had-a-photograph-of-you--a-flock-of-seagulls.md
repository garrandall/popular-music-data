It's not the way you look
It's not the way that you smile
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair
It's not that certain style
It could be that perfume

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the make-up
And it's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes
Are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
But it must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long
Tell me is it all for nothing
You'll still walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing
