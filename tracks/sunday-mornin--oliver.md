Sunday morning
Sun shining from your eyes
Sleepy face
Smiling into mine

Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday morning

It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday morning

Sunday morning, Sunday morning, Sunday, Sunday
I love Sunday, Sunday morning

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything's alright
Sunday morning
Everything's alright
