How did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me

Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doin' it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be

No more to live without you
All the nights I dream about you

Deep in the dark of the night
I'm a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And I've been saving everyday
I held it all inside, I pray
You don't forget you got me

Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
You'll never be free
That emotion is always replaying

You know the strongest heart
Is broken when it falls
You turn and walk away
And let it die
I got this picture in my head
Of you in someone else's bed
And I am torn apart
I'm torn apart inside

I'll build my world around you
I was nothing when I found you
Paying the price of love

Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doing it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be

Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
You'll never be free
That emotion is always replaying
