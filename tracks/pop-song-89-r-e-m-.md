Hello, I saw you, I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name (name)
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather? (hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government? (hi, hi, hi, hi)

Hello, how are you, I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name (name)
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather? (hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government? (hi)

Hello, my friend, are you visible today?
You know I never knew that it could be so strange (so strange)
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather? (hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government? (hi, hi, hi, hi)
