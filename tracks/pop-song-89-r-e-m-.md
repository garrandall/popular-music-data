Hello, I saw you, I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name (name)
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else


Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)


Hello, how are you? I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name, name
Hello, I'm sorry I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else


Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)



Hello my friend, are you visible today?
You know I never knew that it could be so strange, strange
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else


Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)


(Hi, hi)
(Hi, hi, hi)
(Hi, hi)
(Hi, hi, hi)
(Hi, hi)
(Hi, hi, hi)
