Yea,Yea,Yea
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method


Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
and badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to


As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried


Motion denied 
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya



Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,
customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,
customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god


{hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me


How I look working for a nigga in a cuffe'
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy


(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream


Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me ( get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me


You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws


What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
( try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
( oh it's like that)




(this, this, this really how I look at it check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention


Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash ( yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (Common: where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract


Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right


(is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, ( Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows,
Pimp men ( and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin ( Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house


(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin 'choushi wa dou' ( Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer


(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggaz like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo skinny ass weekly
You'll get all the right tolls in that dashiki


Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher



Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin
Pimps ya'll, hustlers
All that good shit
Yea, yea 2000 and forever
It'll be here
Uh, uh aiight cool
