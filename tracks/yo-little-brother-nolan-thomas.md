I got a brother younger than I
And my little brother's on the wild side
He's hangin' out, gettin' high, always on the scene
And always rappin' to the girls for some...
You know what I mean

And when pop came in tonight, he found
Little brother was not around
He looked up, checked the clock, and said:
"Go and get him from off the block!"

I called, "Yo, yo, little brother
What ya out here trying to discover?
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother!"

I checked every place I thought he might have gone
Until I came across a house with somethin' goin' on
I looked in the window, there was brother and his crew
And he was doing everything a little brother shouldn't do

I knocked and I called his name
He came out with his eyes aflame
I said, "What you doing up after three?"
He said, "You don't know; you better hang with me!"

I called, "Yo, yo, little brother
What ya out here trying to discover?
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother!"

Yo, yo, little brother
What ya out here trying to discover?
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
It's gonna hurt you one way the other!"

I said, "If you think you're cool, don't be a fool
Little brother, come home with me!"
He said: "There's nothing home that can turn me on
That's why I'm out here in the street!"

"And what's up with you? You did it, too
"So don't tell me now to beware!"
I said, "Yeah, I was down, but I turned around
"And that's why I'm still here, little brother!"

Yo, yo, little brother
What ya out here trying to discover?
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother!

Yo, yo, little brother
What ya out here trying to discover?
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
Let's go home and rap with one another

Yo, yo, little brother
Let's go home and rap with one another
Yo, yo, yo, little brother
Let's go home and rap with one another

Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
