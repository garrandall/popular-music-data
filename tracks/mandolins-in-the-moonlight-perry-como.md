( Mandolins in the moonlight!
Beautiful music of love! )

We're not in Venice
In a gondola
Beneath the skies of blue
And yet it seems we're there signorina
An' I'm close to you!

'Cause I hear mandolins in the moonlight
Mandolins in the moonlight!
See what magic you start?
A song of Italy sings
In perfect tune with the strings
Of my heart!

We won't be tossin'
Coins in the fountain
Down in Rome tonight
And yet my dreams come true signorina
When you hold me tight!

'Cause I hear mandolins in the moonlight
Mandolins in the moonlight!
See what magic you start?
A song of Italy sings
In perfect tune with the strings
Of my heart!

Instrumental break

Now, here's the way
They whisper "I love you"
Down in Napoli
"ti voglio bene mia signorina"
And thata goes for me!

'Cause I hear mandolins in the moonlight
Mandolins in the moonlight!
See what magic you start?
A song of Italy sings
In perfect tune with the strings
Of my heart!

Mandolins in the moonlight
Beautiful music of love!
