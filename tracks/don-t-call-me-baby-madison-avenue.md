You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world


Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood


Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby


Behind my smile is my IQ
I must admit this does not sit with the likes of you
You're really sweet
Mmm, you're really nice
But didn't mama ever tell ya' not to play with fire?


Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood


Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby


You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world


Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood


Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
