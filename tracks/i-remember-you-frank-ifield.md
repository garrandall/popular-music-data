I remember you-oh
You're the one who
Made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago!

I remember you-oh
You're the one who
Said: "I love you, too!"
Yes, I do, didn'tcha know?

I remember, too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ohoohhoho-hoo-hoo!

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-oh

I remember, too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Just like the rain out of the blue-ohoohhoho-hoo-hoo!

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you!
