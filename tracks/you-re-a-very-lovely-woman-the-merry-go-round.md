Rhodes

You're a very lovely woman but I think I'd better turn you down this time
'Cause you've used all of your charms on me and I kind of miss the things I left behind
A girl who loves me is thinking of me, my friends but you're a lovely woman
Lovely woman

And now you ask me to forget the things it took me long to get and find
And go away with you again and follow you in sin and drink your wine
I've made my mind up, I will not wind up a life in sin but you're a lovely woman
Lovely woman

And oh, even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly so come back no more
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for

You're a very lovely woman, very lovely, yes you are

And oh, even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly so come back no more
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for

You're a very lovely woman but I think I'd better turn you down this time
'Cause you've used all of your charms on me and I kind of miss the things I left behind
A girl who loves me is thinking of me, my home and friends but you're a lovely woman
Lovely woman
Lovely woman
Lovely woman
