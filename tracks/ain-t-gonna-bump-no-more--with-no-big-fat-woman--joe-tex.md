Three nights ago I was at a disco
Man, I wanted to bump, I was rarin' to go
And this big fat woman, bumped me on the floor
She was rarin' to go, that chick was rarin' to go
Then she did a dip, almost broke my hip
She was gettin' down, that chick was gettin' down
She wanted to bump some more, but I told her, "no!"
You done knocked me down once
You done knocked me down once
Said if you want to dance find you a big fat man
Y'all both can get on down, y'all both can get on down
Huh!

Chorus:
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
Lord, I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
Somebody take her
She's too big for me
She'll knock me down
She came over to me, snatched me out of my seat
She wanted to get on down, still wanted to get on down
I told her to go on and leave me alone
I ain't gettin' down
You done hurt my hip once
I know what you'll do
I ain't gonna bump with you!
I don't feel like gettin' down
Don't feel like gettin' down
She just shook her head at every word I said
She wanted to get on down
That woman wanted to get on down
She did that dip again and I hit the floor again
She was gettin' down, Lord, that woman was gettin' down


Somebody take her, I don't want her
She done hurt my hip, she done knocked
