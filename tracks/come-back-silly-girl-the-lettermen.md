I go round moping, and I go around blue
I made you cry cause I had been untrue
And now I cry for you

CHORUS:
Won't you come back silly girl
Come back to me
Come back silly girl can't you see
I'm in love
Your mother tells me that you're not at home
Each time I call you on the telephone
Oh I'm so lost and alone

CHORUS

Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Don't know how long I can go on this way
I think of you most every day
I only hope and pray

CHORUS

Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love
Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love
Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love

FADE
