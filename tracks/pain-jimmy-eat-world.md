I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know
Gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows


Anyone can make what I have built and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away


It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me


I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit


Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away


It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I can't let it bother me
It takes my pain away


It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me


Takes my pain
Takes my pain
Takes my pain
Takes my pain away
