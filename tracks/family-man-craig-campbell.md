I've been working as a temp 
At the local factory 
I hope they hire me on full time 
I've got shoes to buy 
and a mouth to feed. 

I drive a buy here, pay here truck 
It ain't new, but it is for me 
It ain't much but it fires right up 
and get me from A to B 

What puts the dirt underneath my nails 
What keeps the calluses on my hands 
Family man 

They're a world my world revolves around 
My sacred piece of solid ground 
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand 
They are a fire in my drivin on 
The drive behind my comin home 
The livin, breathin, reason that I am 
A family man 

There's dirty shirts to wash 
Dishes in the sink to do 
And there's how many times 
Does 17 go into 52 
There's bedtime prayers to pray 
Sleep tights and I love you's 
And then there's a pair of eyes 
I get to lose myself into 

What keeps me keepin the faith 
What makes me believe I can 
Family man 

They're a world my world revolves around 
My sacred piece of solid ground 
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand 
They are a fire in my drivin on 
The drive behind my comin home 
The livin, breathin, reason that I am 
A family man 

There's a fire in my drivin on 
The drive behind my comin home 
The livin, breathin, reason that I am 
A family man 

A family man
