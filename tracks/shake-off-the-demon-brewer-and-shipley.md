Shake off the demon see how the angel run
Pull out the powder shoot with the empty gun
You know you burn down the highway and leave me no place to run, to run

So many visions to psychoanalyze
The politician screaming the bleedin' lies
And all the natural children riot for the compromise

Oh, babe, open your window and let that fresh air blow
Hey shake, babe, shake off your demon and watch that angel go, oh no

The priest and preacher talkin' up the holy will
Singin' the glory about how love fulfills
And here's a man from the uniform sayin' he wants to teach you to kill, to kill

Shake off the demon see how the angel run
Pull out the powder shoot with the empty gun
You know you burn down the highway and leave me no place to run

Oh, babe, open your window and let that fresh air blow
Hey shake, babe, shake off your demon and watch that angel go, woaho
