I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?


I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night


But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you


The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following


I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you


I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night


But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you


The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you


Oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night


But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
