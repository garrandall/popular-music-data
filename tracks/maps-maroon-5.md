Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin

And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Ooh 

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before

She will be loved
And she will be loved

Give me something to believe in 
Cause I donât believe in you, anymore, anymore

I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

Wake up call 
caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
donât you care about me anymore?
donât you care about me, well I donât think so

So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Hope that things work out all right

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again
Iâm never gonna leave this bed

And then I give a little more, ooh babe whaoao
Give a little more, ooh babe whaoao

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me

Iâm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away

Itâs always you
You and I go

Baby Iâm preying on you tonight 
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals

So Iâm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following 

Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
(This love has taken its toll on me)
Need a little sweetness in my life
(I am in misery)
Your sugar, yes, please 
(I really wanna love somebody)
Won't you come and put it down on me?
