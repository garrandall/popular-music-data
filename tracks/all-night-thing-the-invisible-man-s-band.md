One, two, three...


Waiting on the band to get started
Hardly room to stand, it's jammed, damn
Oh, child, it's a crowd, now
People wanna dance
People wanna dance
Everybody wanna dance
Move their bodies round
While the music spins
Get down
Get down
Get down
Yeah...
Break out!


Freak on the floor
Freaks on the floor
All the freaks on the floor
All look starry-eyed
Disco whistles blow
Strange freaky vibes
Flashing lights
Of red, blue, yellow and green
It's a funky scene
Plenty for the head
Could only mean...


It's gonna be an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
Baby, it's an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
Yeah, yes it is
Uh-huh
Baby




Dig three-piece Slim-Jim movin' on in
On a chic freak
Come on in
No, I can't blow
Such a hot piece
Shooga booga, honey, could ya?
Move a little close
Close enough for you to hear
Baby, don't ya know?
You got me shifting in fifth gear
You look so fine, and
I want your number in my book
Gonna take you home with me
And get it on
All night long


It's gonna be an all night thing
It's gotta be an all night thing
Baby, it's an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing


All night thing, hello
Move that body, we can party
Everybody been hustling, working all night long
Hustling 9-5 all my life now today I'm gonna live my song
So glad it's Friday, no stopping this party
Move and groove, move and grove (Comin' through)
Move and groove, move that move (Comin' through)
(Let's go to the disco)
(Let's go to the disco)
