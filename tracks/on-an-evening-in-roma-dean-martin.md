Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma


Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma


Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down


So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that's one too few
On an evening in Roma


Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?


Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma


Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?


Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evening in Roma
