When I was young and the world belonged to me
I thought that love meant pain and jealousy
It was a cross on my shoulder
Oh Lord, now I feel so much older, ohohoh

Time had a way of making me see
My lonely life has taken it's toll on me
Now I feel the emptiness
And I don't want to live like this

Now I've heard stories, I've heard songs
Telling me believe my heart don't wait too long
But words they don't ring true
Until there was you

Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
Until the end of time

How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel?
How deep my soul, how much can I reveal?
I'm lost in love's mystery
Caught between time and eternity

Now there's a door that opens wide
Slowly I will find my way and reach inside
But I couldn't make it through
Until there was you

Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
And only when I see the light of love shine
Until the end of time

Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
And only when I see the light of love shine
Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
And when I see the light of love shine
In your eyes when they meet mine
Only then I'll know it's you and I
Until the end of time
