Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands

A little softer, people get softer
A little softer, people get down low
A little softer, people get softer
A little softer, people get down low
A little louder, people get louder
A little louder, people get louder
A little louder, people get louder
A little louder, people get louder

We gon' let guitar man
Go through his pace
Listen to the strings y'all
Listen how they ring

Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
