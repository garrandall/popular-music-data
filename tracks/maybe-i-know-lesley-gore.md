Maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?

I hear them whispering when I walk by
'He's gonna break her heart, and make her cry'
I know it's me they're talking about
I bet they all think I'll never find out

But maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?

My friends are telling me that he's no good
He isn't treating me the way he should
'He really loves me,' that's all I can say
Before my tears fall, I just walk away

Oh, but maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?

Whoa'
Deep down inside he loves me
Though he may run around
Deep down inside he loves me
Someday he'll settle down

Oh, maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?

'He really loves me,' that's all I can say
Before my tears fall, I just walk away

Oh, maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?

Oh, maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?
