(someone shouting: I love you!)
Still uh? faithful. wait... wait. if I would have known there were so many
People on the two sides here I would have had my nose fixed! never! these
People are too smart...
This time we almost
Made the pieces fit
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost
Made some sense of it
Hum... didn't we, love?
This time I had the answer
Right here in my hand
Then I touched it
And it had turned to sand
This time we almost
Sang our song in tune

Didn't we, love?
This time we almost
Made it, made it
To the moon
Oh, didn't we, love?
This time we almost
Made a poem rhyme
This time we almost
Made that long hard climb
Didn't we almost
Make it?
Didn't we almost
Make it?
Didn't we almost
Make it?
This time...
