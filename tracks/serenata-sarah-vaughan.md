Tonight while all the world is still
Fly sweet song over the highest hill
Go to my loved one, Serenata for me
Sing him my song, love's melody

Tonight, when we are so far apart
Bring him back, back to my lonely heart
Go to my loved one Serenata and say
When you're in love, love finds a way

Go to my loved one Serenata for me
Sing him my song, love's melody

Go to my loved one, Serenata and say
When you're in love, love finds a way
Love finds a way, love finds a way
Love finds a way
