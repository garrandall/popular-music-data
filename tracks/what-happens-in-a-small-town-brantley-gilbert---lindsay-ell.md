I can't go for a ride to clear my head
'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it
Yeah, we're done, moving on
But you can't be too far gone

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here
And you ain't around

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

Oh, we said this goodbye was the last
I guess I could leave, I could run from the past
And from us, and from you
But this is where I belong, this is my home too

What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here
And you ain't around

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

And I'm still here
And every time I see that little white Jeep
Yeah, that hand-me-down Ford pulling down your street
I wonder if somebody's in my seat
If you're moving on, or you're stuck like me?

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Oh yeah

What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here
And you ain't around (you ain't around)

'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Stays in a small town
Stays in a small town
Now I'm still here
(What happens in a small town)
I'm still here
(Stays in a small town)
I'm still here
Yeah I'm still here
I'm still here
