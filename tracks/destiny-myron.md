It's gotta be destiny
It's gotta be destiny
I've never been superstitious
Love don't always play fair
Opportunity so delicious
Like none that I've known anywhere
So I take the chance to hold your hand
And I hope that you would undestand
But it all happend so suddenly
And now you are in love with me
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
Oh no it's no taboo
This moment is so beautiful
But it's more like Dejavu
Could it be that I have dreamed of you
It's natural the way we bond
Makin' love from 9 beyond
Why don't this seem strange to me
It's cause you are my destiny
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
I never thought this would be
This feeling that came over me
Gotta be my destiny
I never thought this would be
This feeling that came over me
Gotta be my destiny
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
It's gotta be destiny
She's taken me
It happened so suddenly
Destiny
