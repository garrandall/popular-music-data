I'm amazed Lord how You make all things new
You're faithful and You always bring me through
The more I see
Your plan for me
My destiny is victory

I give You my life
I wanna be more
I wanna be more like You
And I fix my eyes on You
You're making me more
You're making me more like You

I'm amazed how You make all things new
(And You're faithful)
And You're faithful and You always bring me through
(Every time You bring me through)
The more I see (the more)
Your plan I see (You're plan for me)
My destiny (my destiny) is victory

I give You my life
I wanna be more
I wanna be more like You
And I fix my eyes on You
You're making me more
You're making me more

You changed me
