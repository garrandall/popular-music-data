If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)
Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or "umberellas" in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)
Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or "umberellas" in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz

Down, down
Uptown
Get your kicks at the Ritz
Dine and wine, but not 'till nine
The time is right for us tonight
We can move, move to the rhythm
We can-

Move, dance to the rhythm (Nice and easy)
I want 'ya to move
Put it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on
R-I-T-Z, how about you and me says-

Gotta dance
Gotta dance
