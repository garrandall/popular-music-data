We got it together, didn't we?
We've definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't that nice?
I mean, really, when you really sit and think about it, isn't it really, really nice?
I can easily feel myself slipping more and more ways
That super world of my own
Nobody but you
And me
We've got it together, baby
Ohhhh oh


The first, my last, my everything
And the answer to
All my dreams
You're my sun (sun)
My moon (moon-on)
My guiding star
My kind of wonderful
That's what you are


I know there's only
Only one like you
There's no way
They could have made two
You're you're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep forevermore
(You're the first)
You're the first
(My last)
You're the last
My everything


In you
I found
So many things
A love so new, only you
Could bring
(Can't you see it's you?)
Can't you see it's you? (you, you)
You make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew
On a brand new day


I see so many ways that I
Can love you 'til
The day I die
You're my reality
Yet I'm lost in a-a-a-a dream
(You're the first)
You're the first
(You're the last)
The last
My everything


Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh


I know there's only
Only one like you
There's no way
They could have made two
Girl, you're my reality
But I'm lost in a-a-a-a dream
(You're the first)
You're the first
(You're the last)
You're the last
(My everything)
My everything


You and me babe
It's you
And me
And you are the first
The last
My everything
