Disappointed youth
Where is all the flash
I can't be uncouth
I can speak no trash

What's gonna happen to me
Don't want to turn out to be

Top40db.org

Not another nice girl

Wanna stay out late
With those ostracized guys
Silver glitter on my face
Smear a little round my eyes

What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl

Oh, what a shame
She's nobody's dream
She's got nothing to say
Remains lonely and clean

Body pressure up
Gets my fantasies wound
Wanna eat you up
Pull you down to the ground

Whats gonna happen if she
Spends her life all pristine
Like a proper nice girl

Such a game, middle class
Throwing sticks in the mud
Shame, shame, shame middle class
Nipping girls in the bud

Wanna stay out late
With those ostracized guys
Silver glitter on my face
Smear a little round my eyes

What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl

What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl
