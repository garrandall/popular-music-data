Ohohooh.
Ohohoohhoh,ohah

You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time
You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time

I hear you're his new lover
You two deserve one another
Breakin' hearts must be your new pastime
Right now everything seems cozy
Is he sending you candy and roses?
I'd like to see how it's feeling a month from now

You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time
You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time

He'll love you then he'll leave you
Mark my words, he's only gonna grieve you
He's had enough once he's gained your heart
He'll tell you it's forever
Say the right things to make you think he's clever
That's too bad, I thought you were much too smart
Much too smart

You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time
You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time

He'll make you, he'll make you
He'll make you fall in love, whoa-whoa, girl
He'll break your, he'll break your
He'll break your, break your heart, ohooh.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la

You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time
You're just the next love in line
Causin' the commotion this time

He'll break your, he'll break your
He'll make you fall in love, oh-whoa, girl
He'll break your, he'll break your
He'll break your, break your heart...
