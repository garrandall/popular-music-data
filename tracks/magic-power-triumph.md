Something's at the edge of your mind
You don't know what it is
Something you were hoping to find 
But you're not sure what it is
Then you hear the music 
And it all comes crystal clear
The music does the talking
Says the things you want to hear

I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me

She climbs into bed
She pulls the covers overhead 
And she turns her little radio on
She's had a rotten day 
So she hopes the DJ's 
Gonna play her favorite song

Makes her feel much better
Brings her closer to her dreams
A little magic power
Makes it better that it seems

She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me
She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me

You're thinking it over 
But you just can't sort it out
Do you want someone to tell you 
What they think it's all about
Are you the one and only 
Who's sad and lonely
You're reaching for the top
Well, the music keeps you going 
And it's never gonna stop
It's never gonna stop
It's never gonna, never gonna, never gonna, never gonna stop

The world is full of compromise
And infinite red tape
But the music's got the magic
It's your one chance for escape
Turn me on, turn me up
It's your turn to dream
A little magic power 
Makes it better than it seems

I'm young now, I'm wild now, I want to be free
Got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young now, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music
I got the music in me

I got the power
I got the magic
She's got the power
She's got the magic
She's got the power
She's got the magic
She's got the power
She's got the magic
