I have a mansion
Forget the price
Ain't never been there
They tell me it's nice

I live in hotels
Tear out the walls
I have accountants
Pay for it all

They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far

My Maserati
Does one eighty-five
I lost my license
Now I don't drive

I have a limo
Ride in the trunk
I lock the doors
In case I get drunk

I make hit records
My fans they can't wait
They write Tim letters
Tell Glenn Don's great

So I got me an office
Gold records on the wall
Just leave a message
Maybe I'll call

Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody says) I'm cool (He's cool)
I can't complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far

I go to parties
Sometimes until four
It's hard to leave
When you can't find some more

It's tough to handle
This fortune and fame
Everybody's so different
We're all insane

They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
(Everybody says) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
I keep on going guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah
