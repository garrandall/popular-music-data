Our love's becoming a thing of the past (x2)
Your kisses taste like it's goodbye
My eyes know they're gonna cry
I feel I'm losing you too fast, oh yeah
And our love's becoming a thing of the past

What happened to those happy hours
And where is the sweet bouquet of flowers
I'm so afraid the die is cast, oh yeah
And our love's becoming a thing of the past

You used to call me your sugar baby
Now I say call me, you tell me maybe
If you don't love me, stop pretending
Who needs a book with a heartbreak ending

This is the moment to decide
Don't be influenced by foolish pride
Let's try to make our little love last, oh yeah
Because our love's becoming a thing of the past
Remember, every other time we love
Our love's becoming a thing of the past
Darlin', tell me I've been dreamin' 'bout it
Our love's becoming a thing of the past
