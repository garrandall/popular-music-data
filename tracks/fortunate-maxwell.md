Never seen a sun shine like this
Never seen the moon glow like this
Never seen the waterfalls like this
Never seen the lights off like this
Never dug anyone like this
Never had tasty lips to kiss
Never had someone to miss
Never wrote a song quite like this



Fortunate to have you girl,
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.



Never had room service all night
Never took a trip first class flight
Never had a love affair so tight
I've never felt a feeling so right
Never seen a winter so white
Never had words to recite
Never had a flame to ignite
And I never sang a song with all my might.



Silence child hope you hear
I'm callin out to your body
Baby you know just what to do
Close the door no interlude
