I'm a fool to care
When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do

I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry
When you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue
When you were untrue

I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh
And call it a day
But I know I would cry
If you went away

I'm a fool to care
When you don't care for me
So why should I pretend
I'll lose in the end
I'm a fool to care

I'm a fool to care
When you don't care for me
So why should I pretend
I'll lose in the end
I'm a fool to care
