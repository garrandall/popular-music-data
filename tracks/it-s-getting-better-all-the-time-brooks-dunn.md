I don't stop breathing everytime the phone rings
My heart don't race when someone's at my door
I've almost given up thinking you're ever gonna call
I don't believe in magic anymore
I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God to get you off my mind
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This ol' job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
But at least I don't have whiskey on my breath
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

God I hope you're happy
Girl I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell

I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If I ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night, I couldn't say a word
I stood there in the dark all by myself
Yeah, I could have said a million things
But all I did was keep it locked inside
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

It's gettin' better all the time
