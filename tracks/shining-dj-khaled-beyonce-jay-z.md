Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin', yeah)
All of this winnin', I've been losin' my mind, yeah (losin' my mind)
Oh, hold on (hold on, baby)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Hold on (hold on)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Slow me down


Oh, the nana make him act a fool for it
You gon' need an address when I lose the boy (boy)
Ratchet, ratchet, ratchet, you a tool, lil' boy, oh
Mama say I'm trippin', daddy say I'm trippin'
Mouth talkin' dirty but my lips so clean
On my body like a bumper car sticker
Bet it make you smile when you see that bitch pull up (pull up)

Money don't make me happy (make me happy)
And a fella can't make me fancy (make me fancy)
We smilin' for a whole 'nother reason (whole 'nother reason)
It's all smiles through all four seasons


Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin', yeah)
All of this winnin', I've been losin' my mind, yeah (losin' my mind)
Oh, hold on (hold on)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Hold on (hold on)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Slow me down, yeah


I drop the top out the coupe
They tryna get at me, oh
They say I'm sweet just like D'UUUUUUS'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Said everything I do, yeah, yeah, yeah
Petty, petty, petty, I've been winnin' steady
YoncÃ©, YoncÃ© all up on your grill, lil' boy
Poppin' off at the mouth, all year, boy
Came out '97, winnin' 20 years, boy, oh
All of this good, I don't feel bad for it, yeah
When you see me smile, you can't be mad at it, yeah

Money don't make me happy (make me happy)
And a fella can't make me fancy (make me fancy)
We smilin' for a whole 'nother reason (whole 'nother reason)
It's all smiles through all four seasons


Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin', yeah)
All of this winnin', I've been losin' my mind, yeah
(Losin' my mind, losin' my mind)
Oh, hold on (hold on)
Don't try to
Slow me down (down}
Hold on (hold on)

Ayy don't (don't) try to (try to) hold me (down) down
Don't (don't) try to (try to) hold me down, ayy


(Another one)
Make 'em wait


One ain't enough, I need two
That night I mix the Ace with the D'US'
Hit a triple-double in the Garden
Held up my left wrist like I'm Harden (swish)
Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes
The European trucks for the twin babies
Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, haha (oh)
Send him to school in all my jewels, haha
I want a boy and girl to fight for truth
Whatever God give me, I'm cool
I've been winnin' so long it's like alchemy
I've been playin' cards with the house money
21 Grammys, I'm a savage nigga
21 Grammys, I'm a savage nigga
I shouldn't even worry, backward niggas
12 solo albums, all Platinum, nigga
I know you ain't out here talkin' numbers, right?
I know you ain't out here talkin' summers, right?
I know you ain't walkin' 'round talkin' down
Sayin' boss shit when you a runner, right?
Plain Patek, been had it
Flooded when I got it from Khaled
That was just a thank you for his last year
Next year he gon' have to buy a palace, shinin'


Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin', yeah)
All of this winnin', I've been losin' my mind (losin' my mind)
Oh, hold on (hold on, baby)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Hold on (hold on)
Don't try to
Slow me down
Slow me down, yeah


Just because you say things are gonna change
Things are gonna change, things are gonna change
(All of this winnin', slow me down)
-ing something's wrong isn't good enough
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough
(All of this winnin', yeah)
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough
