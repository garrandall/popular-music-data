La la la la

Al di la means you're far above me
Very far (very far)
Al di la, as far as the
Lovely evening star (very far)

Where you walk, flowers bloom
When you smile all the gloom
Turns to sunshine

And my heart opens wide
When you're gone, it fades
And seems to have died

Al di la, I asked as I drifted
Where you were (where you were)
Al di la, and then the fog lifted
There you were (there you were)

In the kiss that I gave
Was the love I had saved
For a lifetime

Then I knew, it was true
And I knew all of you
Was completely mine

La la la la

Al di la, I asked as I drifted
Where you were (where you were)
Al di la, and then the fog lifted
There you were (there you were)

In the kiss that I gave
Was the love I had saved
For a lifetime

Then I knew (then I knew)
It was true (it was true)
And I knew all of you
Was completely mine

La la la la
You were completely mine
La la la la
You were completely mine
