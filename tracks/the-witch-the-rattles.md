Can't you see me runnin'
I am really runnin'
For my life
Guess from where I'm
Comin'
Guess why I'm runnin
For my life

Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side

Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side

Can't you see my deathfear
I can hear her voice
Shoutin' everywhere
Who know what I've could done
It must be so bad
That a witch does care

Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side

Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side
