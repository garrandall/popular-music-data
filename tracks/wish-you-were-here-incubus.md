I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds
Strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind
Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a back-lit canopy
With holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter 
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
Wish you were here

The world's a roller coaster
And I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air
Saying

I wish you were here 
I wish you were
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
