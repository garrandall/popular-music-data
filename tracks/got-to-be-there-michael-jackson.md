Got to be there, got to be there
In the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there
Bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me

So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning

And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, "hello world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me, she's home

Got to be there
Got to be there
