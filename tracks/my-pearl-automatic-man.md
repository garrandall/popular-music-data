Ooh, ooh...

As long as time allows
You'll be my treasure queen
What you mean to me
Got a whole lotta
Boom, boom, boom

Girl, there's something
About your smile
Don't you wait too long, ooh
Pretty lady, let me
Put you where you belong

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl
My precious little girl

Enchanted lovers
That what we'll be
And see that we'll
Always be this way

Girl, there's something
About your smile
To wait too long, ooh
Pretty lady, let me
Put you where you belong

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl, yeah
My precious little girl

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl, ooh hoo
My precious little girl

My precious little girl
My precious little girl
My precious little girl
Can't you see you're
My precious little girl

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl, ooh, you're
My precious little girl

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl, you're my
My precious little girl

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl, ooh, you're
My precious little girl

Hey, hey, hey
My precious little girl
My pearl, yeah
My precious little girl...
