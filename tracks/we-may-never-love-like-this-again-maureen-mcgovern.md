We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go
We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Though we may try

So, while we're here
Let's give out all
Release the dreams inside us
And set them free
Oh, while we're here
Let's leave a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us

We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the hills
I'll see you reaching out to hold me
I don't know just where or when
Still, I'm sure
We'll love again
We'll love again

We'll love again
(We may never love like this again)
We'll love again
(We may never love like this again)
...
