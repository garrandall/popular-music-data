I am yours and you are mine
Come what may
Love like ours remains divine
Come what may

Even though we're miles apart
You're living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start
And fall the long, long day

I got your picture near me
Since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips
Each night and day

Bear in mind that you will find
A heart that is true
And I'll be here for you
Come what may

I got your picture near me
Since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips
Each night and day

Bear in mind that you will find
A heart that is true
And I'll be here for you
Come what may

And I'll be here for you
Come what may
And I'll be here for you
Come what may
