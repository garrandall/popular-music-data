When the truth is found to be lies
You know the joy within you dies

Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You Better find someone to love

Find somebody to love
Find somebody to love
Find somebody to love

When the dawn is rose, they are dead
Yes and you're mine, you're so full of red

Your eyes, I say you eyes may look like his
Yeah, but in your head, baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is

Tears are running
Running along down your breast
And your friends baby
They treat you like a guest
