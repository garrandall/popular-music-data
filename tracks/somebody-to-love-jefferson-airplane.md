When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies


Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
Love, love


When the garden flowers
Baby are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red


Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love


Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is


Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love


Tears are running
They're all running down your breast
And your friends, baby
They treat you like a guest


Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
