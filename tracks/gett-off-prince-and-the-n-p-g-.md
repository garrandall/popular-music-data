Boy, we gettin' ready to get funkier than a sack of grandaddies
1, 2
1, 2, 3
Heh heh, roll it (Gett off)
(Gangster) (Gett off)
(Gangster) (Gett off)
Yeah, summertime
(Gangster) (Gett off)
(Get on up and jam)

Well as I G-E-double-T-O-F-F
Gangster Glam in the house and I must confess, see
That this is the shit P
Servin' them a New Power Soul
For those who would ever try to rock the NPG
For those who are wondering, a family is born
And God bless us cause we're funky
Everything we do is on a positive tip
And got a message for a sucker with lip
Tell 'em, Rosie
(Let a woman be a woman and man be a man)
Yeah, you tell 'em, baby
And as I put the Mmm in Man
I'm kickin' the Gangster Glam

Gangster (hahaha) (Gangster)
Gangster glam (Gangster)
I'm kickin' the Gangster Glam
Gangster (Gangster)
Gangster glam (Get on up and jam)

Well as I G-E-double-T-O-F-F
Ganster Glam in the house (Gangster)
The style we're sportin', the ladies and the fellas, hmmm
Godfather III meets Barbarella...
Hmm, you can believe, a gangster never thinks twice

(Gangster)
(Gangster glam)
What ya say fellas?
(Gangster)
(Get on up and jam)
Roll it

Gangster (Gangster)
Gangster glam
It's summertime and I'm rollin' (Get on up and jam)
Send the shout out
(Power 2 the people of M-P-L-S...)
Send the shout out

What's my BMW definition?
The Black Man's Wish
All the heads of the family
Will fall when we drop this
And the fact that we're funky
Will keep the jeeps boomin' for the hip-hop junkies

(Everybody grab a body, pump it like you want somebody)
(Get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)
I'm kickin' the Gangster Glam
(Everybody grab a body, pump it like you want somebody)

And see you lipsynchin' suckers
Listen, we don't go for that
And you can believe we're bringin' the live performance back (Gangster)
So don't you come to the concert tonight
Cuz we'll send you home wishin' that you had came right
Mmm, clockin' the jizz, gettin' the bizz
Playin' strip pool with Vanessa
Sweatin' in my typhoon (Gangster) (Get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)
Yeah, that's my 'do, fool

(Gett off) Gangster glam (Get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)
It's summertime and I'm rollin'
(Gett off) Gangster (Get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)
Yeah
(Gett off) Gangster glam (get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)

Groovin' to the Gangster Glam
With the fellas (Gangster)
The Beamer - Chiquita yellow
Clockin' all the jizz (Get on up and jam)

Gangster (Gangster)
I love you
Yeah, I love you too, I love you too
Gangster glam

Are you funky?

Then ride it, hahahaha
Gangster (Gangster glam)

(Get-get-get-get-get-get on up and jam)

Gangster grands (Gangster)
Groovin' to the Gangster Glam

Groovin' to the Gangster Glam (Gangster)
