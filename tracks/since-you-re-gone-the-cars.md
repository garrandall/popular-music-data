Since you're gone
The nights are gettin' strange
Since you're gone
Well, nothing's makin' any sense
Since you're gone
I stumbled in the shade
Since you're gone
Everything's in perfect tense, well

I can't help it
When you fall apart
I (and I) can't help it
Guess you better start

That is forgettin' about you
(Since you're gone)
Since you're gone
Nights are gettin' strange
(Since you're gone)
Since you're gone
Throwin' it all away
(Since you're gone)
Since you're gone
The nights are gettin' strange
(Since you're gone)
Since you're gone
Thrownin' it all away

I can't help it
Everything's a mess
I can't help it
You're so treacherous
When it comes, to tenderness
(Since you're gone)
I can't help it
Everything's a mess
I can't help it
You're so treacherous
Oh, where's that tenderness?
(Since you're gone)

Since you're gone
I missed the peak sensation
(Since you're gone)
Since you're gone
I took the big vacation
(Since you're gone)
Well, never feel sedate
(Since you're gone)
Well, the moonlight ain't so great
(Since you're gone)

Since you're gone
(Since you're gone)
Well, I've thrown it all away
(Since you're gone)
When the night (?)
(Since you're gone)
Strange I've thrown it all away
(Since you're gone)
Well, since you're gone
(Since you're gone)

Since you're gone
Since you're gone
(Since you're gone)
I've thrown it all away
(Since you're gone)
