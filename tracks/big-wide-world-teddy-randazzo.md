Yes it's a big wide world we live in,
But I can't believe it's true;
Out of everyone in this whole wide world
I fell in love with you?.

I traveled everywhere
I have had a love or two
But every love affair; reminds me of you

And it's a big wide world we live in,
But I can't believe it's true;
Out of everyone in this whole wide world
I fell in love with you?.

It's been a year or two,
We've gone our separate ways
But I still think of you; both night and day

And it's a big wide world we live in,
But I can't believe it's true;
Out of everyone in this whole wide world
I fell in love with you?.

It's funny we should meet
In our old rendezvous
I searched the world to find
There's no one like you

And it's a big wide world we live in,
But I can't believe it's true;
Out of everyone in this whole wide world
I-- fell? in-- love? with-- you?.
