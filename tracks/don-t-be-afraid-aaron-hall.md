Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

You’ll be saying “Daddy” to me
But please don’t hurt me
This is my first experience, baby
Make it feel alright, don’t worry baby

Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid, baby
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don't be afraid, girl

When I lay you down tonight
Ask me to hold you tight
Everything will be alright
Don’t be afraid, baby
When you start to scratch and moan
And your problems are long gone
Let it happen right now
Don’t be afraid, girl

Now I have you all to myself
You can put all the other guys all on the shelf
No need to run and no need to hide
All the doors are locked baby and I have you inside
You can yell and you can hit me
It just makes me horny
Ain’t nothing but a love thing baby
Between me and you
So just give in baby, don’t worry about a thing


Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid, baby
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don't be afraid, girl


When I get through with you
Ain’t nobody else that you will want to go to
I put all the men to shame
Remember baby, this is a nasty man’s game


Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid, baby
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid
Don't be afraid, baby


Deep down, feel so lucky girl to have you in my arms
But now its time to go baby, need for an alarm
Go to sleep my baby, like i said everythings alright
Rest your head on my tattooed my chest
I know it feels real good
Oohwee baby, no need to be afraid
The lights are off and I open the sheets
So kiss me baby, Say it so one more time
For the road baby, I’m right again
Give me the center baby don’t be afraid

Don’t be a-
Don’t be a-
Don’t be afraid (repeat over until fade)
