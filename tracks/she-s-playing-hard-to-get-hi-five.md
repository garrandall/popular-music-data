She likes me

She's playing
She's playing hard

She's playing hard to get
She's playing
She
But she likes me
She likes me

She's playing hard to get
She's playing
She
But she likes me

She likes me
She likes me
She's playing


I can tell by the look in her eyes
That she's into me
'Cause when she passes by and say "Hi"
I can tell by her smile

That she's shy as can be
(She's playing)
I don't think she can see my crush on her
But I can feel her crush on me


She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
That she likes me
She likes me

She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
Oh yeah
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playing hard


I can feel her vibe for me
Even though she hasn't said a word
I bet she's glad I'm reading her mind
'Cause there's so much ('cause there's so much)
She wants to say

But she doesn't have the nerve
And all that she doesn't say
Oh, I'm sure
I see it in her eyes




You don't have to say a word (playing hard)
But I'll still know
I'll still know
How deep the feelings are
You have for me

Your smile
And the look in your eyes
Says more than any words you could ever say

Come on, baby girl
So why are you doing this?
Playing hard to get
I know that you want me
I see it in your eyes

You can't hide it
You're playing hard to get
Playing hard to get
I don't think she can see my crush on her
But I can feel her crush on me
