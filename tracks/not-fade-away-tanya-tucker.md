I'm gonna say how it's gonna be you're gonna give your lovin' to me
Love that lasts more than one day love is love and not fade away
My love is love and not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac I'll try to show it if you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real fore you'd have noticed how I feel
I said love is real and not fade away I said love is real and not fade away

( guitar )
I'm gonna say how it's gonna be you're gonna give your lovin' to me
Love that lasts more than one day well love is love and not fade away
I said love is love not fade away
Not fade away not fade away love is real and not fade away
I said love is real and not fade away not fade away not fade away
Love is real and not fade away...
