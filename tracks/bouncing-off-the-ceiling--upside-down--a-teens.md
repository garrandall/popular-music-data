Up... side down
Upside down
Upside down


My grades are down from A's to D's
I'm way behind in history
I lost myself in fantasies
Of you and me together


I don't know why - I - I, but dreaming's all I do
I won't get by-I-I on mere imagination


Upside down
Bouncing off the ceiling
Inside out
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
To you


My teacher says to concentrate
So what; his name was Peter the Great
The kings and queens will have to wait
'Cause I don't have forever


I wish that I - I - I could walk right up to you
Each time I try- I-I the same old hesitation


Upside down
Bouncing off the ceiling
Inside out
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
To you


Somehow, someday
You will love me too
One day will be the day when all my dreams come true
(Ha ha!)


Up... side down
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah


Upside down
Bouncing off the ceiling
Inside out
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Upside down
Bouncing off the ceiling
Inside out
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to...
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to...
And I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
