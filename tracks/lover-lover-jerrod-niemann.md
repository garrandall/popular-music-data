Well the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away

I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never coming back

Girl, but before I get to goin' I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burning you got to do what's right

Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well the truth
Yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away

I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never coming back

Girl, but before I get to goin' I got to say
There was a time oh woman when you used to shake it for me
But now all you do is just treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
No good no more more more
Whoa, lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well I wait up for you almost every night
And I'm hurtin' so bad 'cause you don't treat me right
Oh woman oh woman you know I love you so
You're just so mean to me baby
I'm walking out the door

Lover oh lover
I know you used to love me in every way
But now I'm giving up
And I'm tired of crying babe
I can't stand it no longer
It hurts me to say
But I'm packing up my bags and going far away

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
