When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through 
You understand everything that I do 
It's not a wonder that I care for you 

And so babe, it's only fair we should hold on tight 
Please be careful just to follow the light 
I promise everything will be alright 

Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love 
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of 

When you're down, I will be there, you can count on me 
It's just so easy anyone can see it's not a wonder that you care for me 

Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love 
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of 

When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through 
You understand everything that I do 
It's not a wonder that I care for you, 
Oh no it's not a wonder that I care
