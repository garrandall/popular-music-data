Na na, na na na na
Cam on, cam on, cam on, oh
Ohh, this is just for me
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na


Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I got to do something special for me
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Got to take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about, sing


Oh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, oh baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need


One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah


Tonight, it's all about me
Just want to set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight, I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The Isley Brothers going to hold it down, sing


Oh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, oh baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need


One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful


Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I need one of those days
You don't know how, oh oohohoh


One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful
