The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go
So won't you please

Be my, be my, be my little baby
My one and only baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
My one and only baby

I'll make you happy, baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me
I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity so won't you please

Be my, be my, be my little baby
My one and only baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
My one and only baby
