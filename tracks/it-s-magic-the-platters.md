You sigh and the song begins
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
(It's magic)

The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic
(It's magic)

Without a 
One or mystic charm
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
Oh, it's magic
(It's magic)

How else can I explain
Those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic, why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true

When within my heart I know
The magic is my love for you?
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true

When within my heart I know
The magic is my love for you?
(The magic is my love for you)
