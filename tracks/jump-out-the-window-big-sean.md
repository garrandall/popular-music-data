I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think Iâm ready to jump out the window

Know ya momma didn't raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check
You, you cried on my phone the whole night that time he crossed the line, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I was there
I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah

The question isn't "Do he love ya?"
The question is "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess
Way back then we the best thing that never happened, but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation?
What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation,
You need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill.
Look

Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needing clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity
Hear me

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So, yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth I gotta know

I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend
This one's for you, you, you, you
