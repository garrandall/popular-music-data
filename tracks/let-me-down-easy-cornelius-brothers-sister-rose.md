Tell me I'm wrong
About losing you
Tell me I'm wrong
This just can't be true

I know you're dying down
Because it's so plain to see, oh yeah
I know you're gonna drop me
But please do it this way for me

Oh, let me, let me down easy
Oh, let me, let me down easy
So the pain won't hurt so bad
Hurt you so badly

Tell me I'm wrong
About losing you
Tell me I'm wrong
This just can't be true

I could tell each time you kiss me
There's something wrong definitely
If your love is dying down
Please do it this way for me

Oh, let me, let me down easy
Oh, let me, let me down easy
So the pain won't hurt so bad
Hurt you so badly

I know I can't convince you
No matter how hard I try
So, please break it to me easy
If you don't I'm gonna die

Oh, let me, let me down easy, I beg you
Let me, let me down easy
Oh, let me, let me down easy
Oh yeah, let me, let me down easy
