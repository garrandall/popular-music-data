Reach out
Reach out for the medal

Reach out
Reach out for the gold
Come play to win
Never give in

The time is right for you to come and make your stand
Reach out
Reach out

You now hold the future in your hand

You have come from everywhere across the land
The stars are shining bright
Make it yours tonight

You know every wish you have's at your command
Reach out
Reach out for the medal
. . 
Reach out
Reach out

Now's the time to take hold of your dream

You are standing on the edge of history
So let the games begin
May the best man win

Give your all for all the world to see
Reach out
Reach out for the medal
. . 
Reach out
Reach out for the medal
Reach out
Reach out for the gold
Reach out
Reach out for the medal
Reach out
Reach out for the gold
