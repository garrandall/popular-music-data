Open your hand, I squeeze it tight
I'm putting my trust in you
If you take your time and love me right
There ain't nothing that I won't do

Take me higher and higher
Baby. let's have a ball
(Let's have a ball)
Take me higher and higher
Don't let me fall

Don't drop my love
Don't drop my love
Baby, handle me with care
(Handle me, handle me)
Don't drop my love
Don't drop my love
I'll follow you anywhere
(Anywhere you want now, baby

Heaven knows you're good for me
So I'm letting myself go
In your arms is where I wanna be
Come on and hold me close

Don't you drop
Don't drop my love
Baby, baby don't drop it
Baby, baby now don't drop it

Now don't you drop
Now don't you drop
