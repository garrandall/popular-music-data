Down on me, down on me
Looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me


Love in this world is so hard to find
When you have got yours and I got mine
That is why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me




When you see a hand that's held out toward you
Give it some love, some day it may be you
That is why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me, yeah




Believe in your brother, have faith in man
Help each other, honey, if you can
Because it looks like everybody in this whole round world
Is down on me
