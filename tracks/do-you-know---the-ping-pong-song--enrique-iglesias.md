Do you know 

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.
(Do you know )
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Do you know 
Do ya

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year.
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak

Maybe if I knew all the things that took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see the same about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give.

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know 
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Do you know 
Do ya

How can I love you 
If you just don't talk to me, babe.

Flowing through my head
Is the question "Is she needing
Another side of a man I cannot be?".
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,
I could never see us ending like this.

(Do you know)
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never happened to me.
(Do you know)
But after this episode I don't see,
You can never tell how the next thing life could be

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know 
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Do you know 

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know 
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Do you know 

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away
Do you know 
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed

Do you know 

Do you know what it feels like
(You don't know how it feels)
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away
(You don't know how it feels)
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed

Do you know 
Do ya

Do you know 
Do ya

Do you know 
Do ya
