Hey

And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
Cause I won't take the bait

I'm over here working day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for ya, bae

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
Cause I'm about to put them all away (wooooo)

Ain't no need to hold it back
Go head and talk your shit (heyyy)
I know you're hoping that I'll react
I know you're hoping I'm looking back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is (yeah)

Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
Cause I'm about to put them all away (wooooo)
