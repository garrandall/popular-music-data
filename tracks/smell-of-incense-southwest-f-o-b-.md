She stood as still as shadows of stone
She stood on the edge of my mind
I tried to push her away
I shut and locked the door
Her eyes grew large and asking
And the smell of incense fills her room


She stood in the ever-present fullness
Of expectation
What happened to her childhood dreams?
The sidewalk smothers us tomorrow
And the smell of incense fills her room


And the smell of incense fills her
And the smell of incense fills her
And the smell of incense fills her
And the smell of incense fills her room
