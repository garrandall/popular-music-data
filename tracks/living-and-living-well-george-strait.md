Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

'Til you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
