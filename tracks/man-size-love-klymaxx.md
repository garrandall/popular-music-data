Standing in the shadows
Calling out his name
Waiting for a lover
Who wants to play my game
Baby can't you hear me?
Don't you feel my fire?

I've got more than you can handle
All that you could want
Boy you'll be a winner
If you turn me on
Come and be my lover
Stay with me tonight

I want a man size love
Passion and control of my tenderness
Baby won't you hold me
Show me, can you show me
What a man size love is

Give me a king size kiss
Thrill me with the things
That I understand
Can't you see I need it
Show me you're a man size man

Anytime you're ready
I'll be waiting here
Longing for the magic
Of the night we'll share
Wrap yourself around me
Baby let me know

I've got dreams that I can give you
Arms to hold you tight
Sunshine in the morning
And the stars all night
Once I show you heaven
Boy you'll never let it go

I want a man size love
Passion and control of my tenderness
Baby wont you hold me
Show me, can you show me
What a man size love is

Give me a king size kiss
Thrill me with the things
That I understand
Baby can't you feel it?
You can hold my heart in your hand
Give me a man size man

Man size man

Listen, we'll find a rainbow
Where we'll go
And we'll love the night away
Bring me your action of passion
Before it gets to late

I want a man size love
Passion and control of my tenderness
Baby wont you hold me
Sugar can you show me
What a man size love is

King size kiss
Thrill me with the things
That I understand
Baby can't you feel it?
You can hold my heart in your hand
Give me a man size love

Man size man
Passion and control of my tenderness
Baby wont you hold me
Sugar you can show me
What a man size love is

Give me a king size kiss
Thrill me with the things
That I understand
Baby can't you feel it?
You can hold my heart
