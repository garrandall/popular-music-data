It's no secret that lately there ain't no escaping
That I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm headed on out the door

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened,
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing 'em down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what if's and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing 'em down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
