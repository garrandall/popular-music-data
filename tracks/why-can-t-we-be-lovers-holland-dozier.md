Sometimes I feel like
There's no use in trying
Why can't I face the fact
We've lost, we'll never get back
I don't know where
Where did we go wrong
I say I'm leaving but
My feelings are too strong


And, baby, you know, I'm in love, baby
So in love with you, darling
And I'll never be leaving
No, I'm just make believing
I'm in love, darling
So in love with you, baby
When I say I'm leaving
Girl, I'm just make-believing


Mmm hmm, I ain't going nowhere
No, baby, I ain't going nowhere
Oh, darling, talk to me
My, my, my, my, my


Girl, you're the
Habit I can't break
I'd fall apart if you
Weren't there when I awake
I've said I'm leaving
But I don't have the heart
I can't picture you, baby
You and I being apart


If I say goodbye
It doesn't mean I'm going
And if I say there ain't no love
You may still see it showing
Ooh, ooh, baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, from loving you
I'll never recover


If I say goodbye
It doesn't mean I'm going
And if I say there ain't no love
You may still see it showing


Ooh, ooh, baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, from loving you
I'll never recover
Baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, hey, from loving you
I'll never recover
Cause I'm in love
(I'm in love with you, baby)
So in love
(I'm so in love with you)
And I'll never be leaving
(You know I ain't going nowhere)
I'm just make-believing
(Make believing all the time)
I'm in love
(That's all I ever do)
So in love
(I'm so in love with you)
And I'm make-believing
(Can't take what I say seriously)
When I say I'm leaving
I'm in love, baby (hey, baby)
(Baby) so in love with you, darling
(I love you, don't you understand)
And I'll never be leaving
(I ain't going nowhere)
Girl, I'm just make-believing
(Nowhere)
I'm in love
(I'm so crazy about you)
Ooh, so in love
(This is it for me, mama)
And I'll never be leaving
(I'll never be leaving)
Just make believing
(I love you, you understand)
Just make-believing
(I just make-believe)
I'll never be leaving
(I ain't going nowhere)
Just make-believing
(I just make-believe)
I'll never be leaving
(I ain't going nowhere)
I ain't going nowhere
