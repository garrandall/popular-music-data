I've been lonely too long, I've been lonely too long
In the past it's come and gone, I feel like I can't go on without
Love
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)
As I look back
I can see me lost and searching
Now I find that I can choose, I'm free. Oh, Yeah!
So funny I just have to laugh
All my troubles been torn in half
I been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)
Lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)
In the past it's come and gone
I feel like I can't go on without love
(Lonely), lonely too long
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely)
Just see me now
Makes it worth the time I've waited
She was all I need to make me see, Oh, Yeah!
I keep hopin' with all my mind
Everything gonna turn out right
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long)
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)
Now look at me
Gliding through this world of beauty
Everything I do brings ecstasy, Oh, Yeah!
No wonder I could die
I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high!
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)
Lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)
Found myself somebody. (He's been lonely)
Don't have to be alone no more. (He's been lonely, He's been lonely.)
Don't have to alone no more, no more. (He's been lonely, He's been
Lonely.)
