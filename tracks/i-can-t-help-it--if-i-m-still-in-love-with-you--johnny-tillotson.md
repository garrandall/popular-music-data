Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
The-en suddenly I got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love with you)

(Today I passed you on the street)
SPOKEN: Today I passed you on the street
(And my heart fell at your feet)
SPOKEN: And my heart fell at your feet

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

(Somebody else stood by your side)
SPOKEN: Somebody else stood by your side
(And he looked so satisfied)
SPOKEN: And, ya know, he looked so satisfied

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Oh, it hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold ya just the way I used to do
Oh-oh-oh-oh heaven only knows how much I miss, how much that I miss ya
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

(Still in love with you)
