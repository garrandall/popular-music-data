You see this guy
This guy's in love with you
Really?

Yeah, I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell
We know each other very well
How can I show you
Talk to me baby
I'm glad I got to know you now

I've heard some talk
They say you think I'm fine
Do you really think I'm fine
Yeah, I'm in love
And what I'd do 
To make you mine
Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be 
The last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart 
Keep breaking, 'cause

I want your love
I need your love
Say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die

Please tell me now, is it so?
Right now
Don't let me be the last to know
Oh, my hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause

I need your love
I want your love
I need your love
