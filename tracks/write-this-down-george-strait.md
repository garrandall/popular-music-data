I never saw the end in sight - fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright, but I was running out of time
Cuz you had one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, then darling, here's a final word from me

I love you, and I don't want to lose you
Baby girl, I refuse to let you go away
So Darling

Write this down, take a little note, to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Baby, write this down, read it every day, keep it close by, don't you let it fade away
So you remember what I forgot to say, write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your 'frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel, where you'll see it for sure

(Sure, girl)

I love you, and I don't want to lose you
Baby girl, I refuse to let you go away
So Darling

Write this down, take a little note, to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Baby, write this down, read it every day, keep it close by, don't you let it fade away
So you remember what I forgot to say, write this down

Girl, you're the one I sang my love songs to
The ones that say I'm sad and blue
And I am, when I think of you
And that's about all I do

(Girl do you hear me, I hope that you)

Write this down, take a little note, to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Baby, write this down, read it every day, keep it close by, don't you let it fade away
So you remember what I forgot to say, write this down
