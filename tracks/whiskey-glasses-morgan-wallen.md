Poor me, pour me another drink
Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip it til the pain wears off

Poor me, pour me another round
Line'em up and knock'em down
Two more, let's go
Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before

Don't wanna think about her, or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar, can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong, cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probly makin' out on the couch right now with someone new
Yea I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses

Last call, I swear this'll be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialin' no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender hit me again

Don't wanna think about her, or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar, can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong, cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probly makin' out on the couch right now with someone new
Yea I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
Oh see the world through whiskey glasses, yeah

Line'em up, line'em up, line'em up, line'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock'em back, knock'em back
Fill'em up, fill'em up, fill'em up, fill'em up,
Cause if she ain't ever comin' back

Line'em up, line'em up, line'em up, line'em up
Knock'em back, knock'em back, knock'em back, knock'em back
Fill'em up, fill'em up, fill'em up, fill'em up,
Cause if she ain't ever comin' back

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probly makin' out on the couch right now with someone new
Yea I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
Ohh see the world through whiskey glasses, yeah
See the world through whiskey glasses, yeah
