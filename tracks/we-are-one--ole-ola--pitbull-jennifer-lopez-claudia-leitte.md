Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky) (jogue lÃ¡ no alto)
And wave them side to side (side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Ole, Ole, Ole, Ola 

When the going gets tough
The tough get it going
One love, one life, one world, one fight,
Whole world, one night, one place, Brazil,
Everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel

It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play

Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky) (jogue lÃ¡ no alto)
And wave them side to side (side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Ole, Ole, Ole, Ola 

Jenny, dale!

One night watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Full heart's gonna work so hard
Shoot, fall, the stars
Fists raised up towards the sky
Tonight watch the world unite, world unite, world unite
For the fight, fight, fight, one night
Watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes

Hey, hey, hey
ForÃ§a, forÃ§a come and sing with me,
Hey, hey, hey
Allez, allez come shout aloud with me
Hey, hey, hey
Come on now
Hey, hey, hey
Come on now
Hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky) (jogue lÃ¡ no alto)
And wave them side to side (side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Ole, Ole, Ole, Ola 

Claudia Leitte, obrigado

Ã meu, Ã© seu, hoje Ã© tudo nosso
Quando eu chamo o mundo inteiro pra jogar
Ã pra mostrar que eu posso
Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar
NÃ£o importa o resultado, vamos extravasar

Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky) (jogue lÃ¡ no alto)
And wave them side to side (side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

Ole, Ole, Ole, Ola
