Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more lonliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater
Build me up and I'll fly
Love me now and I'll be glad later
And tell your trouble goodbye

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more lonliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow
Sooner better for you
Fill it up with a happy tomorrow
We got some living to do
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more lonliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Cover me up and I'll squeeze tighter
Honey let's kiss me do
That good good loving makes a bad bad fighter
And I'm not picking on you
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more lonliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more lonliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
