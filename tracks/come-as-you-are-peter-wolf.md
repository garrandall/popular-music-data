They hung a sign out, sign out after seven
Down at the hive where youre such a busy bee
So sign in honey, sign up for heaven
Just you tonight, its you and me

Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and well have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or dont come at all

Therell be a high time, high time after layside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
Well jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me

Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and well have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or dont come at all

Im just a bluebird, bluebird at your window
And if you show, such a pretty sight to see
But like the dawn? I know what youre into
Come its you and me

Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and well have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or dont come at all
