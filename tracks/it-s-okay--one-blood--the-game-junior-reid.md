Dre, I see dead people

Modern vampires of the city
Hunting blood, blood, blood heart

Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood

Yo, Dre, thought I was dead
West Coast

I'm the doctor's advocate
N- Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor

The mavs gon' frop 'em
If 50 ain't rocking' with him nor more
It's ok, I get it poppin'

The whole club rockin' like da 6-4 Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the sh- hydraulics
Then p- in the cup call the sh- Hipnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack, the sh- chronic

And you new n- ain't sh- but new n-
Bathed in ape shoe n- I'm talkin' to you n-
Bounce in the 6-4 throwing up west side man
Sell another five million albums, yes I am

Fresh like damn dis n- did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo', shotgun wit Snoop
What whould the muthaf- west coast be without
One crip and one blood?

One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala
When n- say, "Where you from?"
We'll never say holla
Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side
N- in New York know how to throw up the west side

Word to Eazy, I'm so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you n- better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king and Dre said it the west coast need me

I don't know why you n- keep tryin' me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't got to make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the -?

You thirty-eight and you still rappin'? Uh!
I'm twenty-six nigga, so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out
Nobody guards, when the ch- smoke clear
All you gon' see is one blood

One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

I ain't got beef with 50, no beef wit J
What's beef when you gettin' - in the 6 trey?
And the double game change, I keep 'em on display
Black t-shirt so all you see is the A

Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You n- better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say

N- talk about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
I wait till Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot

I had the number one Billboard spot
N-stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop

One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

One blood, one blood, one blood
Blood, blood, blood
