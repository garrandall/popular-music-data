Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all

I only see you
Maybe once or twice a week
(Once or twice a week)
You make it worth my while
You treat me like a king
(Treat me like a king)

I cherish any time
That I can spend with you
Just say the words
And I'll do anything
But you must be true, oh

Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something, baby)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all

Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something, baby)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
(Oh, oh, baby) of nothing at all

I do not like those guys
Who try to get all they can
(To get all they can)
Cause when it's over
They're right back where they began
(Back where they began)

It's better to have loved
Than never to have loved at all
(To have loved at all)
I'm with you til the water runs uphil

Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something, baby)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all

Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something)
Ten percent of something
(Is better than nothing)

Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
(Than nothing at all)

Ten percent of something
(Now you only see me, baby)
Ten percent of something
(Maybe once or twice a week)

Ten percent of something
(But you treat me, treat me, treat me)
Ten percent of something
(Just like a dog instead of a king)

Ten percent of something (oh, baby)
Ten percent of something (oh, girl)

Just say the word
I'm not like those guys, love
I try, try, try, try allI can, girl

I'm gonna be with you
Be with you til the water runs up hill
Yes, I will, yes, I will, baby

Said I'll cherish, I'll cherish
I swear, my darling
And I'll try my best
To do the best, girl

I need not one
Not two, not three, baby
I need ten percent, ooh...
