Oh oh baby
Immature's back, back, back
Oh oh baby baby, oh oh baby
Romeo, LBD and Bat
You wanna get with me tonight
Oh


Baby, tryin' me, givin' me... all your love
I will never do you wrong
Baby, won't you let down your guard
Then maybe, we can go real far


Oh oh baby
Say you wanna stay the night
You know you got a brother high
I'll come and pick you up in my ride
Oh oh baby baby
Oh oh baby
Say you wanna stay the night
You wanna get with me tonight
I'll come and pick you up in my ride
Oh oh baby baby


Baby, I'll be there to get you, around one
So we can go chill and have some fun
Baby, let's cuddle, 'til the sun comes up

And baby, you know that I love you so much




One, two, three, get down like that
You didn't know? Well understand
We can move from the front to the back
Watch me make you feel like that
Make the moves, you don't like the rules
Take no fools, if that's cool
Romeo, I never lose
With the girls I choose

Immature's back back back
Throw your hands in the sky
Do you think we're tight?
Hey ladies
Do you think we're...
Immature's back, back, back
Throw your hands in the sky
Hey girls
Do you think we're tight?
Oh baby
