Give me all your love now
'Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
'Cause all I hear is
"I'm not ready now"

And I can tell
That you didn't had
To face your mother
Losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
'Cause she didn't had time

I don't want to judge
What's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully
And let's love loud
Let's love now
'Cause soon enough we'll die
