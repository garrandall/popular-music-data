Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out


No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight


Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Oh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out


No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight


(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight
(We got to work this out)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight


No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight


Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well then maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
(Keep it alive, keep it alive)
(Tonight)
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out
