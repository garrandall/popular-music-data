Don't let a lonely Monday come again

Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
Will you be staying after Sunday or go home
Your lips are warm on Friday night
The next two days you hold me tight
But when it's done, you always run, and I'm alone

Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
I'll be waiting for that one day you'll be mine
I'd give the world to keep you here
Why do you need to disappear
And when I press, you do your best, you stall for time

I wouldn't try to own your soul
You can be free
I only want you here each night
Loving me

Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
We gotta let this feeling grow or let it end
You say you care, well if you do
Don't ever go I'm begging you
Don't let a lonely Monday come again

Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
Will you be staying after Sunday or go home on Monday
Will you be staying after Sunday...
