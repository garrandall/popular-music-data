Let me in whee-oh(whee-oohwhee-ohohoop-whee-oh)oh
(Whee-oh whee-oohhoo-ohohp-whee-oh,ohee-oh)oh

I can see the dancin' (let me in)
The silhouettes on the shade
I hear the music (music), all the lovers on parade
Open up (let me in), I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend

Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor
(Lemme in) Let me in!
(Open up) Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? (let me in)

I-uh (open up) hear music let me in (music)
I want to come in again
Let me in (let me in), a-well I heard it just then
I thought you were my friend

(Whee-oh whee-oohhoop-whee-ohoh
(Whee-oh whee-oohhoo-ohohp-whee-oh,ohee-oh)oh

Pitter patter of the fee-ee-ee-ee-eet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor
(Lemme in) Let me in!
(Open up) Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? (let me in)

I-uh-I-uh-I (open up) hear music, let me in (music)
Oh I heard it just then
Let me in (let me in)
I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend

(Whee-oh whee-oohhoop-whee-ohoh
(Whee-oh whee-oohhoo-ohohp-whee-oh)oh
(Hoo-ohoop-whee-oh
(Hoo-ohoop-whee-oh
Fade
(Hoo-ohoop-whee-oh
