The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, ohhhh...


Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary


I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me?
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary


I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I'm just Mary, can't you see that I, I...)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I said, I said I'm just Mary)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary


Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(I wish that they can see that I'm Mary, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Every day of my life I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(And I wish, I wish, I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary


The car i drive, the clothes i wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
Material things don't mean nothing to me
So, I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside


Deep inside I wish that they could see
(I said that I'm just Mary)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Said I wish, and I wish, and I wish, and I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary (MJB, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that you could see

If I could give you something else
But I can't give you nothing but me all day and all night (Mary)
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary


Deep inside I wish that you could see
(It can't be the clothes or the car I drive, 'cause I...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(See the problem is, for many years, I've lived my life publicly...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
