Sitting by the window, feeling sad and blue
All because I haven't heard from you
And then my mama said "Look! Look!
Here comes the postman twistin' down the avenue
He's got a letter in his hand
And I know it has to be for you
He's got the mail sack twisted 'round his back
'Cause he's a (twistin' postman)"

Now he's a-twistin' to the left, twistin' to the right
Twistin' all round and round
If he didn't bring the letter to make me feel better
I was gonna put you down
I'm so glad he came in time to ease this achin' heart of mine
'Cause he's a (twistin' postman)

Mail sack swingin' 'round his back
'Cause he's a
(Twistin' postman)
Uh huh! He's a twistin' postman! Look at him go!
Twistin', twistin'!
He's got the mail sack twisted 'round his back
'Cause he's a (twistin' postman)

Twistin' to the left, twistin' to the right
Twistin' all round and round
If he didn't bring the letter to make me feel better
I was gonna put you down
I'm so glad he came in time to ease this achin' heart of mine
'Cause he's a (twistin' postman)

Look! Look! Here comes the mailman twistin' down the avenue
He's got a letter in his hand and I know it has to be for you
