Stacy, my eyes have seen
The child before
Ain't a child no more
I'm seeing you
In such a different way
Oh tell me now
That you'll stay

I've got to know if my feelings are right
I've seen the fire in you burning so bright
Oh I swear I believe you'd make a blind man see
Stacy

Stacy, oh mystery
Heaven made a rose
From the streets below
You've taken me
Above the city lights, yeah
The words you spoke
Gave me wings to fly

You took a stranger from out of the rain
I know I'll never again be the same
From out of a dream you made it real for me
Stacy

Yes and now I'm turnin' myself to face me
I'm running a race that can't be won
On my own
And I think that you know

Stacy, I can't believe
This heart of stone
In your arms so warm
A step in time
Yeah, we'll turn it all around
You can count on me
When you're feeling down

There's not a wrong can't be made into right
You and I we are one of a kind
Like an island at sea you came and rescue me
Stacy

You took a stranger from out of the rain
I know I'll never again be the same
From out of a dream you made it real for me
Stacy

Oh I swear I believe you'd make a blind man see
Stacy
