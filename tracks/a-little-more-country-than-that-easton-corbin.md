Imagine a dirt road
Full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles
Catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that

Picture a small town
With an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that

I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that

Think of a Hank song
From days gone
With a steel ride that's so strong
It sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that

If you want a brick home
In a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that

I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that

Yea I'm sure that you've heard those three words from others but they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back
I'm a little more country than that

I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that
