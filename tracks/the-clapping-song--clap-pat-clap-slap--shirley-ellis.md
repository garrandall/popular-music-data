Three, six, nine, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
They all went to heaven in a little row-boat

Clap-Pat
Clap-Pat
Clap-Pat
Clap-Slap

Clap-Pat: Clap your hand, pat it on your partner's hand (right hand)
Clap-Pat: Clap your hand, cross it with your left arm, pat your partner's left palm
Clap-Pat: Clap your hand, pat your partner's right palm with your right palm again
Clap-Slap: Clap your hands, slap your thighs, and sing a little song; go:

My mother told me
If I was good-ee
That she would buy me
A rubber dolly

My aunty told her
I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me
A rubber dolly

Three, six, nine, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
They all went to heaven in a little row-boat

Clap-clap: Clap you hands and prepare to pat
Pat: Take your right arm pat your partner's right palm with your right palm
Clap: Take your hands back and clap

Pat: Take you right arm cross your right arm with your left arm pat your partner's left palm with your left palm
Clap: Take your hands back and clap
Pat: Take your right arm cros your left arm and pat your partner's right palm with your right palm
Clap: Now back, with a clap
Take the flats of your palms and slap your thighs and watch the fun materialize as you sing this little song

My mother told me
If I was good-ee
That she would buy me
A rubber dolly

My aunty told her
I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me
A rubber dolly

Clap pat
Clap pat
Clap pat
Clap slap

Clap pat
Clap pat
Clap pat
Clap slap
