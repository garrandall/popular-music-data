Tell me woman
Who you're with tonight
If you're on your own
That's allright
But if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive

Do you have a place
Where we could go?
Or does your mother
Want you home?
Don't waste my time
I don't have long
It's hard to find a woman
When you know you'll soon be gone

So break the rules
And tell me "yes"
I'll prove to you
That love is best
But if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive

In this big city
I'm high and dry-
I just can't make out
Though I try
So if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive
