May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment


I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee (scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee


I'm so complete anymore

Guess what, baby? I feel freeee
And you know damn well

He lift me up every time that I fell
And set me freeee, yeah

Ah! You should quit your job to this

Hold up, that'll politic, ooh
One day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "fuck you"
I could never trustâ


Freeee, I feel freeee
I feel freeee, I feel freeee


I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am freeee
Yeah, nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am freeee

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feelin' out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm freeee

I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am freeee


I feel freeee, I feel freeee
I feel freeee, I feel freeee
