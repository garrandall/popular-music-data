Mucho gusto
Aye que fabulosa
Rae aye, aye, aye

Arriba
Quieres bailar
Mirame

I believe in dreaming
And shooting for the stars
Baby to be number one
You got to raise the bar

Kicking and a scratching
Grinding out my best
Anything it takes to climb
The ladder of success

Work our tails off everyday
Gotta bump the competition
Blow them all away

Caliente
Suave
Yeah, we're gonna

Bop bop bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop
Hop until we drop
And start again

Zip zap zop hop, flop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove
Until the music stops

Do the bop bop bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme gimme
Shimmy shimmy

Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle
Do the hustle
Yeah, we're gonna

Bop bop bop, bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump stump stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff

Bop bop bop, straight to the top
We're going for the glory
We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop, stop

Till we reach the top
Bop to the top
