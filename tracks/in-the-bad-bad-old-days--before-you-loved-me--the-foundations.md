Ha, hah
Alright

In those bad, bad old days
Before you loved me girl (loved me girl)
I was just a lonely man
In so many ways
Till you loved me girl (loved me girl)
And I was your only man

You came into my life
And ended misery
In those bad, bad old days
That used to be

Everyday I slave to pull us through
But one day I'm gonna make it girl I'm telling you
The sun goes down around home every night
To see your smiling face and hold you tight

I know that you'll be waitin' there for me
But I can still recall what used to be, yeah

In those bad, bad old days
Before you loved me girl (loved me girl)
I was just a lonely man
In so many ways
Till you loved me girl (loved me girl)
And I was your only man

You came into my life
And ended misery
In those bad, bad old days
That used to be

I shake a living out of this old world
But I'll give you everything, believe me girl
I'm gonna really make it, to the top
And nothing in this world is gonna, make me stop

You sure put a magic spell on me
I'm nothing like the man I used to be, yeah

I still remember (still remember)
Just last September (last September)

In those bad, bad old days
Before you loved me girl (loved me girl)
I was just a lonely man
In so many ways
Till you loved me girl (loved me girl)
And I was your only man

You came into my life
And ended misery
In those bad, bad old days
In those sad sad old days
In those bad bad old days
That used to be

In those bad bad old days
(Thank you baby, thank you, baby, yeah)
Before you loved me girl, loved me girl
(Thank you very much)
I was just a lonely man
(I'll give you the world, yeah)
In so many ways till you loved me girl
(Thank you honey)
(Thank you, thank you baby, yeah, now)
La, la, la, la....
