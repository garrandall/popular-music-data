Feel good tonight
I feel good because I believe that some young man or some young girl out there
Will listen to me
I've been lucky
But most of all, I was dedicated to something I believe
I believe that if a man, if a man will live as long as he can and die when he can't help himself, he will succeed
I believe when a man has an undying determination
That he can make it if he try
So drugs got you down
Let me tell you this other part
Let me tell you this other part
Let me tell you the power they possessed
Power in the north, east, south, and west
I bet I'll hip you to more things you can do
The women that it turned around and the men that it slew
In Channel, it stopped an army
In France, it ran
It's armin' in Turkey
And believe me, they respect it in Tokyo and Japan
It hooks whole countries and had them enslaved
It take his honors and made them degrade
It makes addicts go out and steal
Take that which is not yours, go out and steal
Make hungry dope friend miss a meal
Now, anything that won't let a man eat, can't be too sweet
To salaam, to salaam, peace be unto you, As-Salaam-Alaikum, brother
To some, it's a solution - to others, it's a must
It'll make their soul grow heavy with lust
It'll make a man troubled
It will make a man in trouble rat on his friend
There's a reckless few, you understand me?
It'll make a man rat on his friend
Do you hear me? Use more
It exterminate, it exterminate
There's a regular few that use more than most
It'll exterminate them with a quick overdose - we call it an O.D
It'll make them shabby
Cats that used to dress on the corner be clean to the bone
Clean to the bone, never see 'em alone
All the time they got somethin' bad with 'em
Walking down the street with their main squeeze
It'll make them dress shabby when they used to dress neat
And all that use it, it'll make him weak
If you're ruthless, it'll make you ruthless, heartless, and don't give a damn
For the weak ones are always caught in a jam
Give it up, brother, give it up
I see the whole world around me
I see men falling by the wayside
I kids that are going to school
That mothers and dads struck up goals and sent 'em to school
And now they're bums on the corner
But let me tell ya, you don't have to be a bum
Take that will and get up, get up, get up, don't stand there
Get up, yeah, be a man, get up
Get up, get up, get up
You're too much woman to stand there
And you're too much man to make her stand there and wait on you
If you get up, man, she'll follow you
Get on up and walk away
Get up, get up, get up
