I know that someday
You'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else

You expect me to be true
And keep on loving you
Though I'm feeling blue
You think I can't forget you

Until someday
You'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new

Although you don't want me now
Oh, but I'll get along somehow
And then I won't
No, I won't want you

Someday, you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
Although you don't want me now
Oh, but I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
