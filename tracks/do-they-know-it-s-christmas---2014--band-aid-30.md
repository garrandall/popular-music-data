It’s Christmas time and there’s no need to be afraid
At Christmas time we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time


But say a prayer, and pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it’s hard but while you’re having fun
There’s a world outside your window and it’s a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you



Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight
Where to comfort is to fear
Why is touch is to be scared
How can they know it’s Christmas time at all


Here’s to you
Raise a glass to everyone
And here’s to them
And all their years to come
How can they know it’s Christmas time at all


Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world
