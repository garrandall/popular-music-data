My momma said to me
Do you really love that guy?
Does he ever make you cry?

Rain falling from the sky
Bluebirds
They don't fly
The stars, they're not so bright
The moon caved in at night
It seems the whole world dies
Whenever a teenager cries
(When she cries)

Tears for the one you love
Were sent to heaven above
In hopes they'd be some day
True love will come your way
Our tears will fill my eyes
Whenever a teenager cries

Oh what wrong have I done to you
To make me cry the way that I do
I need you my darling
I love you so
Oh come back to me
And I'll never let you go

Rain falling from the sky
Bluebirds, they don't fly
The stars
They're not so bright
The moon caved in at night

It seems the whole world dies
Whenever a teenager cries
(When she cries)
Whenever a teenager cries
(When she cries)
Whenever a teenager cries
