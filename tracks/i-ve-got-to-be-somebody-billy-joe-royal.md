I never had any reason
For ambition or drive
In fact, I never anybody
That cared if I'm alive

But then one day she came my way
And I heard a voice within me say don't let her get away whatever you do
But I never thought that this could be
That she would ever look at me
Seriously

And that's why, oh Lord, Lord, Lord
I got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me

I grew upon the sidewalks
Got along the best I could
Mama worked all day long
And papa was no good

I never asked for much before
But here I am at Heaven's door
So help me please
Don't let her pass me by

Cause I would rather die than see
Her love turn into sympathy
For me

And that's why I'm, oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
I got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me

Mmm
Got to be somebody

Got to be a somebody
So tired of being a nobody

Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
I got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me
