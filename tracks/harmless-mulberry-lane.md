I apologize (baby)
I couldn't describe how I hurt inside
So I take it out on you

I think we're both to blame
We storm like thunder and we pound like rain
Just like we always do

You say you've had enough, the water is rough
The river between us is raging higher than ever before
I know you're having doubts, but we can work it out
If you wrap your love around me
'Cause I don't want to fight anymore

You've got to believe, I'm begging you please
Hold me harmless tonight
I know I was wrong, you've got to be strong
Hold me harmless tonight

Tomorrow's gonna come
And after all is said and done
We still won't get along

It's really no surprise
You have your days and I have mine
But still we're holding on

I pace across the floor, your hand is on the door
The tension between us is raging higher than ever before
But baby turn around, don't make another sound
Just wrap your love around me
'Cause I don't want to fight anymore

You've got to believe, I'm begging you please
Hold me harmless tonight
I know I was wrong, you've got to be strong
Hold me harmless tonight
'Cause there's a moon up above, it sure feels like love
Hold me harmless tonight

Here we are, closer to the end than the beginning
But don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end

You've got to believe in love, be strong in love, hold on
You've got to believe in love, be strong in love, hold on

You've got to believe, I'm begging you please
Hold me harmless tonight
'Cause there's a moon up above, it sure feels like love
Hold me harmless tonight
