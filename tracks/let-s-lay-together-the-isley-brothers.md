Spanish Intro

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice tonight
(Together)

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice


Girl, do you know who you're steppin' to
Do you know the things I can do for you
I'm Mr. Biggs, I'll keep you jiggs
Give you cash, money, rubys, emeralds, diamonds honey
In a minute, I'll be in it
Hit it from the top, from the bottom, from the side
Open wide, let me slide
You can run but baby, you can't hide

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice tonight
(Together)

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice

This is where you oughtta be
Lying here touchin' you, you're stroakin' me
Keep it hot, show me what you got
Just like that, hit it back to back
(From the back)

In a minute I'll be in it
On the bed, on the couch, on the chair
On the floor, everywhere
Open up and I'll go there, yeah

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice tonight
(Together)

 Could you love me (Papi)
Baby, I'm beggin'
Baby, I'm beggin', beggin' baby (Papi)
 My body's calling for you, yeah
 Baby I'm beggin'
Baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby (Papi)
 My body's calling for you, yeah

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice tonight
(Together)

(Papi) Could you love me tonight
On a warm summer's night
It would be so nice
