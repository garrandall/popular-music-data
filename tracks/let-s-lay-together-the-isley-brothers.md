La da da da da da da da da da, hey yeah, oh


Your body's warm, but you're still unsure
I'll have you know that I have the perfect cure, yeah
Step in my room and I'll take your fears away
Put your trust in me and all that I say
Tell me can we lay


Let's lay together
Oh hoo baby
Let's lay together
Tell me can we lay
Let's lay together
Lay ay ay ay, yeah, oh baby
Let's lay together
Oh, oh hoo oh hoo


Heaven's to blame for this love affair
Feels good to know love will always be there, baby
You took my heart and made such a sexual burning flame
Let's love tonight, straight into the day
Can we lay


Let's lay together
Please baby
Let's lay together
Oh, all I wanna do is lay
Let's lay together
Let's lay together
Let's lay together
Let's lay together


Ah, please, baby
Lay down, baby
Let me help you with your stockings, girl
Yeah, oh baby
All I wanna do, all day and night, all day and night, baby
Oh, oh, oh


Let's lay together
Can we lay? Can we lay? What can I say? Can we lay?
Let's lay together
Ah, together, me and you, me and you, me and you, girl
Let's lay together
Me and you, girl, ah, nobody
Let's lay together
Nobody else, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody else around
Let's lay together
Nobody, baby - we can go to town
Let's lay together


Yeah, well well well, I can make your body sing, baby
Ting a ling a ling, ting a ling, ting a ling, baby
Well well well well, ohhoo hoo hoo
Can we lay? Can we lay?
Let's lay together
Can we lay? Can we lay, baby?
Let's lay together
Ah, ah, put your head on my shoulder, baby
Let's lay together
Right there, right there, girl
