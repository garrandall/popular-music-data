It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
But parked in her rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red Super-Stock Dodge

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
You might try a goer but you'll never lose her
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
She's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length then she'll shut 'em down

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go

Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
