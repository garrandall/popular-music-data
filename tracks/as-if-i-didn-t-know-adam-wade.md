You swore to me
You were my one and only
Though deep inside
I knew it wasn't true

Since you've been gone
My days are cold and lonely
I just can't seem
To want somebody new

As if I didn't know
That you were lying
And that your game of love
Would cause me woe

In spite of all the times
You left me crying
I played your game
As if I didn't know

They warned me that someday
I'd learn a lesson
And that a broken heart
Would be the cause

Believe me when I say
That I'm confessing
I'm glad I loved you
Even though I lost

As if I didn't know
Someday you'd hurt me
As if I couldn't tell
You'd grieve me so

And even though it's true
You did desert me
I still love you
As if I didn't know

I still love you
As if I didn't know
