Woman tell me, where did you learn
To handle a man with so much ease?
After all of his life
He's used to doing like he pleased, yeah

You got me doing all the good things
That a man's supposed to do
I know a lot of men who wish they had
A sweet little woman like you
'Cause your kind is so hard to find

Woman tell me, where did you learn
To make a man feel like a king?
When all the time he knows
That he hasn't got a thing, yeah

Stand by my side, baby
And there's no limit to what I can do
I know some men who'd give their right arm
To have a sweet little woman like you
Because your kind is so hard to find

Your kind is so hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
And that's why I'm so glad that I got mine

Woman tell me, what do I have to do
To make you really see
Just how much I really love you
And how much you mean to me? Yeah

Don't be afraid to tell me baby
'Cause there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I know a lot of men that wish they had
A sweet little woman like you
'Cause your kind is so hard to find

A sweet woman like you is hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
A sweet woman like you is so hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
A sweet woman like you is hard to find
