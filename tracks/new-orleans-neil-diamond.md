I said, Hey Hey Hey, Hey Ya
I said, Hey, Hey Ya Ya

Well come on everybody
Make a trip with me
Down from Mississippi
Down to New Orleans
They got the honeysuckle
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine
Love is bloomin' there all the time
Down from Mississippi
Down to New Orleans

You know that any Southern Belle
Is a Mississippi Queen

Hey Hey Hey Hey Ya
Hey Hey Ya Ya

Well come on everybody
Take a stroll with me
We gonna listen to the music
With a Dixieland beat.
They got the magnolia blossoms fill the air.
If you ain't been to heaven
You ain't been here
Now all the French moss hangin'
From a big oak tree.
Down from Mississippi
Down to New Orleans.

Hey Hey Hey Hey Ya
Hey Hey Ya Ya

Well let's go everybody
Take a trip with me.
Down from Mississippi
Down to New Orleans.
They got the honeysuckle
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine.
They got love bloomin' there all the time.
You know that any Southern Belle
Is a Mississippi Queen.
Down from Mississippi
Down to New Orleans.

Well ,come on,
You got it
We gonna dance, going to New Orleans.
That's the place
I said, come on
Come on, come on, come on
