Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady

Hey sexy lady
Said I like the way
You move your thang
Lord, have mercy, girl

You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl you ought to be on TV on Soul Train

When you get the groove
It ain't no stopping
Just can't help it
But I'm, I'm finger pop-ping

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady

Shake it baby, shake it
Baby, shake your thang
Shake it baby, shake it
Baby, shake your thang

You got me grooving
I feel like moving
You got me loving
Can't sit still
I'm grooving
I like that funky stuff

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Shove it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady

Hey sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl, you're driving me out of my mind

If it wasn't for the girl
Sitting next to me
I'd jump right up and out-ta my safety seat

You got me hypnotized
Soul mesmo-ized
Girl, you're moving me
Girl, you're groovin' me

Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it

Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in and about, disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in and about, disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
