I want to be your lover
But your friend is all I've stayed
I'm only halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away

I long for your lips to kiss my lips
But just when I think they may
You lead me halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away

Being close to you is almost heaven
But seeing you can do just so much
It hurts me so to know your heart's a treasure
And that my heart is forbidden to touch

So put your sweet lips close to my lips
And tell me that's where they're gonna stay
Don't lead me halfway to paradise

So near, yet so far away (Repeat and fade out)
