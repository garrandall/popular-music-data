I see you passing by everynight,
You're my day glow fantasy.
Your skinny jeans are fitting oh so right,
Just like you were made for me.


I'll hold you close,
Won't let you go.
Girl, I'm bringing back romance.
I've got a coat,
If you get cold.
All I need is half a chance


To be that guy-uy-uy right next to you,
I'm your Mr. Right,
Make me that guy-uy-uy,
No one else will do
Cause when you're by my side,
My heart goes, woah-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa.
How can you deny?
You can say what you wanna say,
But Baby, I'm your guy.


I saw you shopping in the corner spot,
So I walked right down your aisle.
We conversated about the raindrops,
And I finally made you smile.


I said, "Let's go!"
She said, "I dont know?"
I guess she don't know how to dance.
How about a date?
This saturday?
AlI need is half a chance.


To be that guy-uy-uy right next to you,
I'm your Mr. Right,
Make me that guy-uy-uy,
No one else will do
Cause when you're by my side,
My heart goes, woah-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa.
How can you deny?
You can say what you wanna say,
But Baby, I'm your guy.


Shawty, you're a dime. 
Everything about you is just so divine. 
I just wanted to let you know, 
That I'm your guy.


let's be like that song on the radio 
-song on the radio-


To be that guy-uy-uy right next to you,
I'm your Mr. Right,
Make me that guy-uy-uy,
No one else will do
Cause when you're by my side,
My heart goes, woah-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa.
How can you deny?
You can say what you wanna say,
But Baby, I'm your guy.
