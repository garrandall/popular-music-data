I see him everyday
He pass my way
What can I do?
Oh oh what a guy oh oh what a guy
What a guy he's sweet and gentle
What a guy he's sentimental
What a guy

Oh oh here he comes again
His smile is?
Should I smile too
Oh oh what a guy oh oh what a guy
What a guy his hair is wavy
What a guy he drives me crazy
What a guy
I want to tell him (that I love him)
Yeah that I really really I love him oh yeah
Tell him that I really care
Give him all my love to share
Want him so much I could die.
Yeah, yeah, yeah what a guy
Oh oh what a guy
What a guy he's sweet and gentle
What a guy he's sentimental
What a guy
