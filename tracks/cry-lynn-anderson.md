If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye it's no secret you feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotions that you feel
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky
So let your head down and go on and cry
If your heartaches seem to...
Oh let your head down and go on and cry
