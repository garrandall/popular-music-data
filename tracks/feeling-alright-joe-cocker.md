Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
For someone's locked the door and took the key

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself

Boy you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
That when I think of you
I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time
I must keep trying
I've got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself

Don't you get too lost in all I say
But at the time you know, I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get set so I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name oh and a different face

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
