Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losin' mine

I was losin' my mind, on the Mississippi Queen

Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything

Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer. she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

I was gettin' mine
I was gettin' mine

No, you can't have mine
No no, you can't have mine
To keep a mississippi queen
