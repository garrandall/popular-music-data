Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh


When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look


Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)


Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Oh, oh baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na


Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now


Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh


A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need


Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
I want you back


Forget what happened then
I want you back


Let me live again


Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back


Spare me of this cause


Gimme back what I lost


Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
Oh! Oh! Oh! I want you back!
