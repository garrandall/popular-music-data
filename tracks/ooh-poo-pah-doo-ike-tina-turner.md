I wanna tell you bout ooh poo pah doo
Baby, call me the most
Ooh poo pah do, yeah
Baby call me the most
And I won't stop tryin'
Till I create some disturbance in your mind

Gonna ring a few bells in your ear
Ring a few bells, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ring a few bells in your ear
Ain't gon stop tryin'
Till I create some disturbance in your mind

And I ain't gon stop tryin'
Till I create some disturbance in your mind

Until I create some disturbance in your mind
Your mind, your mind...
