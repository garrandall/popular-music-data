I'm up in Oakland on a Saturday night
Lord, I said I just didn't feel right
Goodnight ladies all around
But the right one hadn't found me such a bad night
I didn't feel right

Then a friend came over 'fore it got too late
Asked me if I'd like you a s double date
My stars above, I fell in love

With queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Yeah, the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

Now Queenie's a lady, she's quite a child
Oh, she'll make you feel fine
Remember the when a trucker from Dallas
Was callous to Queenie with his rude side

Now he can't deny, that he gotten much  more than he bargained for
Queenie's right cross run him to the floor
Now he knows better than to mess

With the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
The queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

Oh, as fast as a bullet she can jam all night
Makes a full grown wonder bull die with fright
When we get home alone in love
She murmurs like a sweet moaning dove, oh

Oh, such a lady, she's quite a child
She'll make me feel good in this heart of mine
She's my love, she's a lady

She's the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Ah, the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

I'm talking about the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Yeah, she's the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)

O queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
The queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Oh
