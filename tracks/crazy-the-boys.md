1-900-909-BOYS (Yeah!)
Girl, when you gon' dial my heart?
Watch out!

I've been sitting here
Trying to figure out
How she does it to me
I don't understand how
She takes her man and changes his personality

She rocks it to the East
She rocks it to the West
I need some time
Cause my head is such a mess

I know
She's crazy 'bout me too
It's ridiculous, baby
I don't know what to do

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby

Check it out
Okay
What's ups with the Young Einstein posse?
Talkin' about a girl that's
Funky
Can't you see?
She's got me going
Showing the moves
I've never been shown
She's got us all whipped
Even my little brother

(Yo, word to your mother)
You know what?
When she's around
I feel shaky
Yo, she got us all going crazy

I'm a different man
Doing the best I can
Keeping my sanity
You know, babe
She knows the way I feel for her
Word to my mother

She rocks me to the East
She rocks me to the West
Slow down, baby
I got pains in my chest
(I'm having a heart attack)

Don't fight this feeling
You know you want me too
Don't play games with me, baby
I ain't got time to lose
Sing

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby

Rocks me out of my mind

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby

Yo, Keem
Take it to the bridge

Follow me
We can walk
We can talk
On this bridge
Bridge of love
On this bridge of love
We can work it out

Crazy for your love
Crazy for you
Crazy for your love
Crazy for you

Hoo, I'm crazy
Ho, I'm crazy
Ho, I'm crazy
Crazy
Crazy, baby

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby

Going out of my mind
You've got me going crazy
Stop wasting my time
Crazy
Crazy

I've been going crazy
Since you came in my life
You've got me going crazy
Why can't you see what you do to me?

Crazy, baby
I can't eat
Can't sleep
Tell me what could it be?
Crazy for your love
Crazy for you

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby

You really got me going

You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
You've got me going
Crazy
Crazy, baby
