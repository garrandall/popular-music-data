You can see it from the river
To the top of white pine ridge
Burning like a summer sun
A bunch of rednecks getting half lit
There's mud-covered trucks and suvs
Cranking out hank and ac/dc


At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig,
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

Everybody sees the headlights
When old Sheriff John pulled up
We all got a little nervous
It's too late to hide our cups
He pops a top and hollers real loud
Dont worry yall I came to hang out



You don't have to be from around here
To know right where to go
All you gotta do is load up
And head towards glow



At the bonfire
Were all hanging at the bonfire
