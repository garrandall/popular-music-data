Sun is up
Day is on
Look for me
I'll be gone
Cause today's the day
I'm gonna see him again

He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so

Once he stopped
And talked to me
I found out
How dreams can be
With a big wide smile
And a big white hat

He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so

Sun is up
Day is on
Look for me
I'll be gone
Cause today's the day
I'm gonna see him again

He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl
Who loves him so
