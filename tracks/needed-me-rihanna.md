Mustard on the beat, ho!


I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you


But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it


You needed me
Oh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby oh you needed me


You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya


But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it


You needed me
Oh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby oh you needed me
