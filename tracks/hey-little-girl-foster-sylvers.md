Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, but I'd like to know you better
Just a-swingin' your books and chewin' gum
Lookin' just like a juicy plum
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl

Hey, little girl in the black silk stockin's
Gee, but you got my heart rockin'
A-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt
And that crazy Ivy Leauge shirt
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey little girl

Hey, little girl, can I come along?
Carry your books, and a-hold your arm?
I'm hopin' that you'll tell me yes,
Because you're the girl that I love best
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, mm-mm

Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, I hope you're feelin' better
Not just like the time before,
'Member when you closed that door?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl

Hey!, little girl
Hey, hey, hey, little girl
Mm-mm
