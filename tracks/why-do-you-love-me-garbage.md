I'm no Barbie doll
I'm not your baby girl
I've done ugly things
And I have made mistakes


And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed
So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?
Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud


Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?


You're not some little boy
Why you acting so surprised?
You're sick of all the rules
Well, I'm sick of all your lies


Now I've held back a wealth of shit, I think I'm gonna choke
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good?
Nothing ever came from nothing, man
Oh man, ain't that the truth


Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?


I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it, I do it again


I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine
I have no proof but I think that I'm right
And you've still got the most beautiful face
It just makes me sad most of the time


I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it
I do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again


Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy


Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
