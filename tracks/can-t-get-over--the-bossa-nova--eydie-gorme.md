Can't get over Bossa Nova
That Brazilian beat sure moves my feet
It's so simple
That it's simply you and me

Besides the coffee
They brought with them
A percolating kind of rhythm
That moves this whole town
Upside down
Manhattan's gone Latin

One Note Samba and La Bamba
And the Girl from Ipanema seems
Bossa Nova's taking over
Bravo Desafinado

So I'll stay with
Night and day with
And if you do agree
Won't you come and
Bossa Nova with me

Besides the coffee
They brought with them
A percolating kind of rhythm
That moves this whole town
Upside down
Manhattan's gone Latin

One Note Samba and La Bamba
And the Girl from Ipanema seems
Bossa Nova's taking over
Bravo Desafinado

So I'll stay with
Night and day with
And if you do agree
Won't you come and
Bossa Nova with me

If you come and Bossa Nova
I'll be happy to move over
If you come and Bossa Nova with me

If you come and Bossa Nova
I'll be happy to move over
If you come and Bossa Nova with me
