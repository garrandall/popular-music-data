Winter's almost gone
Oh how I've waited so long
For summer nights
When there's magic in the air
And I don't have a care
All that matters to me
Is that you are here
On summer nights

There's a little café
Where we can hear music play
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go
There you'll hold me tight and say
Our love will always be this way
On summer nights

At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand
On summer nights

In our little café
We'll dance the night away
And we know our love will be
Always true eternally

And when the moon begins to shine
I can see that you are mine
On summer nights

On summer nights
On summer nights
