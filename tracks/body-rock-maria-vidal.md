Born on a hungry street
Children of darkness grew upon the beat
Anything in our way
We'll just move away

I've got the heart to win
You got the eyes that say that I can
We're gonna turn this town
Upside down tonight

They can't stop us now

Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock
Comes from deep inside you
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight

We come from underground
Oh stickin' together gonna turn the world around
Runnin' through the neon night
With a dream inside

This feels like something new
Heartbeats, your heartbeat comin' straight at you
We've got the moment now
Once we're on the move

They can't hold us now

Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock
Comes from deep inside you
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight

Body rock
Means you do it like you feel it
Body shot
Turns the beat electric
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
