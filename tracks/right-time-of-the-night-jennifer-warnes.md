Sun goes down on a silky day
Quarter moon walking through the Milky Way
Oh, you and me, baby
We could think of something to do

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love

No use talking when the shadows fall
Nightbird's calling and he says it all
Oh, you and me, baby
We could think of something to do

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love

I got you and you got me
Tell you, that's the way my mama always said it should be
I'll be cruel, you'll be kind
We'll be bad, if you don't mind

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love
