In paradise

I've got a feeling that something is wrong
That look is telling me you're not happy
We never listen to our favorite songs
Do you remember the way you held me?

No, I won't let you work this love away
There was a time when you held me tight
Dreams of now and dreams of yesterday
Both have the heartache that you feel inside

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise

So many times I look into your eyes
I see an image, a man who's crying
You try to tell me, but I realize
It's had to make it, we'll keep on trying

Open up your heart, let's get away
Just take my hand, it will be alright
Leave all behind, come out and play
We'll find the answer deep into the night

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise

Memories of you and me
The many in love
Tell me I'll always be
In paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive

You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise
