Beyond the ocean
A lighthouse is waiting for me
The Great Chain in motion
Beneath the waves of the sea
Into the city
All good things flow
The sweat on your brow
Is what you reap and sow
Forge your own fortune
From salt and from sand
No gods or kings
Only man

Folks told me, son, you won the gene pool
So I guess I had a head start on these fools
Doesn't take a Winter Blast for Jack to keep cool
But isolation in the deep blue can be cruel
I descended the depths fathom by fathom
As if the ocean opened up and I've been cast in a chasm
Upon a sweeping seascape where genetic accidents happen
But don't blame EVE, the cause of the fall had to be ADAM
If you believe the sweat of your brow oughtta be yours
Listen to Andrew Ryan, the philosophical entrepreneur
He might've put me on blast, but I'll get past his thugs
I asked who Fontaine was, and Atlas Shrugged
Welcome to Rapture, where we sell, manufacture
Evolution: natural selection's happening faster
Were you shocked when I said I was nothing less than electric?
This city's dead but I bet that I can resurrect it
Like a Lazarus Vector, giving breath to the breathless
I will never let a single engine rest in Hephaestus
Yeah, I'm getting more dependent on medkits
My doctor's got sick demented obsessions
For promising pretty, you could lesson perfection
Remember, ugliness is an aggressive infection
Forget the Hippocratic Oath, that has been neglected
No wonder this operation has become so gut-wrenchin'
I better collect every weapon and any effective invention
To make 'em vanish like Houdini
Pumpin' lead in these Leadheads
I call it artwork, want it censored? Forget it
I got a killer's disposition, guess it's genetic
If death is a choice, then I reject it!

Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise
RISE

Roll up my sleeves, so blood will not get on 'em
These shackles remind me I started from the bottom
I was just a little fish who hadn't had his cherry popped
Now I'm a grown man, damnit, I ain't scared of shots
Shots shots shots shots now my veins are on fire
Rearrangin' DNA? Sounds like playing with fire
When sciences are practiced with a lack of moral guidance
Splicers seek to satisfy their sick sadistic vices
Victims become villains, angry vandals turn to violence
Sickly children sticking by their less than gentle giants
Minds manipulated by the parasite inside 'em
But if you're a parasite in Ryan's eyes, you're put to silence
The great and strong will not yield to the weak and feeble
You'll need cerebral upgrades to see me as your equal
Harvest ADAM, feed on EVE, it doesn't make me evil
Because my survival rides on getting Power to the People
Plenty of desperate denizens deal with deprivation
But let's be fair, laissez-faire, forget the regulations
This economy- perfectly working without you
So let me fill my craving at the Circus of Values
Drawn here, like a moth to a flame
Fallin' from grace, swallowed by a watery grave
Now I frolic on the stage, like a part in a play
As if I was nothing but a puppet, just a pawn in the game
Lookin' for something to set me apart from a slave

Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise
RISE

Rapture is bleeding through cracks that are leaking
Dwindling memories tell secrets they're keeping
Demons disguised by benign masquerades
Angels climb out of their graves

Mind over matter is the practice I'm preachin'
How else could I achieve feats of telekinesis?
If you're a lousy hack, I'll get past your defense
And if you try to whack me, you'll kick the hornet nest
Get out of my Gatherer's Garden because the harvest is over
You know, when it comes to tonics, I don't wanna be sober
Now I got a slimmer waist
And my chin is chiseled more
Can't you see? Vanity sent the city into civil war
In a utopia, who's gonna wanna scrub the toilets?
The people in Apollo Square got no other choices
I know how this is gonna end, but I don't wanna spoil it
Before I let you seize my city, I'm gonna destroy it!
So just relax, Big Daddy, I command ya
Strike a pose, smile for the camera
I think objectively, just like Ayn Rand does
Attention: will the real Fontaine stand up?
A man chooses, unlike a slave
Who never strays from the path that his master paves
Follows every order and does everything they say
Now Would You Kindly... OBEY?
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY
OBEY

Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise

My city is thriving
Your allies- choose them wisely
Our Rapture is rising
Stand with us, Would You Kindly?
RISE

Welcome to the Circus of Values
You'll find no better vending service around you
We've got everything that you'll ever need
Don't be shy, come on by, you've got a craving to feed

Go home - if you can't afford, don't buy it!
