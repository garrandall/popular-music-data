There's a photographer that's gonna be taking pictures of us together
To prove that you were here doing, uh, the record
Yeah, in case people don't believe us
How come he's not wearing a toque?
Oh, he's not from the Great White North


Okay, so if you'd like to, uh, put on a toque and some headphones
We can do the hit single now, okay?
Sure, that'd be great
