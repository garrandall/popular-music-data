Wow
I'm beautiful
Or so you tell me so
You say I've got the body
That you just love to hold

It's so seldom
People tell you what you wanna hear
It's so rare
That your adventure overcomes your fear
Oh

Wow
That feels good
When you touch me there
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)

No one's done it quite like that
Maybe no one really cared
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)

So baby
When I say I burn for you
This fire is truly your deed
When all the others fail

I turn to you, baby
You see
Oh
(Oh this I need)


Oh this I need
Oh this I need

It's so seldom
People tell you what you wanna hear
It's so rare
That your adventure overcomes your fear
Oh this I need

If this is an addiction
Why do I feel so free?
All I know is
Oh this I need


No
2001 is not that far away
Oh, no

Yes, I live in the future every single day
(Oh this I need)
Every second brings me closer
To something that you'll say

In your hallucinogenic, funky fire-starting ways
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)
Wow
I'm with this
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)
Oh



Oh this I need

Wow
I'm beautiful
Or so you tell me so
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)

You say I've got the body
That you just love to hold
(Oh this I need, oh, this I need)

So, baby
When I say I burn for you
This fire is truly your deed

When all the others fail
I turn to you, baby
You see
Oh
I'm with it, baby


Oh this I need
