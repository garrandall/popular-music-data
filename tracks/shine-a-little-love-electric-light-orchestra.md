Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize.
I guess you had your way.
You see I gotta make you understand.
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say.
But it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day.


You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.

Remember,tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember,tonight we're gonna say.
We'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before.
But I really need you darlin' every day I need you more.



Can you understand.(Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right.
(I know it is) Will you be the same.(I'll do it all again).

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better.
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her.
Thay couldn't see and they just didn't understand.
And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand.

Can you understand.(Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right.
(I know it is) Will you be the same.(I'll do it all again).

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you.
I really can't believe.
We're walkin' out into the world tonight.
We'll do it all again until the break of light.
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes
