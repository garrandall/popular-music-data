Should my heart not be humble, should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble on the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime wanders far from fold
Comes the darkness and the frost, I get lost, I grow cold
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
Or that I can do is, pray, stay with me
Stay with me
