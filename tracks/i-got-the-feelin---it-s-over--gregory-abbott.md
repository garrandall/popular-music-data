Hey hey, hey... hmmm

Sometimes I feel you're in love with me, baby
Other times I wonder there's no peace of mind, yeah
Ooh, I'd like to know what you feel for me, sugar
Is it really real or is it just a lie, yeah?

I'd like to know, baby (I'd like to know) is there a chance for us?
Or is this the end, baby (is this the end?) of our romance?

I got the feeling it's over (hey hey hey hey)
The funny feeling that it's over (well well)
I got the feeling it's over (yeah, yeah)
The funny feeling that it's over (mmm-hmm)

I thought we had such a love affair, baby
Was I so wrong? is it over now, over now?
Tell me, is there a chance for us or this is the end?

I got the feeling it's over
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling) (no no)
The funny feeling that it's over now (I'm such a lonely man)
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling)
Sometimes I can't go on, no (the funny feeling that it's over now) hey!

(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling it's over now)
Hey, hey, hey, yeah!

Tell me is there a chance for us? hey...

I got the feeling it's over (oh baby)
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling) (oh darlin', hey)
The funny feeling that it's over now, I got the feeling it's over
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling)
(Our love was right on time, now you've gone and blown my mind, yea)
The funny feeling that it's over now (hey)
I got the feeling it's over (oh sugar)
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling) (oh yeah yeah yeah)
The funny feeling that it's over now, I got the feeling it's over
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling) (ooh...)
The funny feeling that it's over now (hey hey hey hey)
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling)
(Yeah) the funny feeling that it's over now (uh uh now)
I got the feeling it's over (ooh...)
(I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling)
The funny feeling that it's over now (because you love me, girl)
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feeling)
