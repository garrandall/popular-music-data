Oooooo...
She lets her hair down
When the sun comes up
She lets her hair down
She walks barefoot
Through the meadow
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Every day
And she lets her hair down
When the sun comes up
Yes, she lets her hair down
She wakes up the sleepy flowers
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
On her way yeah
And the morning grows bright
With the newborn light
Yes, the morning grows bright
She lets her hair down
When the sun comes up
She lets her hair down


Ooooooooo...
She lets her hair down
When the sun come ups
She lets her hair down
She goes walking past my window
Early in the morning
Every day yeah
Some day I'll reach out and touch her
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
One fine day yeah
And I'll give her my love
'Til the day I die
Yes I'll give her my love
While the morning grows bright
With the newborn light
While the morning grows bright
She let her hair down
When the sun comes up
She let her hair down
Ooooooo
She let her hair down
Ooooooo
She let her hair down
When the sun comes up
Ooooooo
Let her hair down...
