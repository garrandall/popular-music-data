Oh oh oohohoh

I got a good thing, I ain't gonna give it up
I got a mighty good thing, ain't gonna give it up

The girl I got, just won't quit
She won't stop lovin' for just a little bit
She's fine as wine, she's just my kind
That ever so fine, it wanna make me blow my mind

I got a good thing, ain't gonna give it up
I got a mighty good thing, ain't gonna give it up, ha

She knows how to love me when I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me, WHOA, she makes me feel so glad
She's my sex machine, she knows just what to do
She knows how to love me, she just makes me feel so true, uh
Squeeze me when I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me, huh, she make me feel so glad
I got a good thing, I ain't gonna let her go
I got a pretty good thing, I ain't gonna give it up, uh

She knows how to love me when I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me, she makes me feel so glad
She picks me up, never lets me down, ah, she brings me up, ah
She keeps my funky soul above the ground
Hey, I got a mighty good thing, ain't gonna give it
Know I got my sex machine, I ain't gonna give it up
Do you want a good thing? Don't have to give it up
Do you need a good thing? Ain't gonna give it
Everybody got a good thing, they ain't gonna give it up
It's my thing, I ain't gonna give it up
My thing, will not give it up
It's my thing, I ain't gonna give it

Can I holler? (Yeah) Let me know (Yeah)
Can I holler? (Yeah) Can I holler? (Yeah)
Can I holler? (Yeah) Can I holler? (Yeah)
Can I holler? (Yeah) Let me holler (Yeah)

Oh oh oohohohh,ohoh

Hey, hey, hey
I wanna play some funky organ
Some funky organ
I need some, some funky organ
I need some, some funky organ
