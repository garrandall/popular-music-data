Hey ladyâ¦
Confessing baby every little thing you do drives me crazy,
They donât wanna see you with me, baby girl theyâre just hating,
They just wanna be you, so they taste the love weâre making,
Am just saying..,
Letâs keep it between you and me girlâ¦., ah ah hmm oo yeeaah
If you give me you, imma give you everything you need,â¦.ah ah hmm oo yeeaah
They way wey you dey do, what you do, when you doing it to me.., na the way wey you dey do me
I canât let you go, girl I need you canât you see
Cos its only us against the world., yeh


We can do it all night,
Donât care if they donât like it,
Might be wrong but it feels right,
Donât care if they fight cos,
I canât get enough, you too much,
Girl na only you I want yea yea
Am loosing control,
Letâs increase the tempo,
When we go low..,


Low key,
Know they wanna know,
But thereâs no me,
Girl I really love the way you love me,
They want me to let you go,
But I no go gree whoo weee
Low key low key
Omoge fa wo me ka lo
Low key low key
Baby mi sun mo bi ka lo


Now weâre in the mood., hmm hmm o yea
Girl I no go lie I fit kpe by the way you move babe, olorun,
And e no consign no body wetin we dey do, je ko gbo enu soun.,
Like when I put it on you and you put yours back into it..,
Baby letâs do it, letâs do it..,yeah yeah


Checking on the phone,
No body needs to know,
Go with the flow,
Just keep it on the low,
Donât say a word,
Just meet me outside the club,
Cos tonight we gon make sweet love,
I canât get enough, you too much
Girl na only you I want
Am loosing control,
Letâs increase the tempo,
When we go low


Low key,
Know they wanna know,
But thereâs no me,
Girl I really love the way you love me,
They want me to let you go,
But I no go gree whoo weee
Low key low key
Omoge fa wo me ka lo
Low key low key
Baby mi sun mo bi ka lo


Girl you got a picture perfect frame, with modern curves,
Jealous bitch just playing games,
Theyâre just angry birds,
So where are we going whoâs place,
Baby mine or yours,
Now while we ride just seat back and let me rhyme a verse,
They hit the high notes,
I hit the right notes,
Theyâre on the ground like most,
Now watch how its goes,
I donât need to brag,
But sometimes mummy I boast,
I eat rappers and most of these niggas are toast,
You donât know the good loving till you taste mine,
I just wanna be the reason why your face smile,
See girl to tell you, see your man is a waste now.,
No time to waste baby I can take his place now..,
Hmm yeah, just keep it on the low though,
Youâre gonna keep coming back
Just remember I say you
And if this love is a crime,
They should call the popo,
And if thatâs means doing time,
Youâre the jail am going to

Low key,
Know they wanna know,
But thereâs no me,
Girl I really love the way you love me,
They want me to let you go,
But I no go gree whoo weee
Low key low key
Omoge fa wo me ka lo
Low key low key
Baby mi sun mo bi ka lo
