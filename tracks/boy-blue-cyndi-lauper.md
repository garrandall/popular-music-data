You never knew yourself well enough
But she never knew you at all
And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence
But not your soul

Tell me where is little boy blue
You'll find him standing always
One step ahead
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street
... Kids walking, just a kid walking

You send a letter with photographs
And I'll tuck them under my dreams
And if we wake up old beyond our years
Not quite as brave as we seem
It's just the pain that never disappears

Tell me where is boy blue
You'll find him standing always one step ahead...

Dance a little, cry a little...

Where are you boy blue
Where are you...
