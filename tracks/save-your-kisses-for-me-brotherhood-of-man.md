Though it hurts to go away, it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you), you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (I love you), all the while
With your cute little way will you promise that you'll save


Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say


That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds 'til I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute, honey gee, won't you save them up for me


Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three
