I'll pick you up at 7
We can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning
But you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before
So baby promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too
Yeah

You gotta be be good to me 
I'm gonna be be good to you 
We'll be happy as can be 
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby

I'm gonna treat you right
We'll never fight
Now baby you can trust me
When I hold you tight
I feel alright
I guess that I'm just lucky
I've been hurt before
So baby promise that you're gonna be true oh
