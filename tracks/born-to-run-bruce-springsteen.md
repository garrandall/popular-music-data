In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines

Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby, we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider

But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the Palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide

Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 

And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Come on, Wendy, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Ru-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Uh-uh-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-un
