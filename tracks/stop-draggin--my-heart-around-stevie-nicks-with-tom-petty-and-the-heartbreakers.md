Baby you've come knockin' on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
I said "Yeah, well what am I s'pposed to do?"
I didn't know what I was gettin' into

So you've had a little trouble in town,
Now you're keepin' some demons down,
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my heart around

It's hard to think about what you've wanted,
It's hard to think about what you've lost,
This doesn't have to be the big 'get even'
This doesn't have to be anything at all,

I know you really wanna tell me 'goodbye',
I know you really wanna be your own girl

Baby you could never look me in the eyes
Yeah you buckled with the weight of the words,
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my heart around,

There's people runnin' round loose in the world
Ain't got nothin' better to do
Make a meal o' some bright eyed kid
You need someone lookin' after you

I know you really wanna tell me 'goodbye'
I know you really wanna be your own girl

Baby you could never look me in the eyes,
Yeah you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my-
Stop draggin' my heart around,

A-haaa

(Stop draggin' my heart around)
(Stop draggin' my heart around)
Hey, hey
(Stop draggin' my heart around)
Hey, hey
(Stop draggin' my heart around)...

END.
