When we're up and dancing on the floor, darling
And I feel like I need some more
And I feel your body close to mine
And I know my love it's about that time
Makes me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Well you've got me goin'
Like I knew you would

And the music's in me
And I feel real hot
Then you kiss me there
And it feels real good
Cos I know you'll love me like you should
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
Woooh
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you kiss me
I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you hold me
Real, real, real...
