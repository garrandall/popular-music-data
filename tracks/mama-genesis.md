I can't see you mama
But I can hardly wait
Ooh, to touch and to feel you mama
Oh, I just can't keep away

In the heat and the steam of the city
Oh, it's got me running and I just can't brake
So say you'll help me mama
Cause its getting so hard
Oh!

Now, I can't keep you, mama
But I know you're always there
You listen, you teach me, mama
And I know inside you care

So get down, down here beside me
Oh, you ain't going nowhere
No, I won't hurt you mama
But it's getting so hard
Oh!

Ha ha, ha ha ha ha, ha ha, argh
Ha ha, ha ha ha ha, ha ha, argh

Can't you see me here, mama
Mama, mama, mama, please
Can't you feel my heart
Can't you feel my heart
Can't you feel my heart, oh
Now listen to me, mama
Mama, mama
You're taking away my last chance
Don't take it away
Can't you feel my heart?

Ha-ha, ha
Ha-ha, ha
Argh

It's hot, too hot for me, mama
But I can hardly wait
My eyes they're burning, mama
And I can feel my body shake
Don't stop, don't stop me, mama
Oh, make the pain, make it go away, hey he-ey
No, I won't hurt you, mama
But its getting so hard
Oh!

Now I can't see you, mama
But I know you're always there
You taunt, you tease me, mama
But I never, never, never can keep away

It's the heat and the steam of the city
Oh, got me running and I just can't brake
So stay, don't leave me, mama
Cause its getting so hard
Oh!

Don't go
No, no, don't go
Mama, mama, don't go
No-hoh-hoh, don't go
Ha ha don't go...
Ha ha don't go...
Don't go!
Don't go!
