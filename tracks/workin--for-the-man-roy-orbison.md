Hey, now you better listen to me, everyone of you
(Hoo!)
We got a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta work to do
(Hoo!)
Forget about your woman and that water can
(Hoo!)
Today we're workin' for the man


(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
Well, pick up your feet, we've got a deadline to meet
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
I'm gonna see you make it on time
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
Don't relax, I want elbows and backs
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
I wanna see everybody from behind


'Cause you're workin' for the man
Workin' for the man
You gotta make him a hand
A-workin' for the man
(Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)


(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
So I'm pickin' 'em up and I'm layin' 'em down
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
I believe he's gonna work me into the ground
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hee!)
I pull to the left, I heave to the right
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
I wanna kill him, but it wouldn't be right


'Cause I'm workin' for the man
Workin' for the man
Gotta make him a hand
A-workin' for the man


(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
Well, the boss man's daughter sneaks me water
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hoo!)
Every time her daddy's down the line
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hee!)
She says, "Meet me tonight, love-a me right"
(Oh, whoa, whoa, hee!)
And everything is gonna be fine
(Oh, whoa, whoa, ha!)
So I slave all day without much pay
(Oh, whoa, whoa, ha!)
'Cause I'm just a-bidin' my time
'Cause the company and the daughter, you see
(Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
They're both gonna be all mine


Yeah, I'm gonna be the man
I'm gonna be the man
Gotta make him a hand
If I'm gonna be the man


A-workin' for the man
A-workin' for the man
I gotta make him a hand
Workin' for the man
