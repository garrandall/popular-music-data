You brought the joy
Back into my life
Oh you put a prayer
Into my life

I was drowning in a river of sorrow
With no hope and no tomorrow
Like a ship I was lost at sea
I didn't know my destiny oh oh
But like a strong wind darling you came
And brought me happiness again
I was sinking deeper in doubt
'Til you came and pulled me out oh

Each road I took
Was always wrong
You gave me every chance
To belong

You brought the joy (you brought the joy)
Back into my life
Oh you put the hope (yes you did)
Into my life

My soul was like an empty well
Where a drop of rain never fell
Like a child who's without a home
I'm not baptized and all alone oh oh

I had a one way ticket to nowhere
At every stop I found despair
Like an angel you came to me
And laid heaven at my feet oh

Each road I took
Was always wrong
You gave me every chance
To belong

You brought the joy
Back into my life (I wanna thank you)
For putting a prayer
Into my life

You brought the joy (yes you did)
Back into my life
