Time, you found time enough to love
And I found love enough to hold you
So tonight I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you
Layin' beside you lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door, come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song, music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Lovin' so warm, movin' so right
Closin' our eyes and feelin' alive
We'll just go on burnin' bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the mornin' comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleepin'
And you'll smile when you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keepin'
Layin' beside you lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
You're my song, music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Lovin' so warm, movin' so right
Closin' our eyes and feelin' alive
We'll just go on burnin' bright
Somewhere in the night

We'll just go on burnin' bright
Somewhere in the night!

(We'll just go on burnin' bright)
(Somewhere in the night)
(We'll just go on burnin' bright)

(Somewhere in the night)
