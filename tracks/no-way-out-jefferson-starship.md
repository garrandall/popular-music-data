No intentions 
Whatsoever 
I was gone for a night 
Nothing's forever 
The cruel daylight 
Brought me back to my senses 
(Back to my senses) 
Got caught in here 
Under false pretenses 

No way out 
None whatever 
I made up the story 
Thought it was clever 
She didn't ask 
And I got no reply 
(Got no reply) 
But later that night 
I heard her cry 

No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 

No accusations 
Whatsoever 
But can she forget 
Nothing's forever 
Since yesterday 
She's a little bit colder 
(Little bit colder) 
Won't happen again 
What could I've told her 

No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
Doesn't buy my story 

How can she tell the truth from the lies 
How does she know when to close her eyes 
She doesn't want to lose me 
So she only sees what she wants to see 

No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
She doesn't buy my story 
No way out 
No way out 
No way out
