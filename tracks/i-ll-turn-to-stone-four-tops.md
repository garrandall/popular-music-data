If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

I need your love in every way
Your love I cling to
When things slip away
Without your love
I'll be lost and alone
No reason for living
All purpose would be gone
Without you there
For my eyes to behold
My life would be empty
My heart would grow cold

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

When I think of love
I think of me and you
When I think of happiness
I think of us too
You're my yesterdays
And all my tomorrows
The air I breathe
Everything I need
If from my life
You were ever gone
I'd fall to pieces
You I depend on

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

Darling without you
I'll go on searching
With a lonely heart
That won't stop hurting
Sorrow would be written
On my face
All my tears
Would leave its trace
I would be like a statue in a park
Cold and alone
A man without a heart

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

Turn to stone, turn to stone
Just turn to stone, I'll turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, just turn to stone
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone...
