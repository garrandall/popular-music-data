Oh see, See See Rider
Girl see, what you've done
Oh, oh, oh See See Rider
See what you've done now
You've gone away and left me
Lord, now and now the blues have come, oh yes, they do

Oh, well I'm goin', goin' away baby
And I won't be back till fall
Oh yes I am, going away baby
And I won't be back till fall
If I get me a good lookin' woman
No, no, no, I won't be back at all, all right

And I see, See See Rider, I love you, yes I do
And there isn't one thing darlin'
I would not do for you
You know I want you See See
I need you by my side
See See Rider, ough, keep me satisfied

Oh See See Rider, See See Rider, See See Rider
See See Rider, See See Rider, See See Rider
You keep on ridin', keep on riding
Here I come baby, look out, beat it, all right
Don't lose it now, come one, come on, yeah

Here she comes, she's all right
She's so fine, she's all mine
See See, come on, can we take a ride now, hey

Well, I'm goin, goin' away baby
And I won't be back till fall
Oh yes I'm goin', going away baby
And I won't be back till fall
If I find me a good lookin' woman
No, no, no, I won't be back at all
And that's the truth baby
Listen, I'm going, all right
Somebody told me, somebody told me
I'm Joe Jackson, I'm leavin'
All right, all right, ough!
