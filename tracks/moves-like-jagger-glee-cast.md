Oh yeah,
Watch it, oh
Just shoot for the stars,
If it feels right,
And aim for my heart,
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
And it goes like this


Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you ( But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you ( But it's alright)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger


Maybe it's hard when you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

Oh! So get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Like this


Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you ( But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you ( But it's alright)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain ( Moves like Jagger)
But it's all right now


And it goes like this
I'm jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas


Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you ( But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you ( But it's alright)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
