Damn, has it been that long?
Say, what happened since I been gone, homie?
Y'all got the game all wrong, man, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time

I went from rolling wit' them rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart and I will not stop
But we rock and we roll
And you stop, and we don't, and we don't

Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, you know, you know

Girl, we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go, we go, we go

In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody want it hot, I go through
All of this half of which woulda broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true

Worldwide, bi-coastal, global
Niggas I respect miss it more or go postal
'Cause I ain't got it down mean that they know too
You know Bankhead ain't raise no fools

You know we never not goin' all in
Kickin' doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides, never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G5 tryin' to fit a bunch of broads in

Then we landin', laughin'
Chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagant habitats
As if you never seen tragic happen

Make magic happen with cash, I'm actually catchin' magic
In the market for lavish mansions and NBA expansions
I was passin' out Phantoms in '04 so no, dope ain't mean shit to me
Way past expect to see but it even had a head as big as a nigga finna to be

I went from rolling wit' them rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart and I will not stop
But we rock and we roll
And you stop, and we don't, and we don't

Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, you know, you know

Girl, we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go, we go, we go

So fly, why would I wanna land for?
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could either be a fan boy
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand for it

Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap war's always goin' back and forth
Livin' in the blood killing like cancer
But when arraigned in a court, that's for damn sure

In France, bonjour, merci, oui
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him, shoulda kept your receipt
Got a refund 'cause you sure can't see me

Who keeps CD's on repeat?
Stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day, I was released
The only time you will ever see me free

Big money J, much as you can get for me
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em, cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me

Never mind what I did 'cause the best comin'
I'm the King in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in the bag
Give the rest to me, tell the pilot to put gas in the jet

I went from rolling wit' them rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart and I will not stop
But we rock and we roll
And you stop, and we don't, and we don't

Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, you know, you know

Girl, we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go, we go, we go

I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do J?
Give you a call, I'm the one who used to move yay'
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face

Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase
Whole new wardrobe in a new place
Chain close if a stain if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi, touch

If ya can't lay back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homicide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor, do you mind the guy tried to kill me?

I could still be in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100K downstairs by the tre pound
But if they wonderin' who runnin' the A

Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, yeah you know
Yeah you know, you know, you know

Girl we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go, and we blow

Sayin' you roll and we rock
In control we don't stop
We gon' blow where we drop
Let you know we on top

Girl, we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go and we go

Sayin' you roll and we rock
In control we don't stop
We gon' blow where we drop
Let you know we on top

Girl, we rock and we roll
And you stop and we go and we go
