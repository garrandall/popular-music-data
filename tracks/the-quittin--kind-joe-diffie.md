I know you're holding your breath 
You're wondering what's coming next
Can't be too careful this time
No Love ain't something you trust 
You've seen a little too much of the quittin' kind
That pain you're wrestling with 
I know right where it lives
Been there a couple of times 
Always 'almost in tears' 
Living in fear of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you're got 
I'll tell you one thing it's not
It's not the kind of love that would turn and run
This one's steady and strong 
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time 
It ain't the quittin kind

You don't have to be scared 
We're not going back there
We're going to leave it behind
All that sorrow and grief those bad memories of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you're got 
I'll tell you one thing it's not
It's not the kind of love that would turn and run
This one's steady and strong 
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time 
It ain't the quittin kind

This one's steady and strong 
This one will keep going on and on and on
To the end of time 
It ain't the quittin kind
Quittin' kind no no no 
It ain't the quittin kind
