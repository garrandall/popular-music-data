How can I tell you
To put it all in words
There is so much left to say
But the meaning slips away
How can I show you
To see it through my eyes
Don't deny that part of you
That's been dying for it too

How do I know if I give you too much
Will I scare you away
How do I know when to leave you alone
When to beg you to stay
I wanna know
Just how much love does it take
to get to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
How much love does it take

Moment to moment
I don't know where it stands
Will I end up like the rest
Well it's anybody' guess
Can I persuade you
So softly in a touch
If it's all a waste of time
Well I'm only wasting mine

How do I know when to leave you alone
When to beg you to stay
I wanna know

Just how much love does it take
To get to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
Just how much love does it take
It's up to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
Oh tell me, tell me
How much love does it take
