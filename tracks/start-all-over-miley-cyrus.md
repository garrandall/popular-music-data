I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide


It's sooner than I thought, but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over


Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over


Fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise
You got the warning, hesitation pushed aside


It's sooner than I want, but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over


Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over


It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy (you disrupt me)
I'm gonna start all over (start all over)


Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over


Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over
