I know this isn't what I wanted,
I never thought it'd come this far,
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are


We were young and times were easy,
But I could see it's not the same.
I'm standing here but you don't see me,
I'd give it all for that to change.
And I don't want to lose her,
I don't want to let her go.


I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if it's over,
Cause I would leave you alone.

Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,

Like I did before the storm

Before the storm


With every strike of lightning

Comes a memory that lasts

Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash

Maybe I should give up


I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if it's over,
Cause I will leave you alone.

Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm


Trying to keep the lights from going out

And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm.


Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm

Yeah


Like I did before the storm
