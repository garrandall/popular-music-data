Hey there sugar darlin'
Let me tell you something
Girl, I've been trying to say, now
You look so sweet
And you're so doggone fine
I just can't get you out of my mind
You've become a sweet taste in my mouth, now
And I want you to be my spouse
So that we can live happily, nah-nah
In a great big ol' roomy house
And I know you're gonna groove me, baby
Ah, yeah, now
You make me feel good inside
Come on, and groove me, baby
I need you to groove me
Ah, yeah, now, now, darling
Uhh! Come on, come on!
Hey! Uhh!

Hey there, sugar darlin'
Come on, give me something
Girl, I've been needing for days
Yes, I'm good, good loving
With plenty, plenty hugging
Oh you cute little thang, you
Girl, between you and me, nah-nah
We don't need no company
No other man, no other girl
Can enter into our world
Not as long as you groove me, baby
Ah, come on
Make me feel good inside
Come on and groove me, baby
Move me, baby
Ah, sock it to me, mama
Uhh! Ah, I like it like that, baby
Uhh! Groove me, baby! Hey! Uhh!
Groove me, darling!
Come on, come on
I need you to sock it to me, mama
Come on and groove me, baby
Hey! Uhh! Good, God!
It makes me feel so good inside, mama
Now, come on, come on, and uhh
Groove me, baby, groove me, baby
Ah, sock it to me
Sock it to me
Rock it to me
Come on, come on!
Come on!
And uhh
Groove me, mama, I want you to
Groove me!
