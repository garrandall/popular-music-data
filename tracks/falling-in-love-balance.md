Crazy as it may seem
I keep on having this dream
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love

Maybe it's just not our time
But I don't want to leave it behind
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love with you

I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love

Even now while you're away
I think of you day after day
And there's nothing I can do
I'm falling in love

Don't ever wanna see you upset
Cause I'll be there
To take the next step
Falling in love, I'm falling in love

I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling
I'm falling in love

You could leave me on a cloud
I'd be walking on air
Don't mind if I think out loud
I want you to care for me
Over and over and over again

I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love

I think I'm falling in love

I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love
