A-there's a dance spreadin' round
Like an awful disease
(Hully, Hully Gully)
Oh well, you shake yo' shoulders
And you wiggle yo' knees
(Hully, Hully Gully)

A-this dance goin' around
From coast to coast
(Hully, Hully Gully)
A-when me an my baby do it
Child, we do it the most
(Hully, Hully Gully)

A-mama, Hully Gully
Papa, Hully Gully
Baby, Hully Gully, too

'Come on let's take a lesson, now'
(Hully, Hully Gully)

'Alright, shake yo' shoulders, now'
(Hully, Hully Gully)

'Alright, wiggle yo' knees, now'
(Do the Hully Gully)

A-wail, now
(Really, Hully Gully)
Mama, Hully Gully
Sure can, Hully Gully
You can Hully Gully, too

Well
I went to a party, now
And what did they do?
(Hully, Hully Gully)
Now, everybody's doin' it
Now, why ain't you?
(Hully, Hully Gully)

Everybody look like he's got the shake
(Now they Hully Gully)
Just listen here, brother
That is all it takes
(Now they, Hully Gully)

Mama, Hully Gully
Papa, Hully Gully
And baby Hully Gully, too

Mama, Hully Gully
Baby, Hully Gully
And you can Hully Gully, too

'Whew'!

'Hold it, hold it, hold, hold it'

Unk bkgrnd:
'I'll make time you wanna call it?
He asked for one more time, so that's it! '
'Maurice, can't help it'

'One mo'-oh, again

(We'll be slowly movin')
'All of us work a little while, now'
(We'll be slowly groovin')
'That's the way I like it'
(We'll be slowly movin')

'I bring ho's even with us'
(We'll be always movin')

Unk bkgrnd:
Why you bringin' ho's for?

Do a little cha-cha
Then you do the Foot Stomp
Everybody's here gonna get aboard
(Woo-woo)

(We'll be always movin')
Get the police coming out
(We'll be holy rollin')
'I'm in the Soul Train'
(We'll be holy someday)
'Oh, shake that thing, honey'
(We'll be really groovin')

We're gonna do the Hully Gully
Never gonna stop
Tell me anybody here
Who learned to do The Slop?

(Will be slowly groovin')
Bring uncle along
(Groovin', always movin')
Auntie, too!
(Do the hully gully)
Don't forget about the cousins
Nieces, nephews
(We'll be slowly groovin')

Auntie, Hully Gully
Auntie, Hully Gully
Brother, sisters, nephews, nieces
Gramma, too!
(With the Hully Gully)

'Oh, shake that thing'
(With the Hully Gully)

'That's the way I like it'
(We'll be).
