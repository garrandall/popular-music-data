The days and nights you sit around wondering where can
she be
Hoping that she might appear, out of nowhere
But you fail to see

All the hurt inside, the wounded pride
Oh what she went through for you
You cheated and lied, as her love slowly died
And her heart just broke in two

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll do fine on her own

What you thought was a game
A game you were winning
Wouldn't go your way
Now you've lost what you had
And your back to the beginning
It's the price you have to pay

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll get by on her own

She hides the pain
But her heart turns to stone
No time for pity
When her heart turns to stone
She cries sometimes
As her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll get by on her own

Yeah it's over
And her heart turns to stone
Don't look for pity now
When her heart turns to stone
Listen to her cry
Listen to her cry
She's a woman now
Oh it's a sad thing to see
To see a heart turn to stone
The heart of a woman
A heart turned to stone
