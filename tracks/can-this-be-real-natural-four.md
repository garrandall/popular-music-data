I have always been the guy, who coild handle almost anything
I've had money and cars, expensive girls in bars, and I've always had my own song to sing. Ah but you came along, changed the sound of my song, and I've never ever felt like this before so tell me Can this be real? This love I feel. In my heart for you baby, Ah can it really be true? You changed my life so suddenly, I don't know if thiis is me or not. But I like the new me, my new idenity. So don't you ever let the feeling stop. Sometime I try to resists you girl, ah but that would just
Take more than I got. Tell me Can this be real? This love I feel for you baby, Ah can it really be true? Tell me Tell me Tell me. Can this be real, this love I feel for you baby. Ah ummm. Can this be real? The love I feel in my heart for you. Hey hey. Can it really really really be true
Can it be true?
