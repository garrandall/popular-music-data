Seven seas seven skies
Lightning strikes and brave men die
Tatanka great, Tatanka small
When darkness comes they kill them all
Tatanka

You take what you want but you don't ask
You're future doesn't lie with things of the past
The search for freedom will never be found
As long as we stand upon this sacred ground

The curse of the curses upon the land
One day Tatanka will make a stand
Take back the soul of mother nature
Give back the spirit of a world endangered
Tatanka comes, stand and deliver

The souls of the brave lie on forever
The tale of tears is a tale of courage
Tatanka comes from across the river



The battles were fought and the damage was done
The wars not over its just begun
The debt that's owed will never be payed
The promised land will never be saved

The curse of curses fire on the land
Today Tatanka has made a stand
Their forefathers dreams, hopes, and vision
Through children's eyes has it been forgiven



Le Lakota tolowan yelo

Channi tatanka oyate ki
icic' upi nahan taku un
umnipi nahan unkotipi kte k'un
lepa unk' upelo
wasicu ki ahi nahan
wicakasota pi tka
tatanka tawowakan ki lena
hecenanhgluhapelo

This is a song for the Lakota

Long time ago the buffalo
nation gave themselves
so we can survive and
have shelter
The white man came
and wiped them out
but we still have the spirit
the power of the buffalo

Tatanka comes, stand and deliver
The souls of the brave live forever
The trail of the rears is a tale of courage
Tatanka comes, Tatanka comes
