Yeah... this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track you locked the flow
So far from hanging on the block of dough
Notorious, they got to know that!
Life ain't always what it seems to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we're still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams

In the future can't wait to see
If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime
The night they took my friend
Try to black it out but it plays again
When it's real feelings' hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you

Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you're in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6
Shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Making hits stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you

Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over

I know I'll see your face
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make

Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make

Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make

Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a price to pay
I'll be missing you
