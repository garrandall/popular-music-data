It feels so good to be back! 
Polow, Usher baby (yeah, Zone 4) 
How you doin Gucci? (yeah) (Zone 6) 


Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh

Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh


Rose by fifty 
Uh Now she tipsy 
Slow dancing in my mansion with no panties 
Want to get me 
Three girls Gucci trippin 
Thats a lot of women 
Expensive denim jeans on 
Designer heels ya feel me? 
I donât want no violence 
But damn she tryin to kill me 
She tryin to make me feel her 
Iâm trying to make her feel me 
She just had a long day 
Know i got that long cake 
I give her that long scream 
I fuck with her the long way 


Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh

Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh


Bang bang OKA 
Where you want to go today 
No she is not a prostitute 
But if she was Iâd have to pay 
Say, lay, you can stay 
I sex you up couple days 
Tell your girl no need to front 
She want participate 
Gucci ainât eliminate 
4 girls with me 
Simply i glaze they ass 
Just like some churches biscuits 
Beat her like she stole my Bentley 
Swagger jackers pay attention 
Cali girl, ATL, Detroit, New York girls be with me 


Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh

Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh


I had a girl left alone 
Gucci Maneâs a bachelor 
Sex tape just like Pamela 
Cause Gucci not an amateur 
Mini skirt, sun dress, booty shorts, Monster 
Her ass phat as two basketballs 
Gucci fittin to dunk her 
Pretty like Mariah 
Finer than Alicia 
Sexy just like Trina, dawg 
I bet she a keeper! 
Turn me on like Keri 
No she is not scared of her 
Probably sex her every UH 
Cause lil mama is fine as fuck! 


Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh

Cause the spolight ainât nothin without ya girl 
And the dance floor ainât nothing without ya girl 
You a show stopper ohhhhhh
Lets get it poppin ohhhhhh
