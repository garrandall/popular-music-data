It feels so good to be back!
Polow, Usher, baby (yeah, Zone 4)
Oh, whoa (Uh, uh), oh, yeah
How you doing, Gucci? (yeah!) (Zone 6)


Cause the spolight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa
Cause the spolight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa, yeah
(Ay, ay, Gucci!)


Rose by 50
Uh Now she tipsy
Slow dancing in my mansion with no panties
Want to get me
Three girls Gucci trippin (Gucci)
That's a lot of women
Expensive denim jeans on
Designer heels, you feel me? (Hey, hey, get money!)
I don't want no violence
But damn she trying to kill me
She trying to make me feel her
I'm trying to make her feel me
She just had a long day
Know I got that long cake
I give her that long scream
I fuck with her the long way


Cause the spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa
Cause the spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa, yeah


Bang bang OKA
Where you want to go today
No she's not a prostitute
But if she was I'd have to pay
Say, lay, you can stay
I sex you up couple days
Tell your girl no need to front
She want participate (Yeah)
Gucci on Eliminate
Four girls with Gucci
Simply I glaze they ass
Just like some churches biscuits
Beat her like she stole my Bentley
Swagger-jackers pay attention
Cali girl, ATL, Detroit, New York girls be with me


Ooh, Spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa
Cause the spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa


I had a girl left alone
Gucci Mane's a bachelor
Sex tape just like Pamela
Cause Gucci not an amateur
Mini skirt, sun dress, booty shorts, Monster
Her ass phat as two basketballs
Gucci finna dunk her
Pretty like Mariah
Finer than Alicia
Sexy just like Trina, dawg
I bet she a keeper!
Turn me on like Keri
No she is not scared of her
Probably sex her every UH
Cause lil mama is fine as fuck!


Cause the spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper
Let's get it poppin'
Cause the spotlight ain't nothing without you girl
And the dance floor ain't nothing without you girl
You a show stopper, whoa
Let's get it poppin', whoa, yeah
