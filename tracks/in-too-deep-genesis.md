All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking, wondering
What I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers

Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget


Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to

I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget


Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else


Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this
