Bill collector's at my door
What can you do for me? Hey!
No romance without finance
No romance without finance


Boy, nothin' in life is free
That's why I'm askin' you what can you do for me
I've got responsibilities
So I'm lookin' for a man whose got money in his hands


Cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
Oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
A fly girl like me needs security


Cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me


No romance without finance
I said no romance without finance


Boy, your silky ways are sweet
But you're only wastin' time if your pockets are empty
I've got lots of love to give
But I will have to avoid you if you're unemployed


Cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
Oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
A fly girl like me needs security


Cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me


No romance without finance
I said no romance without finance
No romance without finance
I said no romance without finance


Oh, you look good to me
Your silky words are sweet
But your pockets sure look empty

Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent
