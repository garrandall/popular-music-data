Hey...hey Leroy...Leroy

yeah

Did you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?

Mike...Mike Tyson he's the boy
that played football from Montreal ain't he?

No no you old coop, he a...he a boxer man

yeah

Let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago.
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard
His head flew off into the eigtheenth row



They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row


I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight
And we were watchin'a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes
Jeff was like...

man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?

Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'
Left, right, left, right, another K.O.
If that was me I'd a been ok though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring
With J.L. and Omar we all called Don King
I said 'yeah, Don I got a problem

tell 'em Prince

'yeah what's up? what you sayin? you tryin' to solve 'em?'
'forget the small talk let's get to the nitty gritty'
'me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City'

yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up

Yeah, you can be my trainer

word up?

I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice
And yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can Mike Tyson

man, you can beat him, you can beat him

Yo man, word up
Yo I put on a couple of pounds man we can do this

you can do it



Extra, extra read all about it
Fresh Prince challenges Iron Mike Tyson to a fight
(laughing)
Ah he's crazy

Ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifthteen row?

Hey Leroy, you read the paper?
That boy done lost his man


There was press conference to see what training I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing
Cameras flashing I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little
I said uh I been training 2o hours a day
Lifting big old cars and big bails of hay (that's what he's doin')
And I run 10,000 miles every morning
Thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory
(tell 'em more)
I drink water 20 gallons a pop
And I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block
(he can do it too)
And 4 million sit ups...in a minute...
..I ain't lying I did it
(he done it)
The general public thought I was a fool
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old nieghborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block
There was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop
It was Larwence, my barber, and Franny
He yelled out

Hey, Prince, you can win!

I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat

You could beat him man, if you hit him wit a bat
Ha ha...you gon' get whipped
But can I have your shoes when he break your neck?

Everybody was laughin' out loud
I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surpise her
I heard her on the phone
(a thousand bucks on Tyson)


It's fight day and man am I hyped
Woah I can't wait to see Mike
Boy I'm hyped ready to be my thing
Trump Castle Casino

In this corner...weighing in
At a mere 165 pounds, the Lighting Rodent,
The Fresh Prince! (booing)

And in this corner...
The heavyweight champion of the world...
Iron Mike Tyson (cheering)

I came out hustling sliding and grabbing
Slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'
For a second I looked good out there
But then Mike brought to reality my worst nightmare
One punch, that's all it took (oh
He hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet
Let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner
Said to my coach 'ain't no way I'm goin'
The hell back out there, man you can't forget it'
My body's like a punchin' bag and Mike is gonna (hit it)
They tried to make me go meet my doom
But I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressing room
The next day the headline in the town
'Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins first round'
Some fool asked why I ran away
I said 'a good run is better than a bad stand anyday'
My career is over as far as fightin'
But I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson



Hey Leroy!

yeah

Did you see the fight? did you see the fight?

the...the...the football player?

No the boxer, come on man
I was at the fight last night
I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars
For my ticket right...

ah, you weren't at no fight
I seen you around here last night

..and the boy...the boy ran out the ring

you always lying

I ain't lying...

you lie to your grandkids..

..I seen it...

...you been lying ever since you was a little kid

...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off
His leg fell off and it fell over...

...you always lying

...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand
I said, god damn, I couldn't beleive it Leroy
You shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there

...I was right next to you playin' checkers
