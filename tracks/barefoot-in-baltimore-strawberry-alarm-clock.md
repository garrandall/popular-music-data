Barefoot in Baltimore
Heel and toe with you

Summer turns the stove on
And fun begins to cook
Barefoot walks in Baltimore
With empty pocketbook
Laugh at sizzling sidewalks
Don't step on the cracks
Old folks try to catch their breath
As children catch their jacks

Barefoot in Baltimore
Heel and toe with you

Baltimore is music
Dancing in the street
Half-chewed Dubble Bubble
Tugging at our feet
Melted tar in crosswalks
Crab shells in the park
Pavement frying our poor toes
Until long after dark

Barefoot in Baltimore
Heel and toe with you

When night comes we can go walking
On the shores of Chesapeake Bay
A silence tailored for talking
And a love with so much to say

Barefoot in Baltimore
Heel and toe with you
