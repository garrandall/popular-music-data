If you wanna be with me, yeah
Let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
If you wanna be with me
Well, well, well, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G


Smokin me out to the finish, I thought you knew
I thought they knew, who was up in this
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said would ya please come roll deep
Chocolate Thai, I said I
Got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb thats without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin me out


She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love


I slinkin while I'm thinkin just how good it is
To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin homies on the block, gettin major respect
And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin it always


She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love


This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, cuz its a habit
So don't come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin time is collected, sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced


She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love
