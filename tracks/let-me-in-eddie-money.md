Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in

Oh-we-oh
Driving through the city as I look out through the window
Wondering what it's like to be sleeping on the outside
Watch me take a picture, of the places I've been hoping
Through the mist, thought you looked like someone I remembered
Someone I remembered
Look at hustler walking like she knows somebody's walking
If I try to talk to her, I wonder if she'll know me
Come on take a pill baby, won't you take a ride in my car
Maybe you can show me how we lost what we believe in

Just let me stay here, I'm running from I don't know
Just let me stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Hey Oh (Hey Oh)
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hey Oh (Hey Oh)
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I know it's been awhile, and the years have been unfaithful
Is there nothing left for me that even looks familiar
Everything was easy, when we thought we had the answers
Why you looking at me like I'm?

Just let me stay here, I'm running from I don't know
Just let me stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I won't hurt you, don't stop me, just let me stay awhile
Just let me stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight (Just let me stay here tonight)

Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in

Just let me stay here, I'm running from I don't know
Just let me stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I won't hurt you, don't stop me, just let me stay awhile
Just let me stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, that you can let me in
