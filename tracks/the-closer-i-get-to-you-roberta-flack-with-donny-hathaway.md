The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me


Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel


Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try


Oh, oh, sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way


The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me


Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel


The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured me


The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me (Me, too)
Falling closer, sweet as the gravity
The closer I get to you
