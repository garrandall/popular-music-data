First I'll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
It's time to do ya right
Woah woah, woah

Missin' ya good intentions
Missin' ya from a distance
Hope ya did the same

I know that I caused a problem
I Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don't pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin' nothing gets you nowhere fast
Imma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
It's time to do ya right
Woah woah, woah

Goin' through all the motions
Tryna find a reason
Why we ended that way

Nothin' in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say

Cause goin' to sleep alone at night
I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin' back this time

Now that I'm back around ya
Nothin' around me matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
It's time to do ya right
Woah woah, woah

You know Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right
Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right
