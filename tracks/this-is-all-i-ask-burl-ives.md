As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasures
And so, I happily concede
This is all I ask
And this is all I need

Beautiful girls
Walk a little slower
When you walk by me

Lingering sunsets
Stay a little longer
With the lonely sea

Children everywhere
When you shoot at bad men
Shoot at me

Take me to that
Strange, enchanted land
Grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows
Leave a bit of color
For my heart to own

Stars in the sky
Make my wish come true
Before the night has flown

And let the music play
As long as there's a song to sing

And I will stay younger
Younger than Spring

Wandering rainbows
Leave a bit of color
For my heart to own

Stars in the sky
Make my wish come true
Before the night has flown

(And let the music play)
And let the music play
As long as there is
A song to sing

And I will stay younger
Than Spring
