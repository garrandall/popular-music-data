THE GIRL FROM PEYTON PLACE
There she goes
Her proudly upturned nose..
Just one mistake she made
But yet...
They won't let her forget
There goes
The girl from Peyton Place
I'd be glad
To love her good or bad
To kiss her tears away
But then
Could I take the place of him?
Oh I love
The girl from Peyton Place
Small town talk
Has branded her
She can't break away
From the path that goes
From Peyton Place
But I love her anyway
Sad girl
Please let me in your world
You still have so much love to give
And so much life to live
Oh I love you
Girl from Peyton Place
I need you
Girl from Peyton Place
