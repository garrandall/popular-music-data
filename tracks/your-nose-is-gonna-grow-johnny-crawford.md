I carry your books I give you looks that say "I love you"

I send you flowers Spend my hours thinking of you

But I saw you late last night You were holding another boy tight

Go ahead, explain But remember, if you lie

The bogeyman will get you And your nose is gonna grow

So remember if you lie Ev'ryone will know

Remember, if you lie your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And ev'ryone will know

You're holding my hand Making plans to stay together

Promising me that our love will be forever

If everything you say is true who's the boy I saw with you

Go ahead, explain But remember if you lie

The bogeyman will get you And your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So remember, if you lie ev'ryone will know, ooh-oh-oh

The bogeyman will get you Your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

The bogeyman will..............FADE
