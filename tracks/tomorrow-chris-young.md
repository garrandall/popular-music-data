Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that we're no good


But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no


Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up
When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop
No matter how bad I want to


But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow


Baby, when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save


But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no


Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
Yeah, I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
