Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town, where do you go?
You gotta rock it!


The old folks say that ya gotta end your date by 10, hm-hm
But if you're out on a date don't you bring her home late 'cause it's a sin
You know there's no excuse, you know you're gonna lose, you never win
I'll say it again


And it's all because
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town, where do you go?
You gotta rock it, rock it!


Yeah, I pulled into a drive-in and found a place to park
We hopped into the back seat where it's always nice and dark
I'm just about to move, thinking "Hm, Bret, this is a breeze!"
Then there was a light in my eye and a guy says: "Outta the car, longhair!"
Oo-wee
You're coming with me
Said the local police


And it's all because
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town, where do you go?

Ah, play me a little, C.C

Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
(Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll)
You just stay cool and you ain't about to stop
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock
Your Mama don't dance, no
She just don't dance, no
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll
