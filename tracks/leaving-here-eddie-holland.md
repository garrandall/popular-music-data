Hey, fellas, have you heard the news? Oh yeah
The women of this town are being misused, oh yeah
I've seen it all in my dreams last night, oh yeah
Girls leaving this town 'cause we don't treat 'em right, yeah oh, yeah


Well, I'll take a train, take a train
Fly by plane, fly by plane
They're getting tired, getting tired
They're sick and tired, sick and tired


All you fellas better change your ways, oh yeah
They're leaving this town in a matter of days, oh yeah
Girls are good, you better treat 'em true, oh yeah
Seen fellas run around with someone new, oh yeah


I'm getting tired, getting tired
Sick and tired, sick and tired
They're leaving here, leaving here
Are leaving here, leaving here


Are leaving here, yeah, yeah
Leaving here, been a while
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


The love of a woman is a wonderful thing, oh yeah
The way that we treat 'em is a trying shame, oh yeah
I'll tell you fellas, yeah, it won't be long, oh yeah
Before these women, they all have gone, oh yeah


They're getting tired, getting tired
Sick and tired, sick and tired
Yeah, take a train, take a train
Fly by plane, fly by plane


They're leaving here, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leaving here
Leaving, leaving, oh, leaving here, now
Baby, baby, baby, please don't leave here, oh
