Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all

Got me workin', boss man
Workin' 'round the clock
I want a little of drink of water
But you won't let Jimmy stop

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all

Well, I'm gonna get me a boss man
One gonna treat me right
Work hard in the daytime
Rest easy at night

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all
