You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

You went with me to Alabam
And things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So, we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

You had my child in Memphis
Then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there
So we moved on

To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

Now we've left Alaska
'Cause there was no gold there
But this time
Only two of us moved on

Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
Still you won't let me go
Go on alone

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
