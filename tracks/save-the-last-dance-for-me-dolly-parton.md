You can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You must tell her no

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
