If you think that when you leave me
You're gonna make me cry
Ooh ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
Woo ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
If you think that cause I love you
You can treat me wrong
Ooh ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
Woo ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
You're gonna be sorry for the way you made me cry
You're gonna be so sorry for telling me those evil lies.

Your loving somebody new.
Ooh ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
Woo ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
You're gonna be sorry for the way you made me cry
You're gonna be so sorry for telling me those evil lies.
If you think that it will grieve me
Your loving somebody new.
Ooh ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
Woo ho, no no no, it ain't gonna be that way.
No no no no no no no (fade)
