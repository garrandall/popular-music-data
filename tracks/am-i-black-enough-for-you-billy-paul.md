Am I black enough for you
Am I black enough for you
Am I black enough for you
Am I black enough for you

We're gonna move on up
One by one
We ain't gonna stop
Until the work is done

Am I black enough
Black enough for you
Am I black
Black enough for you

We're gonna move on up
Two by two
And this whole world
Is gonna be brand new

Am I black enough for you
Am I black enough for you

Get in line
Stop marching in time
You better make up your mind
We're gonna leave you behind

We're gonna move on up
Three by three
We gotta get rid of poverty

I got to stay black
Black enough for you
I got to stay black
Black enough for you

We're gonna move on up
Four by four
We ain't never
Gonna suffer no more

I got to stay black
Black enough for you
I got to stay black
Black enough for you

Get in line
Stop marching in time
You better make up your mind
We're gonna leave you behind

Make up your mind
Stop marching in time
Get in line
You better make up your mind

We're gonna get on up
Five by five
And this whole world
Is gonna come alive

Am I black
Black enough for you
Am I black enough for you

We're gonna move on up
Six by six
I gotta use my mind
Instead of my fists

Am I black
Black enough for you
Am I black
Black enough for you

We're gonna move on up
Seven by seven
We're God's children
And we got to get to Heaven

Am I black enough for you
Am I black enough for you

We gotta move on up
Eight by eight
Without no witness
We ain't too late

Am I black
Black enough for you
Am I black
Black enough for you

Freedom, freedom
It got to be spended
I could take it
If I could spend it one time

We got to stay
Black enough for you
I gotta, gotta black
Black enough for you...
