When I see you sky as a kite
As high as I might, I can't get that high
The how you move, the way you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try
And when I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips, I can't lick that far
But when you pout, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go


And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I say
"I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away"


And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah, as smitten as that, I can't get that small
The way you fur, the how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave


And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I know
I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you go
