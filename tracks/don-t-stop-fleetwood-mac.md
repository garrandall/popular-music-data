If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone




All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


Oh, don't you look back
Oh, don't you look back
Oh, don't you look back
Oh, don't you look back
