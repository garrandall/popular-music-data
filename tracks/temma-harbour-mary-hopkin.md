In a giant lemon tree
Alone my friend and me
We both climb down, and cross the sand
Until we reach the sea
And the waves come higher, higher
As we sway and dance
And the way i feel, makes me want to take a chance.
Chorus
Sing a song of temma harbour
Climb a coconut tree
Catch a fish and light a fire
Drink some wine with me
And if you say you like me
And i like you
We can live and dream together
In a world that's new
Sunshine, sunshine,
Sunshine, sunshine, sun, sun, sun, sunshine
In a tree house here we lay
Above the blue sea spray
The tide rolls in and on the wind
The guitars begin to play
And the waves come higher, higher
As we sway and dance
And the way i feel,
Makes me want to take a chance
Chorus
