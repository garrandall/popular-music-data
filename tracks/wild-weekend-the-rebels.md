Sand bar on the river with a cooler of beer
Half a dozen girls and the water is clear
Ladies itâs OK to take your tops off

A perfect combination with the sun and the sand
I always try to keep some tannin lotion in hand
Ladies let me know if I missed one spot

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldnât believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way that I live my live
Itâs a country boyâs paradise

Lilâ string bikinis and corona flip flops
Me and my buddies standinâ on the toolbox
Ladies itâs OK to take your tops off

I think that Iâm in heaven would you give me a pinch
And I know what it means when that little blonde winks
Maybe me and you need to go for a walk

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldnât believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way I live my live
Itâs a country boyâs paradise

Wanna party on boat, headed to the beach
So many girls, look so sweet
Now baby doll, whatâs your plan
Could you ride with me? You bet you can
With a white t-shirt and an all red thong
She jumped right in lost her phone
I saw her frown and I said whatâs wrong
She grabbed a beer and said itâs on
Donât look now but sheâs on the boat
Droppinâ it down and gettinâ low
People are cominâ from all around
And we look like a floatinâ town
Oh my my oh hell yeah
She danced so low her face is red
She let out one big rebel cry
And the top came off and she let it fly

Wild women in white t-shirts, I couldnât believe my eyes
I stay away from the weekend work and it comes to no big surprise
I love the way that I live my live
Itâs a country boyâs paradise
