Every time I see her she don't even look my way
Maybe she will notice me, but then what would I say?
I would say what's on my mind
But the words are hard to find
But I'm gonna try to tell her anyway
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's fine, so fine
Other guys who meet her may not think she's much to see
I can't begin to tell you what she always does to me
Maybe it's the clothes she wears
Or the way she combs her hair
Oh, that makes me want to tell her that I care
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's fine, so fine
(Guitar Solo)
Maybe it's the clothes she wears
Or the way she combs her hair
Oh, that makes me want to tell her that I care
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's fine, so fine
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild...
(Fade Out)
