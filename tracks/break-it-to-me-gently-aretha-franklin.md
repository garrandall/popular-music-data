It was so easy baby, you made it so easy, yeah
You knew exactly what to say and do
Had all the answers, you knew how to please me
How'd you guess I'd fall in love with you?
Now I'm scared, ooh, I'm scared what we're coming to

Oh, break it to me gently, be careful of what you say
And save it, save it, save it
Save it, save it, save it, save it for tomorrow
Maybe then you'll stay one more day, hey yeah

It was so easy, baby, you made it so so easy, yes, you did
I'm weak now, darling, need your tenderness
I gave you my loving, oh baby, and all my sweet music
Why'd you give me what you knew I would need?

Are you sure, really really sure it has to end like this?
If you don't love me, if you don't need me

Oh, break it to me gently, be careful of what you say
And save it, save it for tomorrow
Maybe, baby you'll stay, you'll stay, oh, one more day

I need, I need you, I need you, baby
I need you, baby, one more hour
Oh yeah, I need you, oh I need you
Ooh baby, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now one more day
Oh yeah, I need you, baby, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you one more hour
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you, baby, one more day
