(You'd better go)
I know it's getting late
Just another kiss before you say goodnight
Uum, come on and hold me tight.
(You'd better go)
Please don't close the door
I'm feeling something new,
I never felt before
Uum, just another minute more.
(You'd better go)
I know this isn't fascination
Look at me, look at you
Falling in love.
It's got to be love.
I just don't have an explanation.
Why do you, why do I
Suddenly see
Out of a crowd,
Only each other.
(You'd better go)
Well goodnight girl,
I know that I won't sleep a wink the whole night through
I'm gonna think of you
After I go.
I'd love to stay.
(You'd better go)
