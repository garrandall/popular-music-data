Alright turn everything in the mixer
Let's go

Woah Woah
Woah Woah

You really got glow
Woah Woah
You really got glow oh ohhh
This issss

You shinin' like sun-rays
Go down
Let me see you go down
You shinin' like sun-rays
Go down
Let me see you go down
My beautiful sun-ray

We roll up in that place
She wants...
I had to roll up in my shades
Swagga sharper than a fade
Moving harder with her waist
Next time round I'll bring her home
She'll put your father in her days
I told my mama and my mates
Kwami and Ojay
She was lookin' hotter than a sauna in the place
In my corner thinkin' wait
Gyal you too bad
I could make you sun down

You shinin' like sunrays
Go down
Let me see you go down
You shinin' like sunrays
Go down
Let me see you go down
My beautiful sun-ray

I had to close my eyes
Imagine you're my woman and imagine you're my wife
And them bruddas over there got nothing on you with their ice
It was you that appeared when got said let there be light
Awkward
Because
Beep Beep
When you walk past
Too poor
Her number
It should be, with a superstar
Ay
So I'm a shooting star


Alright over here
Ice Cream
Kone

Should have saw the arse on her (yeah)
Told me take a picture it'll last longer (uh huh)
Heart stopper (stopper)
In them polaroids
Think her name was Emily
Said she wants a Naughty Boy (behave)
I give her TLC when its chilly out
Caribbean girl you get the willy bounce (kaboom)
In the car, in the house (ina house)
Don't take the Mickey, come gimme that Minnie Mouse (oh yeah)
Be my sunshine and I can be your starllight
Soon as we clocked eyes I knew it was our time
Dirty girl let me get you out them high jeans / hygiene


Fresh


So I'm a shootin' star


I was riding through my city when
I saw this pretty little thing
Shining like a sun-ray
Throwing shade on everything (ey)
Just to feel her on my skin I'd fly across the world
Right now it revolves around her
You were born a star so I give you your space
We should have a son
Maybe call him Ray
How you shine so frickin' bright
I feel the need to make it rain
It's too soon to get engaged but let me give you a ring
Cause I can be your soul in your solar
Or I can be your moon when it goes dark
I chase you around the world like a myth
But when we kiss make a total eclipse (rah)


Ohhhhhh Haaaaaa
Ohhhhhh Eyeeeey


Krept
I can be your superman
If you wanna escape {S cape}
Get it?
Superman. S cape
We text late to get x-rated
You get naked we sex tape it
You orgasm (uhh) (Kaboom)
That's you detonating
Girl are you feelin' me
Just had an epiphany
Gave her a hickey and D
Now its all hickory dickory
Touchin' and kissin' me
Do it like Yeezy and Kimberly
D was so big when I pulled it out
She was like, don't you belittle me
Nubian with a rare body
You shinin', well hair Johnny
I mean here's a jimmy
What you here with me
Heated up now your hair's frizzy
You a sun-ray, now let it burn
Bum shape, hella firm
She don't even like pancake
But she wants some Krept tonight
