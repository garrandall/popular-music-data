Yeah, yeah yeah
Mmm
Yeah
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Yeah


Hey, why don't you just stop trying to be so cool
And let me know the lowdown of how you feel about things
Oh, you ain't doing nothing but jivin', baby
And we've got a very serious problem, yeah
Yeah


Come on, baby
(It's time to get down, down, yeah)
It's time for you to stop playing with my feelings, girl
Come on, girl, get on down, down, baby
(It's time to get down, down, yeah)


Oh, if this was anything else, you'd make up your mind right away
And it seems like to me you're trying your best to delay
Can't you see I wanna love you?
As long as you want it, baby
As long as you need it, baby
Oh, baby, baby


Believe me when I tell you every word I say is true
Cause, honey, I adore you (Adore you, adore you)
And all this time we've been wasting, baby
Is only a game for fools
Yeah


Come on, baby
(It's time to get down, down, yeah)
It's time for you to stop trying to be so cool now, mama
Come on, girl
(It's time to get down, down, yeah)


Oh, if you would only stop, mama
Stop all that stumbling that you're doing
And come on, come on in, and give me all the things I need
Can't you see I wanna love you?
As long as you want it, baby
As long as you need it, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby


It's time to get down, girl (Oh, baby)
Come on
(It's time to get down, yeah)
Yeah
It's time for you to stop playing with my feelings, girl
Come on, come on, girl (It's time to get down, yeah)
Oh
Come on, baby
(It's time to get down, yeah)
As long as you want it, baby
As long as you need it, girl
(It's time to get down, yeah)
Come on, come on, girl
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(It's time to get down, yeah)
It's time for you to put your arms around me
God bless the day you found me, girl
(It's time to get down, yeah)
Come on, girl
Yeah
(It's time to get down, yeah)
