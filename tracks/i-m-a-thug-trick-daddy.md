Funk, hit me up with some of that thug
Yup, just like that, hit 'em in the chest with it
One time, one time again in the head
For Buddy Roe y'all, check it out


I don't know, what this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing, that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day, baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world; uh uh, cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard, baby cause I'm a thug
Ah hah, oh yeah; check it out


Could it be my baggy jeans, or my gold teeth
That make me different from y'all
Ain't trippin' dog, but listen dog
I was raised a little different than y'all
I'm just doin' my thing, usin' my ghetto slang
And I'm representin' thug shit
Niggas who I roll with
Watch them niggas they're gon' love this
Niggas who - out on bond, on the run
And got ten years on parole
Since you can't say it dog, I'mma say it for y'all
Motherfuck the po-po's
Fuck the judge and C.O.'s, fuck the D.A. and P.O.'s
Fuck the family of the victim
Witness, and snitchin ass hoes - nigga


I don't know, what this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing, that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day, baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world; uh uh, cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard, baby cause I'm a thug
Ah hah, oh yeah; check it out


See I'm so tight, niggas be like
That nigga got so many hoes
And I know he got clout, look at his mouth
That nigga got so many golds
Niggas be tellin' they hoes
There's some'n up with that nigga
Bitch I've been watchin' you watchin him
You must wanna fuck this nigga
My name alone, been known to break up happy homes
No disrespect dog
But you ain't have no business even answering her phone
(Hello, who is this)
If your ass was home, then
Me and her couldn'ta been gettin it on
And you couldn't have been hittin her right
Cause ever since that night she been hittin the phone
She want a thug


I don't know, what this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing, that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day, baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world; uh uh, cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard, baby cause I'm a thug
Ah hah, oh yeah; check it out


Since y'all niggas wanna smoke the blunts, pump the guns
I'mma show you how to thug it dog, thug it dog
Give me half a pill, and some Zephyrhill
And I'm like fuck it dog, fuck it dog
Long as my ecstasy got the best of me, ec-stasy
Then none of you niggas ain't stressin' me
I got one request in this bitch
And you can have the rest of this shit, bitch
If a nigga drop some shit, it's wack as hell
And don't make no damn sense
Take it back, talk about it, and tell your dog
Don't even buy that shit
And I don't care who he is, or where he from
I represent thug shit
And you ain't gotta give me my props or nominate me
Cause dammit, I love this


I don't know, what this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing, that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day, baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world; uh uh, cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard, baby cause I'm a thug
Ah hah, oh yeah; check it out
