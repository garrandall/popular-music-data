Twelve more miles to Tucumcari
I've been hurrying there
To the gal I'm gonna marry
With the yellowest hair

Left right march along
I've just gotta get home (just gotta get home)
Ten more miles to Tucumcari
Then I'll never more roam
(Tucumcari, Tucumcari, I just gotta get home)

Eight more miles to Tucumcari
It's the fourth of July
Been three years in January
Since I kissed her goodbye

Left right march along
I've just gotta get home (just gotta get home)
Six more miles to Tucumcari
Then I'll never more roam
(Tucumcari, Tucumcari, I just gotta get home)

Four more miles to Tucumcari
Not much further to go
Got no time to waste or tarry
She'll be waitin' I know

Left right march along
I've just gotta get home (just gotta get home)
Two more miles to Tucumcari
Then I'll never more roam
(Tucumcari, Tucumcari, I just gotta get home)

Here I am in Tucumcari
Found my yellow-haired gal
Just in time to see her marry
With my very best pal

Left right march along
Guess I better be gone (I better be gone)
A thousand miles from Tucumcari
I'll be rambling on
(Tucumcari, Tucumcari, I'll be rambling on)

A hundred miles from Tucumcari
Down in Santa Fe
Fell in love with a girl named Mary
Gee I'm happy today

No more marching now
Found my honeycomb (found my honeycomb)
I've forgotten Tucumcari
No more reason to roam
(Tucumcari, Tucumcari)
I've forgotten Tucumcari
No more reason to roam
