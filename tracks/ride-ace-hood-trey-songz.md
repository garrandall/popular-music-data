Chea
Ace Hood
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'm get us out the hood baby


Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood


Listen
Baby look, just ride with me
Swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it
See you aint wit that drama
You be my ride or die like bonnie imma play the clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip I'm grindin bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper callin but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes
That's why I suprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind
Cuz when I'm gone lil mama home alone at every time
You never blowed my phone up yet cuz you respect the grind
And you never holla bout a problem keep it on the line
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride


Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood


And um, we can do them long vacations
Thinking jamaica lately
Cant take them deep relations, baby just keep it patient
Shawty know what I do
Shawty know who I be
You know I'm in these streets the only way that we gon eat
I keep it gutta never cut her when we in them sheets
I get sum cutta grap the duffle then I'm in the streets
Come back with bundles pimp a half a g and louie v
But you aint trippin never question bout a nigga g
We keep it real aint no other that could fill ya sneak's
I ride for you, you ride for me that's where we need to be
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams
Your my beyonce I'm hova won't you ride with me


Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood


Now what's the definition of a rider
Through it all they gon stand right beside ya
If you got one look em in the eyes
Tell em you gon ride
Tell em you gon ride (ri ri ri ri ri ride)
Till the wheel fall off or the day that I die
That's on my life aint nun wrong wit tryna love somebody
Tryna tell you shawty that


Ace, and I promise this to you
Imma get us out this hood
Into them places that you thinkin that you never could
But you gotta ride like them tires on the mini coop
Imma get this cash paper bags and give half to you
Forget them haters
Keep you tailored see whats sexy too
And I like your body all I think about is doin you
And I love the money so I guess it's like doin two
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot


Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper
You aint gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die girl we gon be good
And if you ride or die we gon make it out this hood

Yea yea yea
We gon make it out
We gon make it out this hood
