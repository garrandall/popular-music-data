It's Over
Jimmie Rodgers
1966

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would
Always be, there'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light to make us
Realize our night is over.

When you walk away from me there is no
Place to put my hand, except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises or the land
I watch you walk away somehow if have
To let you go now
It's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet, there are so
Many times that people have to love than forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence trying not
To think at all
I send my feet before me, walk
The silent street before me.
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would
Always be, there'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light, to make us
Realize our night is over.
Its over
