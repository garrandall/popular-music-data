Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them
Rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he'd play his guitar I'd lay back
And watch the stars and sip my wine.

Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies
Through the German lines
Audie I won't leave you here I'll pull you through
'Cause buddy, you're a pal of mine.

Me and Phil Rizzuto didn't we move 'round
Like lightnin' on the double play
I'd look over in the stand and Marilyn
Should see me and she'd smile and wave.

Hell no Coach Lombardi this broken back
Ain't nothin' if the game was saved
And fellers if I don't pull through
Just put a little golden football on my grave.

John Wayne he once said to me
Them Japs will take the Island
And we've got to save
The old Red White and Blue.

Someone's got to swim out
To the submarine and warn 'em
And Bare you know
I hate like hell to ask you to.

Me and Tony Zarro we used to spar together
Up in Stillman's Gym
Knowing someday it would be the Garden
And the championship for me or him.

And Coop if no one in this town is man enough
To back you when Frank Miller comes
Then come High Noon I'll walk with you
I may be young but I know how to use a gun.

Judy Garland don't you cry
You know you can be a star
And with my drinkin'
I'd just hold you back.

Go on and sign the contracts hon
And I'll read about you
In some old newspaper
Blowin' cross some lonesome hobo camp.

Me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them
Rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back
And watch the stars and sip my wine.

Me and Audie Murphy we still crawl out on our bellies
Through the German lines
At away there's scooter shoot that ball to me
And I swear we'll get two this time...
