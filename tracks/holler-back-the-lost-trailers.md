I got a city folk friend in a hip-hop world
He goes by E. Diddy but his name is Earl
Cocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride
Pumpin' nothin' but bass

He says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'
And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

When he says,
'Holler back when you get back home'
I say, 'The only holler back that I know is'

In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

Take a left off the Interstate
Go ten miles
Take a right on Farm Road 99
And just roll 'til the blacktop ends

'Ya see Mary Jo rockin' that front porch swing
Bikini top and them cut-off jeans
And that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins

Ah, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine
Boy, you're guaranteed to have yourself
One hell of a time

In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it so good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

(Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds a get sown)
Ooh...
