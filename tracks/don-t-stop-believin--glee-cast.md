Da, da, da, da... (Repeated until end of the song)


Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere


Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere


A singer in a smoky room


A smell of wine and cheap perfume


For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night


Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill


Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time


Some will win, some will lose


Some are born to sing the blues
And oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, livin' just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night


Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop!
