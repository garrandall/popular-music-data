Jenny got a job, a cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year

Thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
But it still ain't here (hey)

Alright

She been lookin' for Mr. Right so long
But all she found is Mr. Wrong
And that's the pits

She's drawn a line that she won't cross
And her and time are facing off
She says something's gotta give

Somethin' gotta give me butterflies
Somethin' gotta make me feel alive
Somethin' gotta give me dreams at night
Somethin' gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
Yeah, but something's gotta give

Somethin' gotta give

Friday night she had a date
Cell-phone junky, half hour late
Hey that's the biz, baby

She's riding out this twists of fate
She's had all that she can take
She says something's gotta give

Somethin' gotta give me butterflies
Somethin' gotta make me feel alive
Yeah somethin' gotta give me dreams at night
Somethin' gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
Yeah but something's gotta give...

I swear, there's got to be a meant-to-be for me out there
Somewhere, someday
I'm gonna find someone, somehow, someway

Jenny's got a job, a cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year

Oh, she thought by now she'd have a man
With two car seats and a minivan
She says something's got,
Something's got, somthing's got

Somethin' gotta give me butterflies
Somethin' gotta make me feel alive
Somethin' gotta give me dreams at night
Somethin' gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
Yeah but something's gotta
I don't know where it is
Yeah but something's gotta
I don't know where it is
Yeah but something's gotta give

Something's gotta give
