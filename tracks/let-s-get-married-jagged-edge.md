See first of all I wanna tell you what a blessing you are don't how we got this far
I thank God and I know this ain't been easy but you still here some of the reasons I love you
When you help me make it through this, yeah
(Yea do you remember) everybody said
That we wouldn't last give it some time you're young it will past
They don't know what we put in fell in love with my bestfriend
Girl you got values like my momma meet me at altar
I think I wanna marry you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
I know that we young but I've made my mind up
Put in too much time girl what's the hold up
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
I know that we young but I've made my mind up
Put in too much time girl what's the hold up
Let's get married...

Can't nobody tell me nothing about my baby
Started off as friends so I knew we was gone make it
Even though I had some niggas hating on me
Even though you knew my money wasn't the longest
You stayed down for a nigga when I needed you the most
That's why I keep it one hundred and we'll never play you close
Girl you got values like my momma meet me at the alter
Girl, I wanna marry you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
I know that we young but I've made my mind up
Put in too much time girl what's the hold up
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
I know that we young but I've made my mind up
Put in too much time girl what's the hold up
Let's get married...
