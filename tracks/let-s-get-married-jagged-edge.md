See, first of all
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah
When you think about, all the years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about, where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you


Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger (so) we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married


Said I done it all, but frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause making love to just anyone ain't happenin'
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about, us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about, maybe us having some babies?
Come on, won't you be my lady
Forever, girl


I'm ready to, commit to you
And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family


Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married I just want to get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married
