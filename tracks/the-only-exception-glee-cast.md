when I was younger I saw
my daddy cry
and curse at the wind
he broke his own heart
and I watched
as he tried to reassemble it
and my momma swore
that she would
never let herself forget
and that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love
if it does not exist


But Darlin...
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception


maybe I know somewhere
deep in my soul
that love never lasts
and we've got to find other ways
to make it alone
keep a straight face
and i've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
and up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
because none of it was ever worth the risk


well you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception


i've got a tight grip on reality
but I can't let go of what's in front of me here
i know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

oh oh oh


you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception



and I'm on my way to believing
oh and I'm on my way to believing
