The most beautiful words in the world
Are the words when you whisper,
Ooo, "I love you"

The most wonderful sound in the world

Is your voice when you tell me,
"I really need you"

The greatest sight is the love in your eyes
The greatest music, the song in your sighs
The most power and thrill is when I kiss you
And the loneliest time is when I miss you

On the day you gave me your love
I heard the most beautiful words in the world

The most power and thrill is when I kiss you, yes it is
And the loneliest time is when I really miss you

On the day you gave me your love
That day I heard
The most beautiful words in the world
