In this cold world
No matter where I go
The clouds are all the same
To them I'm just
A pebble in the Sand, a face without a name

Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do
But you
And in the shelter of your arms
I find peace and comfort and care
For I am wanted there

In this cold world
I struggle to survive
And sometimes I would fall

You'll think someone
Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl

Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare, your there
And in the shelter of your arms
I find strength and safety in them
I rise and start again

Just give me one good reason
To go on living
To keep on trying
For what
I ask you for what
If not for you and all your love
To see me through

When times look bad
The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear
And this cold world
Can never get me down
As long as you are here

That's why I pray to god
You'll never say goodbye
And I will know the shelter of your arms
And your love for all of my life
Until the day I die
