Lazy Susan, lazy Susan

I can't stand to wait a minute longer
There must be some way to let you know

My love is ready
My heart is beating fast
I'm growing weaker
And I don't know how long I can last

I can't stand to hear this early morning
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
Tossing pebbles at your window pane
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)

I'm trying to wake you
Cause I'm so all alone
I've got to see you
And I won't believe that you're not home

Wake up, Susan
Don't you know what you're missing?
I'm right here
Wake up, Susan
Don't you know what you're missing?
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here

I can't wait to put my arms around you, baby
Only if it's for a little while
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)

My body's aching
I want you oh so bad
Why can't you hear me?
If you'd just wake up I'd be so glad

Wake up, Susan
Don't you know what you're missing?
I'm right here
Wake up, Susan
Don't you know what you're missing?
I'm right here
