I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you



Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove



Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion



I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove




Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
