All my love
All my heart I would give to her
All my life I would live for her
If I had a girl
A little girl like you

Kisses sweet
Arms that tremble to hold her tight
I would bring to her every night
If I had a girl
A little girl like you

I've seen your face
And I've touched your hair
I've dreamed you a thousand times
Oh, I'd know you anywhere

You're the one
You're an angel that heaven sent
And forever I'd be content
If I had a girl
A little girl like you

I've seen your face
And I've touched your hair
I've dreamed you a thousand times
I'd know you anywhere

You're the one
You're an angel that heaven sent
And forever I'd be content
If I had a girl
A little girl like you
