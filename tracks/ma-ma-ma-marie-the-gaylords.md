Aye, who's there!
Ma ma ma ma ma Marie (ma ma ma ma ma Marie)
Oh oh oh oh Marie (oh oh oh oh Marie)
Can't you see what you're doing to me
(Can't you see what you're doing to me)
Love a love a love a love a love there's no play thing
(No play thing)
But to you (but to you) it's an old (it's an old) everyday thing
Ma ma ma ma ma Marie (ma ma ma ma ma Marie)
Oh oh oh oh Marie (oh oh oh oh Marie)
Maybe someday you'll want me to want you
When oh when oh when oh when oh when will it be
Oh oh Marie (oh oh Marie)
Oh Maria-a-a-a-a
Oh Marie
Oh Marie
Oh Marie
Oh Marie
Oh Marie
Oh Marie
