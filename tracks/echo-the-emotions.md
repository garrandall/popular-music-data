Echo, echo, echo
Echo, echo, echo
All I hear is the echo
I call her name
And all I hear is the echo, echo, echo
The echo through my lonely room
I sit and cry
And all I hear is the echo, echo, echo
The echo of her lonely tears
I still remember
That summer night
We were out driving
Everything seemed so right
Then I lost control
The car turned over
I heard her calling
Oh oh, I'll never forget
Now I'm alone
And all I have is the echo, echo, echo
The echo of her lonely call
As long as I live
I'll never forget
Her echo
