All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking, "She don't love him"
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms, you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me
Wake me, when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear

Through these walls so thin, I hear my neighbors when
They say, "She don't love him, she don't love him"
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me for the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me
Wake me somebody when it's over, when it's over
And tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

Girl, you're what my heart desires
My whole world you inspire
I can't bear to be losing you
'Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly, I pace the floor
Listening to my neighbors criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe, I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me, I'm dreaming now

I said, shake me
Wake me somebody when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming
And wake me when it's over, when it's over
Come on and shake me, wake me somebody
When it's over
