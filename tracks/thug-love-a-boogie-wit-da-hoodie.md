Baby you ain't never fuck with a thug
So wassup I'll make you fall in love with it
Make fall in love with it

Fuck it I'm goin in now watch what I do to this
Nobody told me this shit I had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin I'm buggin they think I'm losing it
Micheal Jordan I'm ballin they think I'm hoopin it
She popped a perk and its workin so I go through with it
I sip a cup of the lean and then I go through with it
She moanin, screamin and tell me keep on doin it
I'm A Boogie whats goodie baby I'm true to this
I pulled up in my hoodie so you could know its me
Ayo that's word to my F it ain't no hoe in me
A nigga talk behind my back that's a hoe to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how its supposed to be
I should've put him in the ground,how its supposed to be
Bodies tryin to get found while I'm rollin' weed
Ski mask I'm hoping that they don't notice me
Choppa knock a nigga down on purpose
I'll pull up with a fuckin Trey Pound on pupose (ah)
Ra Sosa got a thottie on me twerkin
Gotti with me waves lettin niggas drown on purpose (ah)
Nay Glizzy he a hound on purpose
That's my dog ill never let him down on purpose
Bubba told me go wild on purpose
Nigga why the fuck you think I'm goin wild on em (ah)
I'm puttin pain on em'
Hollow tip I let it rip
I let I rain on em'
Fuck a hook I put a chain on em
I tie that shit round ya neck
I spill the brains on em'
I know that shit ain't been the same niggas
Change on you for the money and the fame
But I'm
Goin up like a plane nigga
I ain't even gotta tell em I ain't playin with em (ah)

But I'm goin up
Baby you ain't never fuck with a thug
So its all bout make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove
And its tough cause she hold it when I'm done with it


And I ain't even gon' lie
Alot of niggas say they gon' ride
They ain't really gon' ride
They don't want to be a homicide
So they callin niggas broke
But they really playin both sides
I don't trust a nigga bottom lie
And I don't trust a bitch bottom line
Just because she on ya ride
That don't mean she ya ride or die
Your worst enemy could be right by your side

But I'm goin up
Baby you ain't never fall with a thug
So its all bout... how I make you fall in.. baby
How I make you fall in love with it
But you know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove and its tough
Cause she hold it whenever I'm done with it
(yea) She gone hold it when I'm done with it 
She already know wassup with it
I'm the plug with it
Baby now I'm havin fun with it
Imma thug with it

Imma keep on goin tho, keep on goin
Now I'm goin up, baby you ain't never fall with thug so its all bout make you fall in love with it
I think she know.. and she know I keep a gun in glove
And its tough cause she hold it whenever I'm done with it
Now I'm goin up
Baby you ain't ever fall with a thug
So its all bout make you fall in love with it
And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gunn in a glove
And its tough cause she hold it whenever I'm done with it
