It's hard to get along
It's hard to get along
It's hard to get along
We just can't hardly, no no (get along)

I think I want to say it again for you children
(It's hard to get along)
I don't mind if you sing along with me tonight
(It's hard to get along)
I just want you to feel it
(It's hard to get along)
Oh yeah
(We just can't hardly, get along)

Let me tell you why I say that

I got off off of my job
I took it on home like 
I knew my baby would be waiting at the door
But that was my clothes in the middle of the floor
If I tell you that I didn't cry
I would be telling, telling a lie
I was the kind that never stayed out all night
Always tried to keep my finger tight
No matter how you fight to be true
Somebody sure gonna make a fool out of you

(It's hard to get along)
I tell you children
(It's hard to get along)
No matter what you do
(It's hard to get along)
Oh oh
(We just can't hardly, get along)

I want to hear everybody sing it with me tonight

(It's hard to get along)
Do you feel it baby
(It's hard to get along)
Oh yeah
(It's hard to get along)
Oh oh
(We just can't hardly, get along)
No no no no no no

I want to know, can you feel it baby

Oh can you feel it

I got to heal it
I got that soulful feeling
Alright alright
You know I treat everybody right
I try so hard to get along
Oh I don't know what's wrong
I gotta say it again

(It's hard to get along)
I tell you It's hard
(It's hard to get along)
Baby
(It's hard to get along)
Oh oh
(We just can't hardly, get along)
No no no no

I think I want to sing it for you one more time tonight

(It's hard to get along)
I tell you It's hard
(It's hard to get along)
No matter what you do
(It's hard to get along)
Oh oh
(We just can't hardly, get along)
We just can't hardly get along now

I don't know what's wrong with the world today
Sure wish the world would get together yeah
I think we need a little more love now
What the world needs is love love love
