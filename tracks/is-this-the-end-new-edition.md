Is this the end?
Are you my friend?
It seems to me
You ought to be free


You used to be mine when the chips were down
You used to be mine when I weren't around
Girl, can't you see how I feel?
All these feelings that I feel are real
Oh oh, girl
Can't you see I need you?


Is this the end?
Are you my friend?
It seems to me
You ought to be free


You used to be mine when the chips were down
You used to be mine when I weren't around
Girl, can't you see how I feel?
All these feelings that I feel are real
Oh oh, girl
Can't you see I need you?

Aw, baby, is this the end?
Aw, baby, is this the end?


Mama told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then
(Is this the end?)
Mama told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then
(Is this the end?)
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
Is this the end, girl?
(Is this the end?)
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
Is this the end?
(Is this the end?)
I need to know
