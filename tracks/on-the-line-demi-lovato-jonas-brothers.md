I didn't wanna say 'I'm sorry'
For breaking us apart

I didn't wanna say 'It was my fault'
Even though I knew it was

I didn't wanna call you back
Cause I knew that I was wrong

Yeah I knew I was wrong



One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful

We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical

Wanted to call

No need to fight
 
You know I wouldn't lie

But tonight, we'll leave it on the line



Listen baby

Never would have said 'Forever'
If I knew it'd end so fast

Why did you say 'I love you'
If you knew it that it wouldn't last

Baby I just can't hear what your saying
The line is breaking up

Or is that just us?
Or is that just us?



One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical

Wanted to call

No need to fight
 
You know I wouldn't lie

But tonight, we'll leave it on the line


 
I try to call again
I get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread

Apologies are often open ended

But this one's better left unsaid



One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical

Wanted to call

No need to fight
 
You know I wouldn't lie

But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
