Who can I turn to 
When nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know 
And so I must go 
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me 
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way 
And, after the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow 
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal, or borrow 
my share of laughter
With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to 
If you turn away?

With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to 
If you turn away?
