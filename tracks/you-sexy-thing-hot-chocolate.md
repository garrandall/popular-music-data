I believe in miracles
Where are you from, you sexy thing?
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly?
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where are you from, you sexy thing?
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
How does you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know, every night and day for?
Every day, needing love as satisfaction
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where are you from, you sexy thing?
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Oh, touch me, you sexy thing
Oh, touch me, baby, you sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling, you sexy thing
You sexy thing, you sexy thing

Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where are you from, you sexy thing?
I believe in miracles, baby
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Oh, kiss me, baby
Oh, touch me, baby
I believe, I believe, I believe, you sexy thing
Oh yeah, touch me, baby
Oh, hold me, baby
You sexy thing, I love you
You sexy thing, you sexy thing, you sexy thing
