Whoa, oh, oh

I love you, darling
Come and go with me
Please don't send me
Way beyond the sea

Come, come, come, come
Come into my heart
Tell me, darling
Say we'll never part

Please say you'll never leave me
Well, say you never
Yeah, you really never
Please won't you give me a chance


Yeah, play that

One more time, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said
Yes, I really need you

Please say you'll
Never, never leave me

Well, say you never
Don't you know you never
Please won't you give me a chance


Yeah, come rocking with me
Don't you know you need me
Come and go with me
