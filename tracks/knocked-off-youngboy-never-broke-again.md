Who made this shit?
TayTay made the beat
Ayy, fuck all you niggas, yeah
Yeah, free Choppa Boy (You know the don dada, yeah)
We step on anything, and still steppin', nigga (Look)


Went to the bank, I left with fifty in my pocket, nigga
Gang, I been tryna leave 'em blank, this on your noggin, nigga
I got juveniles who steppin', totin' on dirty pistols, yeah
All my niggas out here spinnin', tryna leave a nigga dead
Fuck nigga, what you said? We puttin' you to sleep in your bed
On the bottom the nine, I just put a beam, everything be infrared
Talk like Top, get on these meds
Get out your top, we bust your head
Catch him bad, hop out and spray
Jump out and we slumped his ass
They can't run, we on they ass


I'm like who want beef? Just show me somethin'
I got killers on Front Street and we ain't runnin'
How I come through, shawty, she don't want no other
Pull up and we thuggin', buckin', clutchin' on them cutters
He say he want smoke with me
We gon' get him knocked off
These bitch niggas don't wan' rock with me
My brothers blow your block down
Travel for that price just like a Greyhound
I don't want you, I got cake now
You wasn't loyal, you couldn't stay down
I don't want you in my way now


Can't help you see I'm rich, yeah
Say the wrong thing and you bent
We got FN's and Glock 10s, ten millimeter
YoungBoy hot and I done broke the meter
All this money got me blind, I don't know these people, yeah
She wan' be with me, I just won't date her, won't date her, go
She wan' talk, girl, I don't have no data, no data, no
I stay with that sword just like Darth Vader, Darth Vader, woah
Bitch, I keep that stick, but don't play pool, I let it blow
I just tried to kill another nigga the other day
I just got another half a million up in my bank
Pussy nigga, we ain't never slippin', bitch, what you think?
I got rifles, Dracos, and pistols, blow up a tank
On my lil' boy, nigga


I'm like who want beef? Just show me somethin'
I got killers on Front Street and we ain't runnin'
How I come through, shawty, she don't want no other
Pull up and we thuggin', buckin', clutchin' on them cutters
He say he want smoke with me
We gon' get him knocked off
These bitch niggas don't wan' rock with me
My brothers blow your block down
Travel for that price just like a Greyhound
I don't want you, I got cake now
You wasn't loyal, you couldn't stay down
I don't want you in my way now
