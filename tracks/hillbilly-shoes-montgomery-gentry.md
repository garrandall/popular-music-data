I was there when the men came, and told us all the news
Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Till they walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes

You want to judge me by the whiskey on my breath
You think you know me but you ain't seen nothing yet
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes

You work all day in the muck and the mire
Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire
Ain't too much these boots can't do
Might even kick a little sense into you

Well I'm going up cripple creek going in a run
Going up cripple creek to have a little fun
Law man said they found some tracks
People saw them leavin but they never come back

Oh, you don't know me, you don't know, you don't know you don't know
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes
