I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more
Take me in your arms, rock me, rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while

We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now can't you see that I'm feeling mine
I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped up in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Hold me, darling, before you leave

Take me in your arms, rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darling, rock me, rock me a little while
I'm losing you and all my happiness
My life is over, I got to confess
I'll never see your smiling face no more
I'll never hear your knocking on my door
Before you leave me, baby, leave me behind
Please let me hold you just one more time

Take me in your arms, rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darling, rock me, rock me a little while
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...
I said I never would beg, and I said I wouldn't plead, no
But here I am, baby, baby, baby, please
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby please
Please, please, baby, please
Take me in your arms, rock me, rock me a little while
Hold me, darling, rock me, rock me a little while...
