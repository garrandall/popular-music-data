I love you
You love him
There's nothing I can do
It was in my destiny to fall for you

You say why
Don't I try
To find someone new
It was in my destiny to fall for you

And Theres ain't a thing I can do about it
You know I can't live without it
All I can say is hey, hey, hey, woman!

You say you
Could never give neater
Love that's true
It was in my destiny to fall for you to fall for you
Baby to fall for you
