It's been a long time (pretty, pretty baby)
I'm cryin' (pretty, pretty baby)
For your love I keep tryin' (pretty, pretty baby)
It's been a long time (doo-wah, doo-wah)

It's been a long time (pretty, pretty baby)
We have parted (pretty, pretty baby)
I'm so brokenhearted (pretty, pretty baby)
It's been a long time (doo-wah, doo-wah)

>From the day of our breakup
I've been hopin' that we'll make up
Your love for me I'm tryin' to shake up
Pretty, pretty baby please take my hand

It's been a long time (pretty, pretty baby)
No use denying (pretty, pretty baby)
Your love I've been tryin' to get (pretty, pretty baby)
It's been a long time (doo-wah, doo wah)

Pretty baby
Pretty baby
