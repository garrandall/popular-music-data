Walking through a crowd the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before


Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more the lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors 
Took our broken hearts put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want,
boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more the lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Like any great love it keeps you guessing
Like any real love it's ever changing
Like any true love it drives you crazy
But you wanna change anything anything anything
