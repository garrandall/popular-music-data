When the morning sun promises another wonderful day
And good fortune is all along the way
When you heart is filled with gladness
Cause true love has come to stay

Bringing thrills that we never knew before
When the one you love can show you whats behind that magic door

And twinking of millions bye and bye
When you heart keep taking pictures, that will share as years go by
