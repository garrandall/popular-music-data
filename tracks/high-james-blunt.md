Beautiful dawn
Lights up the shore for me
There is nothing else in the world
I'd rather wake up and see with you
Beautiful dawn
I'm just chasing time again
Thought I would die a lonely man
In endless night


But now I'm high
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me


Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)
Melt with the stars again
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end of time?
Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)
You're just blowing my mind again
Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine


High
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me


Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?
Promise me tomorrow starts with you


Getting high
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
High
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
