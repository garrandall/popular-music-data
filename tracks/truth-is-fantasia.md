Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past
Talked for a while
Asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph


And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you


We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye
And he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that


And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you


Now the truth is it hurts
But I know that the fault is mine
‘Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it
But it's messin' with my mind
(Because I know)



(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you


I just gotta be honest
I guess
I-I guess, I’m still in love, in love, in love
