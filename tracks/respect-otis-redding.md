What you want, honey you got it
And what you need, baby you got it
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when I come home
Hey now, hey hey hey, yeah now

Do me wrong honey, if you wanna
You can do me wrong, honey while I'm gone
But all I'm askin' is for a little respect when I come home
Hey now, hey hey hey, yeah now

Hey little girl, you're so sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
But all I'm askin', hey
Is a little respect when I get home

Hey little girl, you're so sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
But all I'm askin', hey
Is a little respect when I get home

Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need
