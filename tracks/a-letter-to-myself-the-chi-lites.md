(Write a letter, write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
(Write a letter)

I'm sealing up this letter
I just finished signing your name
My friends would all be surprised
If they knew I was playing this game

I'll pretend it's a special delivery
And just to give me a hint
I'll use your favorite color
Smear it with your favorite scent

Huh, I know you think that I'm crazy
But I can't lose, what have I left
So I've decided to write this letter
And send it to myself

So to make my story short
In the mailbox I will place
This letter that I wrote
And it's stamped with your lovely face

When I'm alone
And I need someone to talk to
I talk to your picture
Get me a pencil and paper (pencil and paper)
And write all the things
Say all the things
I've heard you say before
But with a little extra (extra, extra, read all about it)
Sugar and spice
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice

I write a letter (write a letter) to myself (write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh, I write another letter (write a letter) to myself (write a letter)
I write another a letter (write a letter) to myself (write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh, I write another letter (write a letter) to myself (write a letter)

What is a home when you're all alone
It seems so full
(It seems so full) But so empty
(Ah ah ah...)
So I put on my coat
Leave you a note
And go to the places, places, places where we used to be
I pretend you are there
Order dinner for two
Your very presence is all in the air

I write a letter (write a letter) to myself (write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
I write another letter (write a letter) to myself (write a letter)
I write another letter (write a letter) to myself (write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh, I write another letter (write a letter) to myself (write a letter), mmm
