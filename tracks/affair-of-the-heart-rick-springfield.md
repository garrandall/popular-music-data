Heart in my mouth
Pulse in my head 
Mercury rising into the red 
The smell of your skin can
Light up all the fires in me

Hungry to touch
I'm eager to please 
Out of control
And I hand you the keys 
Every night I am burning
To make love to you

But don't try to tell me
you think it's all physical 
It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know 
It's an affair of the heart 
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe 
It's an affair of the heart

When we make love
It's a passionate thing 
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin 
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands

And you got the power
It amazes me still 
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill 
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me
You think it's just physical 
It goes way deeper than that

You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe 
It's an affair of the heart

I'm the controller
And I want to touch you and seize you
And make you mine, hey, hey

Don't try to tell me 
You think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that
You ought to know 
It's an affair of the heart
It's affair of the heart

You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart

You better know 
it's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe 
It's an affair of the heart
