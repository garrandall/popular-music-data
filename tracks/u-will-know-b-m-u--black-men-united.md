Mmm... hm... hm... mmm... hm...
Yeah, yeah

When I was a young boy
I had visions of fame
They were wild and they were free
They were blessed with my name

And then I grew older
And I saw what's to see
That the world is full of pain
And my dreams they left me

And then I got stronger
Inside of the pain
That's when I picked up the pieces
And I regained my name

And I fought hard, y'all
To call by my place
And right now you could ask me
And it all seems in vain

Your dreams ain't easy
You just stick by your plan
Go from boys to men
You gotta act like a man
 When it gets hard, y'all
Got what you know
And my background sing

You will know , yeah... eah...

You will know, you will know

And I know you're cryin'
'Cause it's all in his vein
And the things you want you can't have
It just all went away

But life ain't over
Hoo... hoo...
Just grab the winds and make demands
And the vibe will take you far

Your dreams ain't easy
Stick by your plan, boy
Go from boys to men
I know it ain't easy
 it gets hard sometime
Yes, it does
Stand up tall, don't you fall, and you will know, yeah

Ah... ah... ah... (You will know)
Hey, there's no doubt about it
Hey, you will know

You will know
Hey... ey... hey...
You will know, yeah
 Hey...

Your dreams ain't easy
Stick by your plans
Boys to men
You must act like a man
 It ain't hard, yeah
Grab what you know
Oh... oh... oh...

Hey... hey... yeah
Boys to men
I know it ain't easy
Yeah...
Come on D and sing this song

Yeah...
You will know

Hey...
