You know you're a cute little heart breaker
Foxy
And you know you're a sweet little love-maker yeah

I wanna take you home
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Foxy lady

Look so good

I see you down on the scene
Foxy
You make me wanna stand up and scream
Foxy

I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Foxy lady

Here I come
Comin' to get ya

I'm gonna take you home
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Foxy lady
