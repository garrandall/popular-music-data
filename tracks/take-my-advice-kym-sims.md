(Hey...)

SPOKEN:

"You better hear what I'm sayin'
Just don't let him leave!
You better hear what I'm sayin'"

He called me up on the phone last night
Said he had a few things on his mind
He told me that things just haven't been right
I wonder where he's gonna sleep tonight

Girl, you better wake up
You better change your ways
Before the man is gone
(Hey...)
Girl, you better wise up
And stop playing games
You're going about it wrong
(Hey...)

Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
You must think that good men are a dime a dozen
Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
'Cause if you want to keep him...

(Hey...)

SPOKEN:

"You better hear what I'm sayin'
You better hear what I'm sayin'"

I'm just a friend who's concerned about your feelings
I'd hate to see you lose something so nice
He's at my doorstep with tears runnin' down his face
He wants to talk, he needs more than advice

Girl, you better wake up
You better change your ways
Before the man is gone
(Hey...)
Girl, you better wise up
And stop playing games
You're going about it wrong

(Hey...)

Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
You must think that good men are a dime a dozen
Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
'Cause if you want to keep him
You better give him lovin'

You better, you better lo-ve

(Hey...)

Take my advice
Take my advice

SPOKEN:

"You better hear what I'm sayin'
You better hear what I'm sayin'
You better hear what I'm sayin'
Uh-hm
She's got a smile on her face and a plan in her head"

Girl, you better wake up
You better change your ways
Before the man is gone
(Hey...)
Girl, you better wise up
And stop playing games
You're going about it wrong

(Hey...)

Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
You must think that good men are a dime a dozen
Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
'Cause if you want to keep him
You better give him lovin'

Take my advice
Take my advice

You better, you better lo-
You better, you better lo-
You better, you better lo-ve

SPOKEN:

"You better hear what I'm sayin'
You better hear what I'm sayin'"

(Hey...)

Take my advice
Take my advice
Take my advice
