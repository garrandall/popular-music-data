Oh, I won't let you down. I'll be back
To give all my love to you, Baby, hold on
No you won't fade away. In my mind
You'll be with me every day. Baby, be strong

And just hold on if you're feeling strong
And you'll never find a day.I'm not with you every way
Don't you ever hide away. Our love hold on

But if you let me down.I'll be strong
And give all my love to you. Baby, hold on
'Cause you won't fade away.In my mind
You'll be with me every day.Baby, be strong

And just hold on.If you're feeling strong
And you'll never find a day. I'm not with you every way
Don't you ever hide away.Our love hold on. Baby hold on

But if you ever doubt it. I'll make you so sure about it
'Cause all I ever wanted to do. Is give my lovin' to you
And just hold on. If you're feeling strong
And you'll never find a day.I'm not with you every way
Don't you ever hide away.Our love hold on
