What do I want to do today?
808 Mafia
Um
That boy Cassius

Bad bitch (Bad)
Small waist, pretty face (Pretty)
Havin' my way (Havin', havin')
She let me nut on her face (Eugh)
Stay in your place (Stay in your)
Shut up and stay out the way (Shut up)
Decided what I'm gonna do today (What?)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Don today (Skrrt)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Takeoff)

I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I'ma ghost ride like I'm from the Bay (Bay)
You better watch your bae
Better off doin' what Simon say (Say)
They mad 'cause I copped the Wraith
Police they look at my license plate (12)
They look at my jewelry
When I hop out, start singin' "Amazing Grace" (Grace)
The feast we eat
Before we jump in, my nigga we gotta say grace (got to)
My grandmama gone but can't be replaced (No)
Jenna, she paved the way (Jenna Lou)
I'm turnin' the page on niggas (Turnin')
I waited days, remember? (Remember)
Been had that fame on the side of my hood
Swear it couldn't change a nigga (How?)
You niggas are slow (Slow)
I can beat you runnin' backwards (Backwards)
The way I ghost ride the Wraith
Thought you would've seen Casper (Where)
No I ain't gon' hide the K
'Cause I know I'm who they after (Fuckin' bastard)
How much you charge a feature?
Extra twenty if you askin', gotta tax 'em

Bad bitch (Bad)
Small waist, pretty face (Pretty)
Havin' my way (Havin', havin')
She let me nut on her face (Eugh)
Stay in your place (Stay in your)
Shut up and stay out the way (Shut up)
Decided what I'm gonna do today (What?)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Don today (Skrrt)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Takeoff)

I let her ride the Wraith (C'mon), but she wanna ride the face (Nah)
Ain't give her the car, but I gave her 30K so she can slide and slay (Slay)
These niggas be talkin' 'bout double R Rolls, but that is 2008 (C'mon)
Beep, beep, double R backin' up, get out the way (Get out)
Reclinin' seats (Recline), pressin' one button, massagin' me (Massage me)
I ride with heat (Ride), for all of my niggas deceased (Died)
The pineapple 'scotti, it reek (Ew)
Gelato biscotti, it stink (Ew)
Fuck 12, nigga fast on feet (Fuck 12)
Cartel get the bag dirt cheap (Cartel)
Got gas but the tank on E (Gas)
No flash, but the ice on fleek (No flash)
Walkin' out with the bag and receipt (Walkin' eat)
No clout, all facts when I speak (No clout)
White Wraith with the red and black seats (Wraith)
Pullin' up like a falcon with me (Pullin' up)
She gon' faint when she see the double R (Huh)
When she find out Casper with me (Casper)

Bad bitch (Bad)
Small waist, pretty face (Pretty)
Havin' my way (Havin', havin')
She let me nut on her face (Eugh)
Stay in your place (Stay in your)
Shut up and stay out the way (Shut up)
Decided what I'm gonna do today (What?)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Don today (Skrrt)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Takeoff)
