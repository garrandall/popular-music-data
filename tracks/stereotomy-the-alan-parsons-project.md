Diamond eyes
That burn me and turn me to stone
Crystalise
And freeze me in clear monochrome

Turn me to stone; do anything you want with me
Turn me to stone; do anything you want
Stereotomy
We can make it together
Do anything you want with me
Do anything you want

Scarlet minds
Possess me and I feel no shame
Silent knives
Dissect me and I feel no pain

Stereotomy
We can make it together
Do anything you want with me
Do anything you want

Stereotomy
We can make it forever
Do anything you want with me
Do anything you want

Starlight beams
Project me in red blue and green
Velvet dreams
Protect me when I hit the screen

Stereotomy
We can make it together
Do anything you want with me, do anything you want
Stereotomy
We can make it forever
It's always the same, it's always the same
Stereotomy, we can make it
We can make it, do anything you want

Turn me to stone
Do anything you want with me
Cover my eyes
There's nothing more they need to see
Turn me to stone
Before there's nothing left of me
Make me a rock
And not what I appear to be
Turn me to stone
Turn me to stone
