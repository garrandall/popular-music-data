I can't imagine how to tell my story and, ah
Not fuss or fight, but, I really want to talk to you
You see, I'm not in agreement with the law this morning
So don't be my judge and jury, do I get through to you
But every time I try to build up my case
You tear it down with your pretty face
You stand your ground
And show the lightning in your eyes
And then I feel it


Cool magic wins me over
Oh, so silent, always strong and I tell you
Cool magic wins me over
So, I surrender to your charm


I'm too defensive to give up without a fight
But you know my motions what am I going to do
Although it seems it's never-ending
And I'm desperate
To live right here
Under your spell tonight
And every time I try to build up my case
You tear it down with your pretty face
You stand your ground and
Show the lightning in your eyes
And then I feel it




Just when I feel I'm about to lose my mind
Then here it comes again one more time
I really need it




Cool magic
