When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet
Were fireproof

Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

From the park you hear
The happy sounds of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and
French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

Out of the sun
We'll be having some fun
People walking above
We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk
Boardwalk

Whoa, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be
