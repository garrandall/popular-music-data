You tell me that I'm just a kid
And though that may be true
Amy, oh Amy
I'm still in love with you

You think that you're too old for me
But what's a year or two?
Amy, oh Amy
I'm so in love with you

I'll make you forget that I'm younger than you
If you just let me try
I know you can be oh so happy with me
You don't need an older guy

So come to me and take my hand
The way I dreamed you'd do
Amy, oh Amy
I'm so in love with you

Amy, oh Amy
Amy, oh Amy
Oh Amy
