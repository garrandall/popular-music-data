Gonna leave the city put my troubles behind
People in the city goin' out of their minds
Goin' to the country just to feel like gold
People in the country really let themselves go

Hey, ho, one thing I know
People in the country got one thing for sure
Hey, ho, one thing I know
Every mother's child really lets himself go

Goin' to the country and leavin' right away
No time to talk I got to make a getaway
Gonna leave the city it's a crime and a shame
People in the city are goin' insane

Hey, ho, one thing I know
Every mother's child really lets himself go
Hey, ho, one thing I know
People in the country really let themselves go

Joining hands
Making plans
Come on down
Look around
