I was walking down the street
In a little old country town
I saw a rusty penny
Half buried in the ground

As I bent down to pick it up
I saw beneath the rust
These words, just barely visible
In God we trust

I held it for a moment
Then suddenly, I knew
What God in all his wisdom
Would have me say and do

He used this worthless penny
To make me understand
That life is not worthing living
Without the master's hand


Oh, in God we trust
In God we trust
We're lost just like this penny
Unless in God we trust

And then, I heard a
Still small voice whispering
Within me, very clear
Be still and know that I am God
And I'm always near

When all your dreams come
Tumbling around you in the dust
Remember this lost penny
And place in me, your trust
