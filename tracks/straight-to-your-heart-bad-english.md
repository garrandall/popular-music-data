I can't reach behind your eyes
You always look away
You hide behind your alibis
And change your mind
From day to day
If there's something I can do
Then I'll be there
Outside your broken world
You'll see it's me who cares
Take me straight to your heart
Cause this time's real
And real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause you know
I've been there before
Straight to your heart
I watch you move
And I watch you dance
I watch you drift away
And I'd give anything for you
And you know that's bad
When it gets that way
You can't go on like this
And I don't wanna fight again
I don't give a damn anymore

Right or wrong you're gonna let me in
Straight to your heart
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause you know I've been there before
Straight to your heart this time this time
Baby I know where you are
Cause you know I've been there before
Then maybe I'll break down the walls
And my love will go
Straight to your heart
Inside
Take me inside yeah
Straight to your heart
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are
Cause this time we're goin' all the way
Straight to your heart
This time
This time
Baby it's straight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
This time it's straight to your heart
Oh yeah
Cause this time it's real
