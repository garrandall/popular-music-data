After all this time I still miss you everyday
The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change

When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change

I still love you
