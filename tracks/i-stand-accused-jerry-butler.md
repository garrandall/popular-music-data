I stand accused.
Of lovin' you,
Too much.

And I hope,
I hope it's not a crime.
'Cause if it is,
I'm guilty,
Of lovin' you, you, you.

Oh yeah, mmm hm.

I - I hope to God that I,
Never have,
To Testify.
'Cause if I do,
Everyone is gonna, they're gonna cry,
They're gonna say,
(Guilty)

? Is guilty,
Of lovin' a sweet girl like you.

I know, I know,
You belong to another.
I
I may not stand a ghost of a chance.
I'll stand on top of Mt. Everest,
And proudly tell the world that I love ya.
Oh yes I will.

Because I
I just can't,
I can't help it girl.
I'm a victim of circumstance.

And just one.
Oh, one touch of your hand.
I don't know how it happened.
But just look at me,
I find myself chillin' on the witness stand.

And I'm shouting out,
All over... all over the land.
Yes if I'm guilty then...
(Guilty)
I'm guilty, guilty of loving you.

I'm guilty,
Of loving you, yeah.
I said I'm guilty,
For? do.

I wanna hold ya.
I wanna squeeze ya tight.
But?
Belong to another,
And that ain't right...
