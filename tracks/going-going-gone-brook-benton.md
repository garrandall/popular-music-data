Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes

You know it takes a lot of kissin' (tell me about it)
To make a romance sweet
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes

I said, mm, mm, mm...
You know you've got just what it takes!

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do" (oh, yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes

Ah, ah... mm, mm...
You know you've got just what it takes!

Because it takes, oh yeah
"You're back in my spot again, honey"
"I like your spot"
To stay away from you
"I can't stay away from you"
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true
Now it's you
But, it takes somebody special
Like me, baby
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you've got what it takes

"C'mon, let's play it again, huh?"
"C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?"
And baby, you've got what it takes
"One more time, Brook"
"Ah-ha, OK, ah-ha"
And baby, you've got what it takes
