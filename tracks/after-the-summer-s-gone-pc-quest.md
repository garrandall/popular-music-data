These last few weeks with you
Have been the best of my life
And it's a cold winter's night
That we'll be saying goodbye
When you're all alone somewhere
On a cold winter's day
Remember these warm summer nights
And the promises that we made

I'll be missing you
After September
I'll be wanting you
So always remember
How I loved you girl
After the summer's gone

So dry your eyes for me
Before I start to cry
I can tell you that life isn't fair
But I still can't tell you why

I'll be missing you
After September
I'll be wanting you
So always remember
How I loved you girl
After the summer's gone

In a world that's as big as ours
It's amazing we met, yeah
I have a feeling that we'll meet again
Til then, never forget

I'll be missing you



(After the summer's gone)
Oh
(After the summer's gone)
After the summer's gone
(After the summer's gone)
Missing you girl
(After the summer's gone)
I'll still be, I'll still be
Wanting you near
(After the summer's gone)
After the summer's gone
(After the summer's gone)
Oh
(After the summer's gone)
Saying goodbye
After the summer's gone
