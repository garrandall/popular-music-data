I'm no angel, it's hard to hide,
Got a rebel mouth and a ticket to ride
I'm no angel, but I'm not so tough
The boys in the town are gonna treat you rough

They're all heroes in the darkness
When they talk in the street
They can make anything dirty
That's supposed to be sweet

I'm no angel, not a slave to love
But this pain in my heart, it fits me like a glove
The world keeps turning, I can't stand still
Something gonna save me, I know it will

And I hear it in the darkness
When I let myself go
I can hear it in my heart
And I just wanna know

What's that sound, well it knocked me down
I wanna be a rock 'n' roll girl
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world
If it calls and it calls every boy and girl
It's a heartache heard round the world
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world

I'm not crazy, well maybe I am
'Cause I just wanna sing like Bobby Blue Bland
And if I'm dreaming don't you wake me up
'Cause life's too short and I can't get enough

I feel it in the darkness
When I let myself go
There's just something inside us
And I just wanna know

What's that sound, well it knocked me down
I wanna be a rock 'n' roll girl
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world
If it calls and it calls every boy and girl
It's a heartache heard round the world
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world

Can you hear it in the darkness
When you let yourself go
I can hear it in my heart
And I just wanna know

What's that sound, well it knocked me down
I wanna be a rock 'n' roll girl
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world
If it calls and it calls every boy and girl
It's a heartache heard round the world
What's that sound
It's a heartache heard round the world
