You keep looking at me
While you dance in another's arms
And you pretend to be
So enchanted with all his charms

Revenge, revenge
Is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge
Now come back to my arms

You keep telling your friends
Only heartaches I gave to you
And you hope in the end
That my heart will be crying, too

Revenge, revenge
Is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge
Now come back to my arms

Maybe you want me
To get down on my knees to you
Well, I'll do it gladly, darling
If that's what pleases you

But you got to tell me tonight
You'll give our love a brand-new start
For you've had your delight
With just tearing my heart apart

Revenge, revenge
Is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge
Now come on back to my arms

I'm waiting, revenge, revenge
Is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge
Now come back to my arms

Revenge, revenge
Is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge
Now come back to my arms
