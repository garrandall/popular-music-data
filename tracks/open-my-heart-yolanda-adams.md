Mmm, oh, talk to me
Ohhh, oh, oh, talk to me


Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
'Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if I choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you


So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my mind is so cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart (oo yes)


My hopes and dreams
Are fading fast
I'm all burned out
And I don't think my strength's gonna last
So I'm crying out
Crying out to you
Lord, I know that you're the only one
Who is able to pull me through


So I know I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my world seems so cloudy, Lord
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart (oh yeah, yes I do)


So show me how
To do things your way
Don't let me make the same mistakes
Over and over again
Your will be done
And I'll be the one
To make sure that it's carried out
And in me, I don't want any doubt
That's why...


I wanna talk to you (yes I do)
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my world seems just a little bit cloudy
Lord, you, you can guide me through
That's why I open up
I open up my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart

Oh, all I need to do is just hear a single word from you

I open up
I open up
Open up my heart

Just one word could make a difference in what I do, Lord
Guide me until I'm sure
I open
I open
I open
I open my heart

You just say one word, one word, one word, one word, one word
I open up
I open up
Open up my heart to you, to you
You're the lover of my soul
The captain of my sea
I need a word from you
That's why I open up my heart
