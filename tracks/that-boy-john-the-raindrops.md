Who knew that so many people,
Could be at the same place at the same time?
Who knew that so many people,
Could wear the same face as I?
Who knew that only the second day,
Would bring me a slew of fear?
Who knew I'd fall right into,
The trap that I set last year?

I wanted to shed my skin
And just be a new man
And if anyone's prone to fall
God, I should know that I am

Raindrops outside my window
Remind me of when I was a boy
When love seemed to be real
And not just a children's toy
When it's so easy to throw away
Why can't I just let it stay
Instead of breathing it in
Just like routine
And then out again

I wanted to shed my skin
And just be a new man
And if anyone's prone to fall
God, I should know that I am

I wanted to shed my skin
And just be a new man
And if anyone's prone to fall
God, I should know that I am
