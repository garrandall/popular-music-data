Ba-bow DIT
Ba-bow DIT
That boy John
(Ba-bow DIT SHOO doo)
Well he looks so good when he walks on by,
All the girls try to catch his eye...
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh
I can hardly believe
(I can hardly believe)
That he's goin' with me.

I tell ya that boy John
(Ba-bow DIT SHOO doo)
When he holds me tight
And he says he's mine,
He sends those chills up and down
My spine.
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh WHOA-oh
He's the handsomest boy
(He's the handsomest boy)
That I ever did see.

Some boys make you cry,
Kiss you once and make you cry.
Some boys put you on,
Yeah (YEAH)
YEAHHH! (YEAHHH!)

But that boy John
(Ba-bow DIT SHOO doo)
When he says to me
Baby, I love you,
I just know
Every word is true.
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh
He's the boy that I love,
(He's the boy that I love,)
And I told him I do.

Well he's gooood to me,
That boy John is-a good to me,
And he's gooood to me,
Sweet and kind as a-he can be,
And he's gooood to me...
