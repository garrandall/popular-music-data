Ohio, Ohio, Ohiooooo 

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go 

I'd rather be at home with ray 
I ain't got seventy days 
Cuz there's nothing 
There's nothing you can teach me 
That I can't learn from mr hathaway 

I didn't get a lot in class 
But I know it don't come in a shot glass 

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go 

The man said 'why do you think you here' 
I said 'I got no idea' 
'I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby 
So I always keep a bottle near' 
He said 'I just think your depressed, 
This me "Yeah, baby, and the rest" 

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know... 

I don't never wanna drink again 
I just ooooh I just need a friend 
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks 
Have everyone think I'm on the mend 

It's not just my pride 
It's just til these tears have dried 

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said 'no no no' 
Yes I've been black, but when I come back you'll know know know 
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
They tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go
