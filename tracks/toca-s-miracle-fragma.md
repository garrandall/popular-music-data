If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say 
I feel your touch
Your kiss, it's not enough 
And if you believe in me 
Don't think my love's not for real
I won't take nothin' less then a deeper love 


Let me tell you, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Let me tell you, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through

Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayer
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me
