Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading
Girl, it's fading away from me
Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Oh baby, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Oh baby, I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurtin', downhearted and worried girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me

Oh, it's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Oh baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness inside
Oh I can tell I'm losing you
Oh
I don't wanna lose you

Oh I can tell when we kiss
From the tenderness I miss
Oh little girl, I'm losing you
Girl, I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be gone
Oh baby, I'm losing you
Oh my dear
What happened to the love we shared?
Oh baby, I'm losing you
I know it's true
There's someone new
Oh baby, baby, baby, I'm losing you
