We live in the modern age 
Where love is fast like a turning page 
In a magazine, we've hardly seen 
The friends we used to know 
They disappear, they come and go 
Like the times we've had 
It's kind of sad 

Whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would see you through 
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew 
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would last through the years 
Through the trials 
Through the smiles 
Through the tears 

Today is all we've planned 
We say tomorrow we'll understand 
If it all should end 
We'd be alone again 

Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would see you through 
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew 
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would last through the years 
Through the trials 
Through the smiles 
Through the tears 

For now the tenderness 
Has been replaced 
With something less 
And it's hard to find 
What we left behind 

Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would see you through 
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew 
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love 
The kind that would last through the years 
Through the trials 
Through the smiles 
Through the tears.
