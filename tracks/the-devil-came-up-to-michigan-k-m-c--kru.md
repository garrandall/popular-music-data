The Devil came up to Michigan, he was lookin' for a soul to steal
He had trouble in mind, as he drove on the line, he was looking to make a deal
He had a brand new Nissan truck, convertible, with a portable phone
He had a Kenwood deck that was bumpin' loud as he stopped in a no-parking zone
The Devil stepped out with a beeper on his hip, a black Fila suit that was down
But then he turned his head when his eyes got red when he heard this scratchin' sound
He walked up on a boy on two turntables, this boy was rippin' the cut
So the Devil jumped up on the back of his truck and said, "Boy, let me tell you what:
You rock the beat pretty good boy, but naw, it ain't nothin' new
Cause I'm in yo' town, 'bout to take that crown, and ain't nothin' that you can do!
But if you wanna get bad, don't make me mad, we can make this little bet true
A turntable of gold against your soul, I think I'm better than you!"

The boy said, "My name's 'The Butcher' and I'm the baddest around in this city
You start messin' with me and I'm sure you'll see you're gonna feel real itty-itty-bitty
But I'll take that bet and you're gonna regret," and then The Butcher started flexin' his wrist
But then the Devil's posse all jumped in, then they broke it on down like this:

Hit it!

Devil's in the House!


When the Devil got done scratchin' everyone knew he wasn't no joke
Because his records caught on fire, the turntables went up in smoke
The Devil's posse got in a circle and gave each other high-fives
They thought The Butcher had lost; party-party time to get live!
The Butcher started stretchin', he yawned and looked at the Devil
Then he dropped his arms down by his side and kind of giggled and laughed at the fellow
He had some Double Mint gum so he put it in his mouth, I guess he enjoyed the taste
But then he threw the gum wrapper in the Devil's face and stepped back and hollered out, "Bass!"


The Devil bowed his head because he knew he had been beat
So he laid that fresh turntable of gold down by The Butcher's feet
The Butcher told the Devil to get out of town then he laughed dead in his face
Then The Butcher started cuttin' all over again, stepped back and hollered out, "Bass!"
