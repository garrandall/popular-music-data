It's been a blue blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from it all
My love has been untrue she's found somebody new it's been a blue blue day for me
Well I feel like crying dying what can I do
I feel like praying saying I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from the blues

Yes how can I make believe that I don't sit and grieve it's been a blue blue day for me
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway it's been a blue blue day for me
Well I feel like crying...
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
