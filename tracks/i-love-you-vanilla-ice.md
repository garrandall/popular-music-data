Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel
When I'm in your arms, gives me a chill
Just knowin' that you want me by your side
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride
Girl, I need you more and more each day
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile


I love you, 'cause I love you
I love you, 'cause I love you


You're so fine, let's wine and dine
I'm so happy that you are mine
Thinking of you, I melt with desire
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher
To hear you talk sounds so sweet
When you're close to me I feel your heat
Girl, I want you and you want me
And it'll last until eternity
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky
So clean, like the look in your eye
You're my queen, I'll buy you everything
Yes, girl, even diamond rings
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true
Every sunset makes me think of you
And I'll never forget what you mean to me
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla I-C-E

Chorus


Hello girl, when I first saw you, it was love at first sight. We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same
I know I haven't said it much before. Well. It's because, see, I get all choked up inside, it just doesn't wanna. Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad things I've done. So, no matter what goes on, no matter what happens, always remember: I love you
