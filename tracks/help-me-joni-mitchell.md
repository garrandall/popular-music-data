Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good

Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom
