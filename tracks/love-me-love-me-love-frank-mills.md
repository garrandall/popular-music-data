Standing on a corner
Passing time away
I thought I heard an organ grinder
Singing as he played
He had a little monkey
With a little cup of tin
And he danced for joy
Hen someone put a penny in

He sang, love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go

I couldn't help but wonder
How the old man got his song
What a tragic tale of loneliness
How fate had done him wrong
Whatever made the old man
Want to brave the cold and rain
And tell the world his story
'Til death could ease the pain

He sang, love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go

I went back to the corner
Just to hear the old man play
A policeman said the old man died
One cold November day
I waited for a minute
Then sadly walked away
Though I couldn't see the old man
I'm sure I heard him play

He sang, love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go
