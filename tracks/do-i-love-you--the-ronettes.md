Here I am on bended knees
I lay my heart down at your feet
Now do I love you

All you have to do is ask
I'll give until there's nothing left
Do I love you

As long as there is life in me
Your happiness is guaranteed
I'll fill your heart with ecstasy, forever darling

Do I love you?
Do I love you?
Do I love you?
Indeed I do Indeed I do

The very thing that I want most
Is just to have and hold you close
Do I love you?

From early morning until late at night
You fill my heart with pure delight
Do I love you?

Whenever I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
And bring you home safe to me, for ever darling

Do I love you?
Do I love you?
Do I love you?

Indeed I do, sweet darling, indeed I do

Now whenever I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
And bring you home safe to me
For ever darling

Do I love you?
Do I love you?
Do I love you?
Indeed I do, little darling, indeed I do
