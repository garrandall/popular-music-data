Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Back here at home there's nothin' to do, oh
Now that I'm away
I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in


When you looked at me I should've run
But I thought it was just for fun
I see I was wrong
And I'm not so strong
I should have known all along that time would tell


A week without you
Thought I'd forget
Two weeks without you and I still haven't gotten over you yet


Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone


A week without you
Thought I'd forget
Two weeks without you and I still haven't gotten over you yet


Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone


Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
