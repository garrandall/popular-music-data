And when I told her
I didn't love her anymore
She cried (she cried)
And when I told her
Her kisses were not like before
She cried (she cried)
I thought that our romance was over and done
But to her it had just begun

And when I told her
Another girl had caught my eye
She cried (she cried)
And when I kissed her
A kiss that only meant goodbye
She cried (she cried)

------ strings ------

(Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la)

And when I told her
I didn't love her anymore
She cried (she cried)
