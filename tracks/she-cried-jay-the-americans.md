She doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want my kisses
I know that this is it for me

She doesn't want me anymore
Somehow my touch just misses
I know that this is it for me

So turn on the sun, I need the sunlight
Need it's glow to make things bright
Without her, every day is black as night

And bring out the moon, I need the moonlight
Brighter than it's ever shone
She is gone and I am so alone

But she cried for me, when she cried for me
Yes she cried for me, yes she cried for me
And she could've laid down and died for me

She doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want my kisses
I know that this is it for me

This is it, goodbye my love
This is it, and so long my little girl
This is it, and I know, I know, I know
This is it, that this is it for me
