I stood watching all night long
I stood watching all night long
I stood watching till you went away
You were a girl of many charms
Oh, how I loved you in my arms
I never thought that you'd ever go
'Cause I loved you so

Oh, uh, Susie darlin'
I thought you knew
You were all the world to me
All my dreams come true

I stand crying all night long
I stand crying all night long
Knowing that life has nothing left for me-ee
I'll walk around most patiently
Hoping you will return to me
Till that happy day I will always be
Watching all night long

Oh, uh, Susie darlin'
I thought you knew) I thought you knew)
You were all the world to me
All my dreams come true

Oh, uh, Susie darlin' (I thought you knew)
Oh, uh, Susie darlin' (I thought you knew)
Oh, uh, Susie darlin' (I thought you knew)
