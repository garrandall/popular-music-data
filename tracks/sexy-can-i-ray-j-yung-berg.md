Sexy can I
Yeah, Yeah
All we wanna know is....


Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, hit it from the front,
then I hit it from the back.
know you like it like that.
then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
then we chill for a second, then we're back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.


What's up Lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dippin, Lui Vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (oh) when a nigga go by.
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the chi.
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since.


Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, keep it on the low.
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo.
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo.
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo.
(Oh,oh,oh) Now look shawty, look shawty.
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh,oh,oh)
(I don't know what your man is like but shawty all I want to know is...)
sexy can I.

Sexy can I, visit you at work

When you sliding down the pole,
no panties, no shirt.
Then you climb back up the pole,
then you drop and do the splits.
How you make that pussy talk,
Baby damn, you is the shit
(Oh,oh,oh) Now look shawty, look shawty.
I make it rain in the club like (Oh,oh,oh)
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is...)
Sexy can I

Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.


I don't care who's ya boy hittin, or who Ray's melon
When I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin'
See I'm a go get and she a go get
You already know she...
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I send for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
just let it air dry.
And if you ain't fuckin' tonight
Man you can watch that tour bus go by
