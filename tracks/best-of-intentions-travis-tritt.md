I had big plans for our future,
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise,
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle,
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser,
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner,
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember,
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along


I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do

But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
to show my love for you.
And if you could read my heart,
then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions


So here I am asking forgiveness,
and praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted,
girl I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better,
you won't find devotion more true
Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl I've had the best of intentions,
Yes, I've had the best of intentions
loving you
