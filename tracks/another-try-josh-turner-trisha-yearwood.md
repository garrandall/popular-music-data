All the things I felt and never shared
All the times she was lonely with me there
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes
And how I let her go without a fight


The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try


There is no changing things that we regret
The best that we can hope for is one more chance
If the hands of time could just move in reverse
I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her

The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try

The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try


Oh if love ever gives me another try
