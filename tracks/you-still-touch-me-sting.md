Another night finds me alone
In my dreams
You still touch me
Your picture by my telephone
In that smile
You still thrill me
And if I sleep
I sleep here alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
And if I'm falling
I'm falling like a stone
In my nightmares
You still hold me


And after all that we've been through
Now I'm wondering
If you still blame me
If only half of this was true
That you believe of me
You still shame me


Dark rain will fall until I see your face
I close my eyes
I seem to hear the raindrops saying
You won't come back
You still touch me


And when I'm sick at heart and low
In my prayers
You still heal me
When I'm so sure, so sure this isn't so
In my complacency
You still shake me


I wonder if you feel the same way as I do
And you'd come back
You still touch me


Another night finds me alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
You still hold me
You still touch me
You still touch me
You still touch me
Another night
Another night
Another night
Another night finds me alone
