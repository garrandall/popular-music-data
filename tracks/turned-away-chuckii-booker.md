Turned away, turned away
Turned away, turned away
From love

Too many times I feel
We are losing time once shared
And only when you're in ecstasy
You seem to really care

Didn't you say not to worry
I can only speak for myself
How do you think that I'm happy, baby
With a love like mine
Locked up on a shelf

Remember my love had a place
It was a part of the game
And just when I went all the way
I'm in too deep
Girl, you made the choice
And sent away

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)

I discovered you were untrue
So unfortunate for you
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I only gave you the best
I ever had to you

Don't let sympathy show her face
Girl, let's not pretend
I'm no longer in this race
You've got your space
Still it hurts me that you

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)
Don't turn away from my love
(Turned away from my love)
(Turned away from my love)

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)

Turned away from love

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)
Don't turn away from my love
(Turned away from my love)
(Turned away from my love)

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)

Turned away, turned away
Turned away, turned away
