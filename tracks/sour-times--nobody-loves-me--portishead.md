To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now


'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do


Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now


'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do


Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times


'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do


After time, the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide


'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you
Nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do
