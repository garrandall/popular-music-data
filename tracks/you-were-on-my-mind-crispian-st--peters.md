Well I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
I said you were on my mind

Oh, I got troubles, oh, oh
I got worries, oh, oh
I got wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
I said just to ease my pain

Oh, I got troubles, oh, oh
I got worries, oh, oh
I came home again

But I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
You were on my mind

Oh, I got troubles, oh, oh
I got worries, oh, oh
I got wounds to bind

But I've got a feeling
Yeah, down in my shoes
I said way down in my shoes

Well, I gotta ramble, oh, oh
I gotta move on, oh, oh
I gotta walk away my blues

When I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
I said you were on my mind

Well, I got troubles, oh, oh
I got worries, oh, oh
I got wounds to bind, yeah
