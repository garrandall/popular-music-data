I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said child just once more


I chose you for the one
Now we're havin' so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind


You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you
Came into my life


The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you


'Cause you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at



Thank you, baby
Yeah yeah


I love you so much you see
You're even in my dreams
I can hear
Baby, I can hear you calling me
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you baby, thank you baby



You made me so very happy
You made me so, so very happy
I'm so glad you
Came into my life


Mmm, I want to thank you, girl
Every day of my life
I wanna thank you
You made me so very happy
Oh, I wanna spend my life thanking you
Thank you baby, thank you baby
Thank you baby thank you baby
