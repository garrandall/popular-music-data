Ooh, I love my baby
I said I love, love
Love my baby

Ooh, I love
I love, I love my baby
I said I love, love
Love my girl

There's a lot of girls
With their eyes on me
Can't you see that I'm as happy
As a man could ever be

When I was lonely
They never looked my way
But now that I am happy
They're trying to make me stray

But I'm the kind of guy
Who only needs one girl
And I don't care just what they do
I shout out out loud
And tell the whole world

Oh, I love my baby
Love my baby
I said I love, love
Love my girl

Without my baby, I'm like
A ship that's lost at sea
She's my navigator
She's the only one who guides me

Don't you girls underestimate
This love we share
And no matter what you do
My love ain't going nowhere

She's the kind of girl
Who only needs one guy
In her, I found satisfaction
That's the reason why

Oh, I love, I love my baby
I love that little girl, oh, yeah
I said I love my girl

She's the kind of girl
Who only needs one guy
And I'm the kind of guy
Who only needs one girl

Oh, I love my baby
Love my baby, oh, yeah
I love, I love, love that girl

I said I love
Oh, I love my baby
I said I love, love
Love, love that girl...
