Can't you feel it,
(Baby, baby)
Can't you feel it,
(Baby, baby)

Baby, can you see?
That the river is wide,
The river is long, now.
The water gets deep,
As our love gets strong, now.

Oh baby don't fight,
Girl all tonight,
You belong to me.

Up on the roof,
We heard the gentle rain.
With the rythm of,
Our heartbeats,
Down it came.

As it hit each rock,
He washed away the pain.
Can stop one drop of rain.

That the river is wide,
The river is long, now.
The water gettin' deep,
As our love gets strong, now.

Oh baby don't fight,
Girl all tonight,
You belong to me.

It's too late to turn the tide, baby.
It's too late to hide away, baby.
It's too late for? denying today.

That the river is wide,
The river is long, now.
The water gets deep,
As our love gets strong, now.

Oh baby don't fight,
Girl all tonight,
You belong to me.

That the river is wide,
The river is long, now.
The water runs deep,
As our love gets strong, now.

Oh baby don't fight,
Girl all tonight,
You belong to me.

And the river gets wide,
The river gets long, now.
The water runs deep,
As our love gets strong, now.
