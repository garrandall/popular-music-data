One thing 'bout this heart of mine
All my hurts got a mending time
It don't leave no scars behind 
I'll get over you
I'll find me a guy one day
Who's not scared to give his heart away
When I do It's safe to say that I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you

From now on think Ill lay low
I'll talk fast but Ill move slow
You taught me all I need to know
'bout gettin over you
Sometimes I think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
But I know its just until I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you

Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
Love for you's so hard to kill
But I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new 
When I get over you
