I'm done hating myself for feeling
I'm done crying myself awake
I've gotta leave and start the healing
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay
What have I become? Looking through your phone now, oh now
Love to you is just a game
Look what I have done, dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break, baby

How do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, I...
My love will keep you up tonight

Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm sticking 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself
Look what I've done
Dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break, baby

How do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, I...
My love will keep you up tonight
Baby, I...
My love will keep you up tonight

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby
