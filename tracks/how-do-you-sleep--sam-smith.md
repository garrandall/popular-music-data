I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay


What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break


Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight


(Tell me, how do you—)
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me, how do you—)


Oh, no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself


Look what I have done (Done)
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break


Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight


(Tell me how do you—)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)
Oh, love will keep you up tonight


Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (Oh)
All that fear and all that pressure (Oh)
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)
