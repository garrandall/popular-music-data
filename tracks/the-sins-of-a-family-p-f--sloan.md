She had a bad childhood while she was very young
So don't judge her too badly
She had a schizophrenic mother who worked in the gutter
Would have sold herself to the devil gladly
What a sad environment, a bug-ridden tenement
And when they couldn't pay the rent
It was 'cause her father was out gettin' sicker
Ah, the stone's been cast and blood's thicker than water

And the sins of the family fall on the daughter
All the sins of the family fall on the daughter

At the age of 16 she had been around
More than any girl over 30
And the high IQ's who condemned her knew
She was a product of poor heredity, yeah
It's a fictitious fact
When you fall on your back
You can backtrack failure with inspection
Without exception

All the sins of the family fall on the daughter
All the sins of the family fall on the daughter

Oh, the devil is open to all of us
Heaven selects just a precious few
And it takes some inside pull to get
Gabriel make an angel out of you
One can't live a lie then expect to die
With a soul in paradise
You know you gotta pay the price
Like you ought, blood's thicker than water

And the sins of the family fall on the daughter
All the sins of the family fall on the daughter
