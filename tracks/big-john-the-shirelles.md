(Big John, Big John)

Big John, won't you come on home?
Ain't you gonna marry me?
My folks all want to know
When the wedding's gonna be
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
Been waitin' so long
There's somethin' goin' wrong

Big John, if you don't come home
I'm gonna have to leave this place
My folks know you've jilted me
I'm ashamed to show my face
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
Been waitin' so long
There's somethin' goin' wrong

They all told me 'bout the things you do
If what they told me is true
They all said that I'd soon find out
I'm wastin' my kisses on you

There's somethin' goin' wrong

They all told me 'bout the things you do
If what they told me is true
They all said that I'd soon find out
I'm wastin' my kisses on you

Big John, if you don't come home
I'm gonna have to leave this place
My folks know you've jilted me
I'm ashamed to show my face
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
Been waitin' so long
There's somethin' goin' wrong

(Big John)
Been waitin' so long
(Big John)
There's somethin' goin' wrong
(Big John)
