We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
Bein' on the bottom line
Sure ain't no fun

But if we should be evicted
Huh, from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on

Oh

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Oh, ah, baby

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) oh oh

(Chorus)
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

Ah...

Now we may not know, huh
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come

Ah
Boy I want to thank you
Yeah, for loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day

Oh yeah
(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Oh, oh

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) won't be long
Oh yeah

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
Oooo oh oh

(spoken)

Talk about the only way is up, baby
Talk about the only way

Talk about the only way is up, baby
Talk about the only way
Talk about the only way is up, baby

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Hey

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) won't be long
No no no

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now...
