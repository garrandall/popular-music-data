(Intro)
(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus causing them to move around more frequently they may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviours)

(Verse One)
Go on tell me what you know about me
That is what I thought
You listen to the talk
But ain’t nobody ever hear me squawk
All of y'all are quick to hate but y'all gon ' love me when I finally meet the chalk
Watch what I make
Every thing I create
Everything that I touch
I don't need to sling no mud
I don't need a crutch
Ima let the success speak
What the fucks a grudge
Everything you've ever said about me is about to come undone
Acting like I haven't changed
Four passed and you're stuck in the past and you saying that its me to blame
Damn, I moved 500 miles away
Took my life back from the sauce
Reap what you sow and I came to close to being another corpse
Swapped the lines on a dvd case
To bind these lines in a cd case
Traded taps on these bar for these bars on tap
But my drip still finna needa a tray
Ay
Cos I'm either spitting or about to spray
I won't dance around the matter I don't do ballet
If you know me then you know I will say it to your face
Impulsive motherfucker I can't hold it in
Im about to ‘xplode again
Woo
I don't give a fuck about you
Heres front row, enjoy what I do
(Damn what a view)
God damn what a view
So glad so proud - I ain 't one of you
Ima pray straight to the clouds in the pew
The only way to let the demons out it to set the demons loose
If we all sitting ducks tell me who the fucks picking goose
I will
My days are grey
And I take it out on bae
Cos I'm para that she won't stay
Either way I'm pushing her away
When I wanna hold her close
Im so sorry but even in the best of times we don't have the dough so I don't see the need to toast
Far from a chicken but ima give you roast
Cooking up the heat tho I don't like to boast
If a woman 's place in the kitchen ima make my self at home
Kick my feet up while I'm rolling up a cone
Hit it sit back and I'm riding this
Feel this beat n its facts that I body this
Drop to my feet and ill know where nobody is
I drop a tweet everybody got burning ears
As they say if the boots fits thats the furnishing
Right this shit down you would benefit from learning this
Chose not to fuck you over like I didn't know what virgin is
Yet you painted me to be the villain come and tell me to my face what your version is
Im telling you you raped
Every avenue I paved
Everything that I gave
It was all take take take
And I know a yungen that would say the same
We the fam that you claimed
‘Cept when crunch time came
Ego set so big can't except no blame
What a joke ima have to pop another bubble you a no name
Don't take it hard man I'm the same
When its all said and done I just pray
That the life's for everyone around me will change
Have em feeling like this part weren 't a chapter it was just a page
Ay
I write what I 'm living
If you don 't like it turn the shit off don 't cross my path
Right now this is what i 'm living
Snakes in the grass
I don 't need a lawnmower to get to killin '
I don 't know whether to make heads or tails I don 't know what i 'm feeling
But i 'm bouta paint the ceiling with the blood of every single villain
While I reel in just desserts that 's a million
I ain 't trippin '
I ain 't rippin '
Im just flowing like I never took a Ritalin
Yh I know I'm sickening
I can't help it tho
This is what I'm living
