Yeah, yeah,
It's got to be mellow,
Got to be mellow,

'Cause my baby loves me,
And I'm her only fellow.
Crazy about my baby,
Crazy about my baby,
And it's plain to see
She's crazy about me,
Crazy bout me, yeah.

She's got class
And she's got style,
A personality that drives me wild,
She's not a put-on
And she's not make believe,
She don't mind sharing love so that she may receive.

She's mellow
Yes my baby's mellow,
And oh yeah,
And I'm her only fellow.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

It's got to be mellow
Got to be mellow,
'Cause my baby loves me
And I'm her only fellow
Crazy about my baby,
Crazy about my baby,
And it's plain to see
She's crazy about me,
Crazy bout me, yeah.
She's alright,
Love is uptight.
