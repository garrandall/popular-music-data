Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll


If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me


Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic


(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
