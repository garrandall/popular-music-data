People sure act funny
When the get a little money
Yes, they do, y'all

Sure act funny
When the get a little money
Yes, they do, y'all

I knew you when you had to live in a hut
You made your livin' by the cane you cut
Now you're livin' on easy street
You passed me by, you don't wanna speak

People sure do holler
When they get hold to a dollar
Yes, they do, y'all

Sure do holler
When they get hold to a dollar
Yes, they do man

I knew you when you didn't have no shoes
The whole family sang the low-down blues
Now you're pretty like a Jess and Jack
Your pockets are sold, we ain't get it back

People sure do squeal
When they get a dollar bill
Yes, they do, man

Sure do squeal
When they get a dollar bill
Yes, they do, y'all

I knew you when you were my friend
I stuck to you through the thick and thin
You hit another then you put me down
I'm here to tell you: "Chase to turn around"

People sure act mean
When they get a massive queen
Yes, they do, y'all

Sure act mean
When they get a massive queen
Yes, they do, man

I'd known you when you didn't have a dime
We'll be together all of the time
Now I'm back to a millionair
You can be far more aware

People sure act funny
When the get a little money
Yes, they do, y'all

Sure act funny, man
When they get some money
I don't want you to have 'em
I'm gonna get out of this town and find you some money

What about you, man?
Everybody sure act funny
When they get a little money
