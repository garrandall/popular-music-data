Ave Maria

She said: "My daughter, I beg of you
I have a with that must come true
The last thing you can do for Mama
Please promise me that you will stay
And take my place while I'm away
And give the children love each day"
I had to cry, what could I say?

How hard I tried to find the words
I prayed she wouldn't see my cry
So much to say that should be heard
But only time to say goodbye to Mama

They say in time that you'll forget
Yet still today my eyes are wet
I tell myself to smile for Mama
Now soon there'll be another spring
And I will start remembering
The way she loved to hear me sing
Her favorite song, "Ave Maria"

Ave Maria

The children have all grown up now
I kept my promise to Mama
I cannot guide them anymore
I've done my best all for Mama

Ave Maria

But still it seems so very small
For all she did for me
