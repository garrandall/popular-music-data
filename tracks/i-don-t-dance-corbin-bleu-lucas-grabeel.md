Hey oh, play ball
Hey, hey, oh

Hey, batter, batter
Hey battter, batter swing
I've got to just do my thing

Hey, batter, batter
Hey batter, batter swing, yeah

I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game
It's easy
Step up to the place, start swingin

I wanna play ball now, and that's all
This is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me, yeah

You'll never know
Oh I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time, yeah
Come on

I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no
If I could do this, well, you could do that
But I don't dance
Hit it out of the park

I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score, swingin on the dance floor
I don't dance, no

Hey, batter, batter
Hey batter, batter swing
I've got to just do my thing

Hey, batter, batter
Hey batter, batter swing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Two-steppin, now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance
It's easy
Take your best shot, just hit it

I've got what it takes, playin my game
So you better spin that pitch
You're gonna throw me, yeah
I'll show you how I swing

You'll never know
Oh I know
If you never try
There's just one little thing
That stops me every time, yeah
Come on

I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I could do this, well, you could do that
But I don't dance
Hit it out of the park

I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh no
Slide home, you score, swingin on the dance floor
I don't dance, no

Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance
Swing it out, spin around, do the dance
I wanna play ball, not dance hall
I'm makin a triple, not a curtain call
I can prove it to you til you know it's true
'Cause I can swing it, I can bring it to the diamond too
You're talkin a lot, show me what you got
Stop swing

Hey
Come on, swing it like this
Oh, swing
Jitterbug, just like that

That's what I mean, that's how you swing
You make a good pitch but I don't believe
I say you can
I know I can't
I don't dance

You can do it
I don't dance, no
Nothing to it, atta boy, atta boy, yeah

Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, bater what?
One, two, three, four, everybody swing
Come on

I don't dance
I know you can
Not a chance, no, no
If I could do this, well, you could do that
But I don't dance
Hit it out of the park

I don't dance
I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score, swingin on the dance floor
I don't dance no
