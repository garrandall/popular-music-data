Lover, said you're leavin'
Gotta leave me behind
Got your lovesakes packed in a suitcase
Givin' me your sympathy smile

Just when I'm down on my good luck
You're walking away

Every cloud has a silver lining
It's the darkest before the dawn
I was born to look upon the bright side
Ever since the day I was born
Quietest just before the storm

Dreamer, you call me dreamer?
You're smiling up to stay cool
Love, it burns for the hunger
To be kind, you got to be cruel

Just 'cause I'm down on my good luck
You're walking away

Every cloud has a silver lining
It's the darkest before the dawn
I was born to look upon the bright side
Ever since the day I was born
Quietest just before the storm

Fire, 'cause you're a denier
You never really loved me at all
But that's okay, 'cause baby, one day
Heh, angel change and I will be go

'Cause I'll be riding my good luck
I need reason to stay

Every cloud has a silver lining
It's the darkest before the dawn
I was born to look upon the bright side
Ever since the day I was born
Quietest just before the storm
