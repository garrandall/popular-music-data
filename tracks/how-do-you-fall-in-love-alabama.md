My heart fell to the floor
The night you broke the news
Said you couldn't feel it anymore
Those words that rolled off your tongue
Tore my world in two
As you turned and walked on out the door
I've been trying to get over you
And get on with my life
But the more I do without you
The more I realize

I can't love you any less,
No matter how I try
You left me with a feeling,
That just won't seem to die
And it's killing me knowing,
I'll never hold you like before
I don't love you any less,
You don't love me anymore

Well girl, I hope you never feel
The way I feel tonight
It's a hopeless kind of pain
Well I'm not even comin' close
To gettin' over you
Feels like it's never gonna end
So why do I keep hangin' on
And wastin' my time
Wish I could let you go
But this old heart of mine

Can't love you any less,
No matter how I try
You left me with a feeling,
That just won't seem to die
And it's killing me knowing,
I'll never hold you like before
I don't love you any less,
You don't love me anymore

Girl, I don't love you any less,
You don't love me, anymore...
