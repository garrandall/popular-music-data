Mercedes:
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling you. Hm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye. Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
Darling, I love you
Oh I'll always, I'll always love you
