She said he so sweet 
I wanna lick the wrapper 

And she, she licked me 
Like a lollipop 
Like a lollipop 

Shorty wanna thug 
Bottles in the club 
Shorty wanna hump 
Yah know I like to touch 
Yah lovely lady lumps 
Shorty wanna thug 
Bottles in the club 
Shorty wanna hump 
Yah know I like to touch 
Yah lovely lady lumps

Cute lil' mama had a swag like mine 
She even wear her hair 
Down her back like mine 
I make her feel right 
When its wrong like lyin' 
Man she ain't never 
Had a love like mine 
But Man I ain't never 
Seen an ass like hers 
That -- in my mouth 
Had me loss for words 
Told her to back it up 
Like berp berp 
And I made that ass jump 
Like jerp jerp 
And that's when she 
She licked me 
Like a lollipop 
Like a lollipop 

Shorty wanna thug 
Bottles in the club 
Shorty wanna hump 
Yah know I like to touch 
Yah lovely lady lumps 
Shorty wanna thug 
Bottles in the club 
Shorty wanna hump 
Yah know I like to touch 
Yah lovely lady lumps

Won't you get on your knees 
Won't you get on your knees 

Call me so I can 
Make it juicy for you 
Call me so I can 
Get it juicy for you 
Call me so I can 
Make it juicy for you 
Call me so I can 
Get it juicy 

Call me so I can 
Come and do it for you 
Call me so I can 
Come and prove it for you 
Call me so I can 
Make it juicy for you 
Call me so I can 
Get it juicy 

Shorty wanna thug 
Bottles in the club 
Shorty wanna hump 
Yah know I like to touch 
Yah lovely lady lumps 
Won't you get on your knees
