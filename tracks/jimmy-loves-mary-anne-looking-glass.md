Just seventeen, everything that you've seen 
It's all there in her eyes
So many years of her poor mama's tears 
And her daddy's sweet lies

There's nobody home
Mary-Anne's alone
Almost fully grown
And worrying the whys

Jimmy's been down, he's been out and around
And he knows where it's at
Love to be good if he thought that he could
But it isn't like that

He don't make mistakes
What he makes, he takes
Jimmy gets all the breaks 
'Cause he knows how

Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right

She's not alone and she picks up the phone 
And she hears Jimmy say
Mother I'm beat, I'm so sick of the street
Feel like running away

There's no life here at all
The city seems so small
There's sweeter music calling us away
Let it play

Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right

This big dollar town, it can drag you right down
If you go it alone
Even the strong don't survive very long
When they're out on their own

Jimmy knows it's true 
Mary-Anne knows it too
They can see each other through
If they hold on

Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right

Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right
