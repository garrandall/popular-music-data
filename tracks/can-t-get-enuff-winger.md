(Hey hey) I can't get enuff (hey hey!)
(Hey hey) I can't get enuff (hey hey!)
Ya don't make it easy, ya never keep it straight
But you're so damn sexy, I can't keep away
I need your love, I need your skin, I need you baby, to let me in
I can't get enuff of you baby - I can't get enuff, it's never enough
I can't get enuff, I'm still hungry - baby give it up, 'cause I can't get enuff
It's alright, it feels good, when I'm in your chains, it's understood
That you're my owner, my only will, come and get me while I'm quiet and still
I can't get enuff of you baby - I can't get enuff, it's never enough
I can't get enuff, I'm still hungry - baby give it up, don't you know
I can't get enuff of you baby
Can't get enuff - of you baby
Never enough - do you want to give me some
Can't get enuff - don't keep me waiting
Never enuff - (hey hey) put it right here
I can't get enuff, I'm still hungry
Can't get enuff - of you baby - never enough - do you want to give me some
Can't get enuff - don't keep me waiting - never enuff
It's alright, it feels good, when I'm in your chains, it's understood
My soul confession, devil's due, come and get me girl, it's up to you
I can't get enuff of you baby - I can't get enuff, it's never enough
I can't get enuff, I'm still hungry - baby give it up, don't you know
I can't get enuff of you baby - come and get me
I can't get enuff, I'm still hungry - I can't get enuff
