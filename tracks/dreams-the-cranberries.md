Oh, my life
Is changing everyday
In every possible way

And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you

Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

Ah, la-a-la-ah
La la laaaa
La-a-la-ah
La-ah ah ah

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore

And they'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

And now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find

A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh, my life
Is changing everyday
In every possible way

And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
