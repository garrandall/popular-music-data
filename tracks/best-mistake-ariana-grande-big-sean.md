How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
I know love can be a beach with no shore
Yeah I count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to see I'm the one that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's an older you
I wish you were happy, I guess that's the thing I should be providing
No number twos, both one of ones, and we the oddest
Couple, only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
Start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
