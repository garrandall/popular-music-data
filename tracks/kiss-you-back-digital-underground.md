Shimmy shimmy cocoa-pop
Shimmy shimmy cocoa-pop
Shimmy shimmy cocoa-pop
Shimmy shimmy cocoa-pop
We-we chocolate cross-over
Yea, we chocolate cross-over
See me cocoa might go pop
I'm cocoa and I might go pop

Now it's about time that I cleared this
so pardon me miss
but I'd like for you to hear this
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
You see, I feel real good inside, and it's just from your nearness
there's no need for you to fear this
Kiss me, I'll kiss you back
mmm-

Well ya look kinda cute to me
I think we can achieve this
plus you act like you need this
Kiss me and I'll kiss you back
You act real fly
Money-B's not buyin' it
quit denyin' it
you're better off tryin' it
Freak me girl and I'll freak you back
(duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh)

Through any kinda weather
will me and you forever
stay together
Well I just don't know
but I'll tell ya what though
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
(kiss you back)
And I guess you wanna know if I'm gonna be around
I ain't sure but I'll tell you what I do know
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
(kiss you back)
Awright, lets do this

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Yea, Kiss me and I'll kiss you back
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
You with it? 'cause if you with it, I'm with it, yo
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Yea, mmm-
Just kiss me then I'll kiss you back
I'll kiss you back, I'll kiss you back

Now I'm hopin' that you hear me
'cause I love it when you're near me
and I'm tellin' you sincerely
that if you kiss me girl I'll kiss you back
'cause I really really really like you
and I just want to make it clear

we're gonna keep it fair and square
kiss me and I'll kiss you back

Yo it's not funny!
real cute is what you say to me
but any other way you play me
If you love me then I'll love you back
When you say I get the most out of this it kind of bothers me
a fair exchange and no robbery
Love me girl and I'll love you back

Now I'm hopin that you hear me
cause I love it when you're near me
And I know you know I knew this
so I guess that we can do this
Awright, sing it with me again, c'mon

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Come on, keep it going
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Yeah, ladies?
If you love me boy I'll love you back
Oh yeah? Yo I'm with it!
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Awright, awright that's cool, now let's change it up a little

If you play with my tummy I'll tickle your feet
You know?
If you touch me here I'll touch you there
Yeah, put lotion on me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
I'll kiss you back
If you love me girl I'll love you back
I'll love you back

We know what you go though
sometimes we put you down
People treat you coldly
they know you sleep around
We never want to disrespect you
And tell anyone in town
But if you love me then I'll love you back
I'm askin' if you're down

I'm hopin' that you hear me 'cause I love it when you're near me

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
I'll kiss you back
You know I know you knew this so I guess that we could do this
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean if it's a deal to you it's a deal to me, but yo
Kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Yo let's kick it one more time, come on
kick it

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Kiss me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
And I'll kiss you back
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
If you play with my feet I'll tickle your tummy
If you love me boy I'll love you back
Yea, I like it when the girls do it
If you love me boy I'll love you back
Come one ladies, one more time, kick it
If you love me boy I'll love you back

Cause if you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
But if you hit me then I'll hit you back
Smack me and I'll smack you back
If you scratch me here I'll scratch you there
Aww, put lotion on me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
If you kiss me girl I'll kiss you back
If you touch me here I'll thouch you there
Touch me here, baby, and I'll touch you there
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
