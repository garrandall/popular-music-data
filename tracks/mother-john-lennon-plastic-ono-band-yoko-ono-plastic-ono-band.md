Mother, you had me
But I never had you
I wanted you
But you didn't want me
So
I got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye

Father, you left me
But I never left you
I needed you
But you didn't need me
So
I just got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Children, don't do
What I have done
I couldn't walk
And I tried to run
So
I got to tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Mama don't go
Daddy come home
Mama don't go
Daddy come home
Mama don't go
Daddy come home
Mama don't go
Daddy come home
