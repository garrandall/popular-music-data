Now there's a theory
That everybody has a love somewhere

(Somewhere) Yeah (Somewhere)

But I had begin to believe
That mine wasn't there, oh, oh
Oh but then, you came to me and proved the theory
And all of my days
I wanna have you near me with a
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love
That's all I need now
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

Oh, oh I'd been searching here and there

(Oh yeah)

Seems you came from outta nowhere

(Oh yeah)

With the kind of love I wanted to share
I feel good now, oh, oh, oh yeah

Ah, before you came along
I had some sad and lonely nights

(Sad and lonely so sad and lonely)

I thought it was gonna take a miracle to make things right
Yes I did now
Oh but then you came to me as if by magic
And ended the loneliness that was so tragic with your...
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love now
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

Ohyeah!

Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

I've got to have it

Sweet, sweet love, yeah, yeah

Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

Sweet, sweet love

You know I need it now

Your wonderful sweet, sweet love!

Oh! Everyday I had cried so much
You came to me and you showed me such
Tenderness with your loving touch
I feel good now
Ah baby yeah, yeah
I need, I need, I need, I need

Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

Your sweet loving

Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

It's getting so I can't be without you
Wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I'm talking about your sweet love
Your sweet loving
Talking 'bout your loving
