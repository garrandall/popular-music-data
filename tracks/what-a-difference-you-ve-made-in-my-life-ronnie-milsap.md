What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life

What a change you have made in my heart
What a change you have made in my heart
You replaced all the broken parts
Oh, what a change you have made in my heart

Love to me was just a word in a song that had been way overused
But now I've joined in the singin'
'Cause you've shown me love's true meanin'
That's why I want to spread the news

What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life

What a difference you've made in my life (listen to it)
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made, yeah

What a difference you've made in my life
Difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made

Go ahead and sing it

What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
Yeah-heah-eah-eah-heah
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh yeah, sing it to me
What a difference you've made

What a difference you've made in my life, woh-oh-oh-oh
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made, in my life...
