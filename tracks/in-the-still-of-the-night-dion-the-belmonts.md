In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me as I love you
Are you my life to be
My dreams come true

Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight like
The moon growing dim on
The rim of the hill
In the chill still of the night
Still of the night
