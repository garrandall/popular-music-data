Oh well there never was anything in my life
That I got just for asking
And I never heard of anything
That was won without a fight
Now I'm in another corner
Only the times have changed
A new page is turning over
But the book is just the same

I want to come out fighting
I want to step out fighting
I'm in a head spin waiting for that bell to ring
I want to step out fighting

Some are trying to turn a clock back
They are working ceaslessly
In the dark of their black hearts
Bearing down on me, bearing down on me
C'mon
Now we've turned another corner
So we meet them face to face
And I know that I'll be ready
To take my place when they march into the street

I want to come out fighting
I want to step out fighting
When they march into the street, where they're voting with their feet
I'm going to come out fighting

Trapped in a corner and you can't go back
Trapped in a corner and you can't go back
Trapped in a corner and you can't go back
Trapped in a corner and you can't go back
It's frightening
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna step out fighting
When they march into the street, where they're voting with their feet
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna step out fighting
I'm in a head spin waiting for that bell to ring
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna come out fighting
I'm gonna step out fighting
