I never met a girl like you
Tell me why, do you do the things you do
I loved the day I found you
Wrapped my arms around you

Sherry don't say good-bye
You got to satisfy
This pain in my heart for you
Sherry don't say good-bye
You'll only make me cry
I'm falling in love with you
Sherry I wanna marry you
Sherry don't say good-bye
Kind of like to think that I'm still in love with you
Well if you, Sherry only loved me too
I hope and pray you don't leave me
Sherry I still need you

Sherry don't say good-bye
You got to satisfy
This pain in my heart for you
Sherry don't say good-bye
You'll only make me cry
I'm falling in love with you
Sherry I wanna marry you
Sherry don't say good-bye
(Instrumental break)
One of these days I'm gonna buy you a diamond ring
Slip it on your finger when those church bells start to ring
I loved the day that I found you
Wrapped my arms around you

Sherry don't say good-bye
You got to satisfy
This pain in my heart for you
Sherry don't say good-bye
You'll only make me cry
I'm falling in love with you
Sherry I wanna marry you
Sherry don't say good-bye
