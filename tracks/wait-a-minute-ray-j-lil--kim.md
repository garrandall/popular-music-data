Oh uh oh uh yea
I dont think yall ready for this one
The Queen Bee knockout collabo'
And if ya don't know, now ya know


I been workin all day (and now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (when the line is long)
Girls in the club (you wanna fuck)
Ice grillin these thugs (I wanna thong)
Is it cause I'ma shine (major ice)
I'm talkin about blind ya (like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (without my team)
Cali sticky green (know what I mean)
It's on and poppin
The DJ's rockin
Chickens is watchin
It's on tonight
You had a long day yo
Buy the champ by the caseload
Pockets full of pesos

Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Yo you know the words say it (wait a minute)

I'm talkin about blind ya (like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (without my team)
Cali sticky green (know what I mean)
So much you go through
Only problems know you
Let's party like we supposed to

Wait a minute ain't that Brandy's little brother
Straight from the East side
And that's how I ride

In the land of women
Sunny days chrome spinnin
Juice and ginin

And true you're another one
Representin where you from
Sex you're gettin some

Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Yo you know the words say it (wait a minute)
