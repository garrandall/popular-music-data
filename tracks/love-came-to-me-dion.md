Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do

I, I live in dreams
Strange as it seems
Love came to me

When I, I opened my eyes
I realized
Love came to me
Only this time for real

A-sing it now:

Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Uh-uh-uh, oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (oh-oh-oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do

I tell ya now
Love makes me-ah, makes me feel so good (hunh!)
Just like I, I dreamed it would
And I'm glad that-ah, I found you
'Cause-ah love is a gas and I know it will last

And I -
(Love came to me)
I feel so good
(Love came to me)
And knock knock knock on wood
(Love came to me)
Yeah, I'm in a whirl
(Love came to me)
I just love that girl

Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (woe-oh-oh-oh-oh yeah now)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Uh uh uh uh )
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Oh Oh Oh)

No-ow love makes me, makes me feel so good
Just like I, I dreamed it would
And I'm so glad that-ah, I found you
'Cause - ah-ah - love is a gas and I know it will last

And I -
(Love came to me)
I feel so good
(Love came to me)
And knock knock on wood
(Love came to me)
I-I'm in a whirl
(Love came to me)
I just love that little girl now

Sing it:
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Oh-oh-oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (Oh-oh yeah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do (la-ah-ah-ah)
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
