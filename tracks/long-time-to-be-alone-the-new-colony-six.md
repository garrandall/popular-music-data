When I saw you yesterday
It started all again
The hurt that I had left behind
Is caught up once again

Everyone's in love
But love can bring you down
But no one wants the love
You have to give

Love means more than life to me
I'd love to have you back
Stopped and laughed at things we did
The laughter makes me sad

It's a long long time
To be alone (long long time)
To be alone

Do you remember asking me
Won't you stay a while
When I said forever
That made you smile

I look for that smile
On every face I see
But smiles don't mean a thing
If they're not for me

Love means more than life to me
I'd love to have you back
Stopped and laughed at things we did
The laughter makes me sad

It's a long long time
To be alone (long long time)
To be alone

Love means more than life to me
I'd love to have you back
Stopped and laughed at things we did
The laughter makes me sad

It's a long long time
To be alone (long long time)
To be alone (long long time)
To be alone (long long time)
To be alone (long long time)
Hmmmm (long long time)
