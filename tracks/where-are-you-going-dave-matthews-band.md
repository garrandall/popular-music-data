Where are you going, with your long face pulling down?
Donât hide away, like an ocean
But you canât see, but you can smell
And the sound of waves crash down

I am no Superman
I have no reasons for you
I am no hero, oh thatâs for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go is where I wanna be

Where are you going, where do you go?
Are you looking for answers to questions under the stars?
Well, if along the way you are growing weary,
You can rest with me until a brighter day
And you're okay

I am no Superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh thatâs for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go is where I wanna be

Where are you going, where do you go?

Where do you go?
Where are you going, where do you go?

I am no Superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh thatâs for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go is where I wanna be

Where are you going, where do you go?
Tell me, where are you going, where?

Letâs go.
