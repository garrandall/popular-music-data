(Midnight, midnight)
(Midnight, midnight)
(Midnight, midnight)
(Midnight, midnight)
(Midnight)

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Do you see some possibilities
Try and get away tonight
You can leave with me
It's a golden opportunity

And when the sun goes down
My fantasies run wild
When midnight comes around
I really come alive
At midnight!
Oh, I really come alive
(Midnight, midnight)
Oh, my fantasies run wild
(Midnight, midnight)
I got so much energy
(Midnight, midnight)
Yeah, deep inside of me, girl

Come a little closer girl
Look into my mind
You would be surprised at what you find
There's a roaring lion inside of me
Waiting for the night
Comes out only when the time is right

And when the sun goes down
My fantasies run wild
When midnight goes around
I really come alive
At midnight
(Midnight, midnight)
Oh, I really come alive
(Midnight, midnight)
All my fantasies run wild
(Midnight, midnight)
I have so much energy
(Midnight, midnight)
Yeah, yeah, deep inside of me, girl
