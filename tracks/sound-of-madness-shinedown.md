Yeah, I get it
You're an outcast
Always under attack
Always coming in last
Bringing up the past
No one owes you anything

I think
You need a shotgun blast
A kick in the ass
So paranoid
Watch your back

Oh my, here we go

Another loose cannon gone bi-polar
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I'm still laughing like hell

You think that by crying to me
Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here to explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
When you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself?

I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
If there's an afterlife
Then it'll set you free
But I'm not gonna part the seas
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy

You think that by crying to me
Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here to explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
When you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
When you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and fight

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
When you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

When you gonna wake up and fight for yourself?
When you gonna wake up and fight for yourself?
When you gonna wake up and fight for yourself?
