I used to walk home all alone
It used to be so sad
I used to be all by myself
It used to be so bad

Until you
You came along
And took me by the hand
Until you
You came along
And said that you would be my man


Now I'm jumping up and down
Spinning all around
Because of you, babe

I'm as happy as can be
And it's definitely
Because of you babe
Just because of you


I used to go to bed at night
Wishing I had a friend
Someone to hold and squeeze me tight
A very special friend

Until you
You came along
And told me you would be the one
Until you
You came along
And held me in your arms




You are a dream come true
And there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do
Baby, just for you





Baby, I love you
I love you
