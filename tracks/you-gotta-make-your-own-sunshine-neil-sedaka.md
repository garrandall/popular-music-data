Whenever the day is bringing you down
And nothing's going your way
Just turn it around
Don't let the world upset you
Get depressed and what doesn't get you
You've got a chance to make it
Reach right out and take it
Leave your worries behind
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine

If nothing in life is turning you on
And everyone of your friends
All seem to be gone
Just start yourself a hummin'
Remember that the good times are coming
Life is a celebration
Don't waste your invitation
Hang those tears on the line
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine

When you're feeling down
You gotta aim high
Don't stare at the ground
Reach for the sky... reach for the sky!

Just keep yourself up
Don't ever complain
Before you walk in the sun
You gotta laugh in the rain

Just get your act together
Be readdy for who and whatever
Life is a smile so find it
Put your face behind it
Get it straigh in your mind
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine

Just get your act together
Be readdy for who and whatever
Life is a smile so find it
Put your face behind it
Get it straigh in your mind
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine
