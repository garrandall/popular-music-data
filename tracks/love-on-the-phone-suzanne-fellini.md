Miles and miles away from you
You know I'd fly there if you told me to
We speak on the phone but where is your body
Help me Help me

It's so hard when I'm feeling on fire
And all I can hold is the telephone wire
It's so hard being almost alone
And lying here in the dark

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone

I call your number and it's rings once or twice
You answer softly and your voice sounds so nice
You whisper sweet things and you tell me what to do
And I respond and make love to you

I know you want me I know you care
I'm over here You're over there
You know I want you cause you're the best
Hang on a minute I'll get undressed
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No!

It's so hard when I'm feeling on fire
And all I can hold is the telephone wire
It's so hard being almost alone
And lying here in the dark

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone

Long distance loving it's not ideal
But just the same we like how it feels
I am a woman and you are my man
I guess we're doing the best we can

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Love on the phone
Love on the phone
