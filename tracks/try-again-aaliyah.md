It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky-freaky
Baby girl

What would you do
To get to me
What would you say
To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again
If I hesitated
To let you in

Now would you be yourself
Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you stay

And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

I'm into you,
You into me
But I can't let it go
So easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Could be eternity
Or just a week

Ayo, our chemistry
Is off the chain
It's perfect now
But will it change?
This ain't a "Yes"
This ain't a "No"
Just do your thing
We'll see how it goes

And if at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

If you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date
What about the next date

I said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be buggin' on the first date
What about the next date

And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

And if at first you don't succeed
You dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

And if at first you don't succeed
Then you dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed baby
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky

And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again

It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky

One more beat
A new millennium baby
Let me out
You guess what it is
