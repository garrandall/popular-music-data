You need a man to treat you like the woman you are
Those little boys are just fooling around with your heart

What you gonna do now that you're all alone
You need a rock not a rolling stone

So when a boy just ain't enough
You need a man made of stronger stuff get ready

Rock steady all night long
Rocksteady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true
Rock steady just me and you

You need somebody that will help you with your heavy load
Well I've been there baby lord give me a rock and roll

I can bend but I won't break
Cuz you aint got what I can't take

So when you're tired of your little girls
You want a woman that will rock your world get ready
Whoa

Rock steady all night long
Rocksteady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true
Rocksteady just me and you
Rock steady baby

Amateurs and debutantes
They can't give you what you really want
When All the others have been untrue
I'll give you something to hold onto

Rock steady all night long
Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true
Rock steady baby me and you

Ya baby
Whoa rock it baby
You know what I'm talking about
Come on and rock it baby
I want you to rock it baby
Come on in rock it baby
Now let it rock it baby
Rock steady all night long
