Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
(Ay, my people, this is mega unstoppable)
Don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, the party


This is that original, this has no identical
You can't hack my digital, future aboriginal
Get up off my genitals, I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals, call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical, subscribe you some chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me; invisible
I'm old school like biblical, futuristic next le-vel
Never on that typical
Will I stop? Oh never, no


I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now, baby)


Don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
You can not stop us now


I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now baby)


Don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it (stop it, stop it)
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't stop us now
Don't stop the party!
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't stop stop stop
The the the don't stop the party
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't stop stop stop
The the don't stop the party


You could call me crazy man, everyday I'm partyin'
You could find me at the club, poppin' bottles minglin'
Ladies dancin' to the jam, actin' naughty, man oh man
Got me in the mood again, afterparty partyin'
Yeah, I keep it happenin', takin' shots whatever, man
Party like a veteran, music is my medicine
You won't find me settlin', can't be stopped; I'm steppin' in
Keep it goin' 'til the end, yeah, that's right, here we go again


I'm that one that lights it up, we red hot like firetrucks
Burn that book cause that's whassup, tell that DJ turn it up
We droppin, that music, for people all around
Keep rockin, head knockin, cause they can't shut us down


And ain't no stoppin, we gon' keep on rockin
Baby ain't no stoppin, you can not stop us now


I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now baby)


Don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
You can not stop us now


I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now baby)


Don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't stop us now




Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, the party
