Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

Woo!

I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at"
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"

Well I've gotta be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
