Saturday night I was down town
Working for the F.B.I.
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Boot legging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the D.A. man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of forty fives made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise

She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a five nine beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Well, a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy"
I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Well, suddenly we heard a siren
And everybody started to run
A jumping out of doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shooting a gun

The D.A. was pumping my left hand
And she was holding my right
I told her don't get scared
Cause you're gonna be spared
I gotta be forgiven
If I want to spend my living with

A long cool woman in a black dress
Just a five nine beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all

Had it all
Had it all
