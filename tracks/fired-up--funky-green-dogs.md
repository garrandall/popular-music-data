You know I was driving in the car with daddy x today
Hittin' my bong, he's like
"That's just an everyday thing for you, huh? That's your reality?"
I was like "yeah"

(Light 'em up
Light 'em up y'all
Light 'em up
Light it up y'all)

I just smoke whenever, you know what I mean?
I'll fire a bowl up on the road
I'll fire a bowl up in the house
In the bathroom, or garage
The park

(You bring the owl
I'll bring the papers
 we'll roll fat bones and
Spark up the vapors)

My parent's house
Restaurants, clubs
Venues
Police presence
Many and many tour buses

(I'll take the high road
You take the low
A thousand pounds and pounds of that
Sticky endo
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all)

State to state, man I even sparked in other countries
Bullet trains
Goin' from Amsterdam over to Belgium, me and Bobby B firing up fatties in the rear of the train
They were trippin' on that shit
Look at the crazy high Americans
We was just lovin' it though
Ripped!

(Shop and get two quarters and we
Recommend two ounces
We harvest strains with different names
So cali can pronounce it
I'll take the high road
You take the low
This jam goes round and out
To all the people that grow
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all)

Goin' through all different coffee shops, checkin' all the strains out
Walking out, lookin' at menus and shit
 don't even matter, got all different shit.
White widow, , super silver haze, fuckin' blueberry you know.
Some people.., there's a different widow in every show you know what I mean?
You just gotta check it out
Blue dolphin, cap-two,
Took the tube  nice little hash pad in the morning

But the morning shops are open early
And go from there, start headin' uptown
Hit a couple shops, jump on a train maybe

(Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, keep those joints burnin'
Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, it's the grow room jam
Jam
It's the grow room jam
Jam)

No worryin'
The way it should be
 prepared for weed
Some people, they just ask like, they just think you're going like 
I want some, I need some herb, but you know, I ain't gonna
I ain't gonna buy it if it's not the dank nuggets
The dank I want a zip for sure
But if it's like, just, regulars you know, give me a quarter to get me through the day
And you'd be surprised how many times I get the quarter you know what I mean?
I just wish

(Where I want, yeah
None defy it
You and I together in a
Stance to fight it
Just one voice
Legalize it
It's just a plant
Legalize
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all)

 8 g's in a day
Yeah, you know what I'm talking bout
The alien, the hindu
Goin' out to fuckin' afghan

Losin' weight like a motherfucker just can't do nothin' about it

(Sure as the sun shines
Show them a blaypo
Sure as the blue wine stars
Ass don't wanna blow
Drop the seeds in soil and it
Reaches the shack
Smoking more than water in a
Loving calf
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all
It's the grow room jam
Jam y'all)

What are you gonna do, not get the weed? It's the bomb
We sure as hell don't wanna smoke that BC they're rollin' back home
BC they've got pounds and pounds of the BC but no one seems to have the crip
Or whoever got the crip don't wanna part with it
Can't blame 'em though, you know what I mean
When I got the crip I don't wanna part with it neither, hell no!
If I got the crip I'm smokin' you can come get a session on
We'll get ripped
Fuckin'
Smoke a half, half an ounce real quick in a session, just roll it up
Put it in that keefebox
Line a few joints with that keefe, whoooo!
Blast off dog in a sandbox down as my girl calls it

(Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, keep those joints burnin'
Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, it's the grow room jam
Jam
The grow room jam
Jam)

And then all of a sudden it hits you and you can't breathe and you blow it all out
And you explode and you go into a mad coughing fit
And it's like you're swimming up, you're sitting down on the bottom of a pool tryin' to swim up for air and you're like gasping.
You can't get it cause you can't breathe the air and it's crazy
And you're like swimming and swimming and when you get up like get up for that final gasp
And you get it... oooof... and your lungs expand with that air you know.
And your eyes drop. And you just start laughin' like the first time you ever took a rip.
You don't wanna sit up, you don't wanna do shit

So listen to the grow room jam

Cause we're getting ripped!

Watch the pipes go, pipes go, pipes go

(Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, keep those joints burnin'
Keep the lights on, keep the cycles turnin'
Keep the lights on, it's the grow room jam
Jam y'all
It's the grow room jam
Jam)

And you get theâ¦ the green crack and the kevork and theâ¦ the troph.
The millhouse and all types ofâ¦ all types of organics from the rast man.

(Shop and get two quarters and we
Recommend two ounces
We harvest strains with different names
So cali can pronounce it)

We used to get the d dog personally to b money.
Up in the bay that's all up in the bay all those strains.
We go down to Diego and pick up some of the BR better known as the bull rider!

Hey yo Patrick hold up, hold up, dog
Hey yo ease
Hey! Hey yeah,
We just, you know, just keepin' it funky for yall.
Little, hand clap, with the clap.
Yo we sit in a cloud, sittin' in my green room, releasin' my herbs
My green room how we toke
And if you don't know you're never gonna know
That's how we doin' it
Kottonmouth Kings outsmokin' the planet
D Loc, X, Johnny Richter, Dj B, Big P, Dog Boy, Lou Dog, the munchies

Well don't forget little man!

I can't forget about Kevin Zing, layin' down the foundation
Yeah yeah, you better plant your seeds and keep your plants lookin' sharp
Hold up, hold up, I gotta fart



Nice

Aw yeah yeah yeah, oh excuse me
Oops sorry about that
You know I'm gonna cover up that smell from my fuckin', from my asshole

Man let's blaze some of that orange chronic up in this place man!

Alright, you'd better fuckin' keep your shit on point
Because after this season our crops are lookin' too clean
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm a little hype right now I'm going to keep this shit rollin'
Let me turn this motherfuckin cake
Stayin' blasted with my funk
Mixin' the flavors, changin' it up
So grab your lighters, ola ola ay!
Yo it's time to get hammer done
Out of commission until I throw up
So if you want to get...



Oh, oh, hold up
Chick woods on the line, hold up
CZ
No I'm done
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Alright
Hey

You know what I'm saying? You wanna get puked on?
Kottonmouth Kings is going on forever ever
You know I mean, until we die, just remember our spirit lives on in the underground
3 kids from P town
You won't see us on the radio
Motherfuckers make the world go round
Or MTV
Blast you out, little funk, little whatever, you know what I'm saying?
Just you're done, go to bed, you're a donkey

Bye

Get some sleep

Bye

Bye bye!

You ain't gonna stop these kids, yo
So whatever you wanna do, just
Plan out your fuckin' shit and keep a grip on your dick

Done

It's the grow room jam!


Hey you got the phone?
Hurry up!

Uh-uh, grab that shit man

I just got done laying that shit!

Hello?

See, they fuckin' hung up anyways

(Let's go smoke)
Done
