Teen angel, teen angel
Teen angel, ooh, ooh

That fateful night
The car was stalled
Upon the railroad track
We pulled him out and we were safe
But he went running back

(CHORUS)
Teen angel, can you hear us
Teen angel, can you see us
Are you somewhere up above
He's on his way, your own true love

What was it he was looking for
That took his life that night
They said they'd found your picture
Clutched in his fingers tight

(CHORUS)

Just sweet sixteen
And now he's gone
They've taken him away
And now you'll kiss his lips again
We buried him today

(CHORUS)

Teen angel, teen angel
Answer us, please
