Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older


I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight


I ain't got many friends left to talk to
No one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night, we'll keep it undercover


I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight


Try to stop my hands from shakin'
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'


As you leave me, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you:
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon


I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight, yeah
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight


(Use your love, lose your love) Your love
(Use your love) Well I don't wanna lose
(Lose your tonight) I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose (Use your tonight) Your love
(Lose your tonight) Your love, your love
(Use your tonight) Your love
(I don't lose your love tonight) Ahhh
(Use your tonight) Your love
