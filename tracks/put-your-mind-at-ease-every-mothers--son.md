Walking with care as I climb
Every step of the stairway
Knowing that she's thinking
Only of me while her parents
Are holding a farewell

Why must I feel like
I've tried to steal
What she's giving

Now is the time that
We both take a stance
And it's time that we
Learned about living

Put your mind at ease
Go put your mind at ease
Under the tree
Out where it's breezy

Nobody here but me and you
We'll do the things
We meant to do
Sit back, relax
We'll take it easy

Things that are good can be
Misunderstood and mistaken
Dying to know the direction to go
And it's time that
Some action be taken

We cannot fight
Cause we're doing it right
But you're losing

Going for the ride
Gotta let you decide
On the accent
You plan to be using

Put your mind at ease
Go put your mind at ease
Under the tree
Out where it's breezy

Nobody here but me and you
We'll do the things
We meant to do
Sit back, relax
We'll take it easy

Sit back, relax
And take it easy
Put your mind at ease
Put your mind at ease...
