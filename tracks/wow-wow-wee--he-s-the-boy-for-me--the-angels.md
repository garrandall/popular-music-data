It was love at first sight
When I saw him on
The corner that night
He was standing
With a bunch of guys
There's something 'bout
The boy that caught my eye
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, the handsomest boy
That I ever did see
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, I had to get
Him to notice me
I walked by the corner
Nice and slow
He looked me over
From head to toe
It worked like a charm
I was getting my wish
Cause he was swallowing the
Bait like a hungry fish
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, the boy looked good
And he looked at me
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, he sure is
The boy for me
I smiled at him
Then he turned away
I kept walking
Till I heard him say
Hey little girl
Where you going
Said it's nobody's business
But mine alone, yeah
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, that boy
Started following me
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, my plan's
Working perfectly
Now we're together
All the time
He'll never know
How I made him mine
I let him keep thinking
That he picked up me
But I'll know different
Wow wow wee
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, that's the way
It was meant to be
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, I like to keep
The boy following me
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, that's the way
It was meant to be
Wow wow wee and wow wow wee
Oh, yeah, I like to keep
The boy following me
