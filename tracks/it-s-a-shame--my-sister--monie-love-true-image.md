My sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is
I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
So, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister


It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)


Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition


It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)


That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
Cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame


It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat til fade)
