How many way can I tell that u love you
And I need you in my life
You got me rushing home thru traffic at night
Just to hod you tight
So
Listen babe
I can never forget your love
Yes me and u
My wish came true
And your everything that I dreamed of
I wanna kiss you
Hold u close when I miss you
Wanan wrap u in these arms
I'm so glad that I'm the one
That keeps your body warm at night
I'll cook for u
When I wake up because I love you
I live for you and I would die without you in my world

U melt my heart away
No one can compare to u
I wanna grow old with u babe
U melt my heart away
I appreciate the things u do
My baby is beautiful

When she wakes up in the morning
Shes ready to make love cause shes loves me
She don't need no makeup
In the morning
Cause my baby's perfect
Everything I do's worth it
Even when she wakes up in the morning
Shes ready to make love cause shes loves me
She don't need no makeup
In the morning
Cause my baby's perfect
Everything I do's worth it

Everytime that I see your face
It makes me love u more
I can be everything u need in life and more
So trust in me babe
I'm hear to stay
My love for u could'nteven let me walk away
Everytime that we make love it takes me breathe away
Like
I'll cook for u when I wake up because I love you girl I live for u and I would die without u in my world.

U melt my heart away
No one can compare to u
I wanna grow old with u babe
U melt my heart away
I appreciate the things u do
My baby is beautiful

When she wakes up in the morning
Shes ready to make love cause shes loves me
She don't need no makeup
In the morning
Cause my baby's perfect
Everything I do's worth it
Even when she wakes up in the morning
Shes ready to make love cause shes loves me
She don't need no makeup
In the morning
Cause my baby's perfect
Everything I do's worth it

Now I can relate
Cause I know how it feels
To have someone to truly care for you
I love you
I'm a be hear
Don't want u to escape
Cause I know true love is hard to find
So I keep her heart in mine
Always genuine my lover and friend
And I'll never let her go
As long as I live
She will always be my lady
