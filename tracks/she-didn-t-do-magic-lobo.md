Thumbing across Georgia I ran into Gloria
She seemed like a mystic to me
With a wave of the hand
She could make you feel grand
That was her mystery
Now I'll admit she knew a lot of tricks
But so do lots of other chicks

She didn't do it like you can do magic
She didn't do it to me
She didn't do it like you can do it
She didn't do magic to me

Hiking through Virginia I met Melinda
She looked enchanting to see
She said "Give me your arm
And I'll show you my charms"
That was her sorcery
I say it I will she had a lot of skill
But compared to you she was way down hill

She didn't do it like you can do magic

She didn't do it to me
She didn't do it like you can do it
She didn't do magic to me

Arriving in Cleveland I'm coming to see you
Get your crystal ball out of the drawer
'Cause I can tell if you been using you spell
And baby I know what for
The magic you loaned was to bring me home
And baby my love for you has grown

So you better do it like you can do magic
You better do it to me
'Cause she didn't do it like you can do it
She didn't do magic to me

No she didn't do it like you can do it
She didn't do magic to me
'Cause she didn't do it like you can do it
