Left you at eight
Came back at nine
We still got love
It sure is fine

I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

An hour can be
Such a long, long time
When your lips ain't
Stuck on mine

I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I wanna love you some more

I'm all on fire
My love ain't died
Got a big desire
And I ain't lyin'

I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

I said-a I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
