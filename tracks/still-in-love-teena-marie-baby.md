Yeah, yeah, okay
I know you all hearing that beautiful voice, right?
One more time mama, one more time mama
You see I rub cash money just to see a seal original classes
Y'all might know it's Tina Marie
Who call her lady Tina La Donna, come on mama

Tell me baby, how long has it been
Here you come, and here I go again
I must admit you looking rather fly
You're a sight for sore eyes

Situation wasn't quite that cool
Seven years ago we both the fools
But I'm real enough to let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

I'm lovin' you
I'm still loving you, baby
I'm still in love
Nobody's gonna take your place in my life
No one else but you baby

I'm lovin' you
I'm still lovin' you, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm feeling you, what you feeling tonight? Baby

What's that look upon your face my dear?
It must be magic in the atmosphere
I'm gonna heat it up, the chemistry
Stir it up sugar free
(Stir it up, stir it up baby)

Sexy Joe be blazing everywhere
My crib's closer honey let's go there
You got a sista feening baby please
I'm about to be your main squeeze

I'm lovin' you
I'm still lovin' you, baby
I'm still in love
Nobody's gonna take your place in my life
I'm still in love

I'm lovin' you
I'm still lovin' you, honey
(Still in love with you baby)
I'm feeling you
What you feeling tonight?
(What you feeling)

Come on baby let me stir it up
I'll remix it in my lovin' cup
Things are getting heated, let's go chill
I'm about to be in your grill

Sexy Joe be blazing knuckle sounds
My crib's closer on the west side now
You gotta sista feening baby please
I'm about to be your main squeeze

I'm lovin' you
I'm still loving you, baby
I'm still in love
Nobody's gonna take your place in my life
(Still in love with you babe)
I'm still in love

I'm lovin' you
I'm still lovin' you, honey
(I'm still in love)
I'm feeling you
What you feeling tonight?
(What you feeling?)

(Gonna stir it, gonna stir it, gonna stir it on up)
I'm gonna stir it on up
(Gonna mix it, gonna mix it in my lovin' cup)
I'm gonna mix it in my lovin' cup
(Gonna stir it, gonna stir it, gonna stir it on up)
Stir it on up, stir it on up
(Gonna mix it, gonna mix it in my lovin' cup)
In my lovin' cup

All the ladies to my left if you feel what I'm feeling
Holla, let me hear you scream
(Yeah, yeah)
All the sistas to my right if you been there before
Stir it up with me
(Stir it up, stir it up with me)
All the ladies to my left if you feel what I'm feeling
Holla, let me hear you scream
(Yeah, yeah)
All the sistas to my right if you been there before
Stir it up with me

(Gonna stir it up)
I'm gonna stir it
(Mix it in my cup)
I'm gonna mix it
(Gonna stir it up)
Stir it, stir it
(Mix it in my lovin' cup)

(Gonna stir it up)
I'm gonna stir it
(Mix it in my cup)
Yeah, I'm gonna mix it
(Gonna stir it up)
I'm gonna stir it
(Mix it in my lovin' cup)
Mix it in my cup
Stir it
