I've had it with the same old routine
I've had it with the same old faces, places, every night in my life
I started feeling washed up, washed out, hung up, wrung out, left to dry
Every night
But

I know, yeah I know you're out there, somewhere
Oh I, I can almost hear you callin'
I'm looking for a stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight

I'm tired of the same old "Hello baby, how you're doin', call me often
Where have you been all my life", every night
But I know that someday, somewhere, I'll turn around and you'll be there
Oh in my life, every night
And

I know, yeah I know you're out there, somewhere
Oh I, I can almost hear you callin'
I'm looking for a stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight

And
I know, yeah I know you're out there, somewhere
Oh I, I can almost hear you callin'
I'm looking for a stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight
I'm looking for a stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight
