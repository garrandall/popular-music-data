There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing


I see your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
And I read your letters, you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear


There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing


No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
Let's stay together
Together, baby
Together, yeah
Together, oh, together


I've got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing takes the place of your being there


There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
Oh, oh oh, there ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
The real, the real, there ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
The real, the real, the real, the real thing
Oh, the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
(Not like the real thing)
