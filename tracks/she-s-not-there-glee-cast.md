One, two, three, uh

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho'
Uh

But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door
Eh

Don't try to fight the feelin'
Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Uh

Thank god for mom and dad
For sticking two together
Cause we don't know how
Uh


Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya


You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it til there's nothing at all (Ooh)

We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Oww)

If what they say is ("Nothing is forever")
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes (What makes)
What makes (What makes love the exception?)

So why, oh, why, oh
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance!


Hey ya

Hey ya (Oh-oh, don't want to meet your daddy)
Hey ya (Oh-oh, just want you in my caddy, oh-oh)
Hey ya (Oh-oh, don't want to meet yo' mama)
Hey ya (Oh-oh, just want to make you holla, oh-oh)
Hey ya (I'm, oh-oh, I'm)

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright


Okay now ladies

Now we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I wanna see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go know


Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it (Oh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Oh-oh)
Shake it like a polaroid picture, hey ya

Shake it, sh-shake it (Okay)
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay) ( Shake it, sugar)
Shake it like a polaroid picture (Now all BeyoncÃ©s)

Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (And Lucy Lius)
Shake it, sh-shake it (And baby dolls)
Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Get on the floor, get on the floor)
Shake it like a polaroid picture (You know what to do)

Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (You know what to do)
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (You)
Shake it like a polaroid picture (You know what to do)
