When my world is turning
When it's turning upside down
When all I see is rain
When I think the night won't end
I just think of you
And I can see the sun again

* Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere
When the dreams I dream
All seem a million miles away
When I'm sure I'll never win
When it's looking like I've left my faith
I just look at you baby
And I got reason to believe again

Without you to love me
I'd just be wasting time
And goin' out of my mind
