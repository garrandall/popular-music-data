I wake up feeling
In my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete
Harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive

I gotta get it right, mhm
Get it right, mhm

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
Home, home
Coming home

My mind's heavy and I can't sleep
Not even a memory is good enough
To get me through the night
I'm longin' for the real thing
People who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life

Mhm, I gotta get it right, ohyeah
Get it right, ohyeah

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
Home, home
Coming home
Home, home
Coming home

Yeah I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same (Just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same (It's not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home

I'm feeling lost in all the madness
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home
The sidewalks filled with different faces
So many place but there's none like mine
Coming home
