When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
But if your world should fall apart

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
But if your world should fall apart

I was always thinking... I was always thinking...
I was always thinking... I was always thinking...
I was always thinking... I was always thinking...
I was always thinking...

I was always thinking of games that I was playing
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
I was always thinking... I was always thinking...
I was always thinking... I was always thinking... I...
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
