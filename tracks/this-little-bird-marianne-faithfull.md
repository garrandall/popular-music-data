There's a little bird that somebody sends
Down to the earth to live on the wind
Born on the wind and he sleeps on the wind
This little bird that somebody sends

He's light and fragile and feathered sky blue
So thin and graceful the sun shines through
This little bird who lives on the wind
This little bird that somebody sends

He flies so high up in the sky
Out of reach of human eye
And the only time that he touches the ground
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird dies
