Hey
Well you work and you slave and you spend all day in your thankless job
Then you jump in your Ford
Door to Door
With a hombound mob
Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair
And the one you love is waitin' there

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

When they won't go to bed
And do what you said
And they eat their food
They Cry, and they Fuss and you can't Cuss
Cause they'll say it to
Your Tired, Num, Stressed and your Mad
She smiles and says I Love You Dad

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

Hey, That's what it's all about
Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without
It's a moment frozen there in time
When the reasons all begin to rhyme
Where loves a little bigger and you finally start figurin' out
That's what it's all about

Hey That's what it's all about
The life I couldn't live without
Hey That's What it's all about

That's What it's all about
That's What it's all about
That's What it's all about
