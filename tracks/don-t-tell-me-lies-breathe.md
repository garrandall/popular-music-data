Every move you made before was never meant for real
Over my naivety is this how I should feel?
Burning with my own desire, visions that all seem so clear
Now I see this in your eyes, they'll never ever be another one
Don't tell me lies
Don't tell me lies
Looking back I realize it's always been this way
We must note what has gone and never turn away
When desire takes hold of me, what I've seen just sets me free
Now I see this in your eyes, they'll never ever be another one
Don't tell me lies
Don't tell me lies
Don't tell me lies
Broken loose from indecision
Now I'm alright on my own
Still I wait from your confession
I guess I'm alright on my own
Don't tell me lies
Don't tell me lies
Don't, don't, don't tell me, Don't, don't, don't tell me
Don't tell me lies
