A yellow two piece, black Ray Bans
Your bare feet covered in sand
White jet trails across the blue sky
Your ponytail showing off the sunshine
Like a postcard, out of nowhere
You get to me, you give me that smile and

I'm somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

It doesn't take much for you to move me
Just the way you're leaning into me
It's a holiday when we're together
I wanna stay with you forever

Somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

You're like the fast lane West bound
You feel like a windows rolled down
I can't wait until we get there, somewhere

Somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75
Sunny and 75
