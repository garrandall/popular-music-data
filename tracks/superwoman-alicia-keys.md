Everywhere I'm turning
Nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow so much
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me
Why is that?

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a superwoman

(This is for) for all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
They're coming
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying so hard
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can
(Why is that?)

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Sing it out loud
Yes she is
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a superwoman

When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
'Cause I start to get weak
'Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly

'Cause I am a superwoman
Yes I am
That's right
Yes she is
Come on
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a superwoman
Say it
Yes she is

Oh let me tell you
I am a superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Tell them
'Cause even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a superwoman
That's right

Yes I am
And I'm a superwoman
That's right
Yes she is

Come on
Tell them girl
I'm super (so super)
I'm super (so super)
Yes I am
That's right
(yes we are)
Yes I am,
That's right
Yes you are
