They're here, they are
They are, they are
They're here, they really are

I saw them, I did
I did, I did
I saw them, I really did

They come at night
They sneak at night
They take the power
From our lights

They fly around without a sound
And scare those little towns

They watch us eat and walk
They analyze the way we talk

They're watching us
They are, they are
They're watching, yes, they are

From Maine to California
Up in Michigan too
They're seen all around the world
By millions, it's true

Those little weirdo things
In thier flying machines
I'm telling you
They're watching you

They're here, they are
They are, they are
They're here, they really are

I saw them, I did
I did, I did
I saw them, I really did
Little people

Don't ever try to look in their eyes
I guarantee, they'll hypnotize
They'll make you feel it's just a dream
And take you in their machine

From Maine to California
Up in Michigan too
They're seen all around the world
By millions, it's true

Those little weirdo things
In thier flying machines
I'm telling you
They're watching you

They're here, they are
They are, they are
They're here, they really are

I saw them, I did
I did, I did
I saw them, I really did
Little people
