She knows every move that a man could make
She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give, and she knows how to take
But so many times she's been taken a fool


By those alibis and lying eyes, and all the best lines, Lord knows she heard em all
She's been cheated on, and pushed around, and left alone, Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made, she knows how to make one on you

She once thought that love wasn't just a game
Her feelings once came from the heart
One day I gave her a wedding ring, and one night I tore all those feelings apart

With my alibis and lying eyes, and all the best lines, Lord knows she heard em all
She's been cheated on, and pushed around, and left alone, Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made, she knows how to make...

Her own alibis and lying eyes, and all the best lines, Lord knows she heard em all
She's been cheated on, and pushed around, and left alone, Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made, she knows how to make one on you
