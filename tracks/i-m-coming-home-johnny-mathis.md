Sittin' in a railway station with my suitcase in my hand
Goin' back where I came from, I've had more than I can stand
Of watchin' men destroy my dreams, they picked my brain till it was clean
When I was up they knocked me down
I ain't goin' to hang around, I'm goin' home

I'm goin' home, goin' home
Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game
But usin' people just ain't my thing
And I don't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm goin' home

I'm goin' home, goin' home
Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home

Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home

I'm goin' home, goin' home
Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home

I'm goin' home, goin' home
Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home

I'm goin' home, goin' home
Tell someone to meet me I'm comin' home
