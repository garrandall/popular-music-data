So you're scared to show your feelings
Baby I do understand
Well I don't make a promise I can't keep
And I vow to be a real good friend

In those big green eyes I see a glow of love
I just hope I'm the one you're dreaming of

Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby Oh baby
Let me be the one

We spend all our time together
We can't stand to sleep alone
When you say you have to leave for now
I miss you before you're gone

All along we thought this was absurd (absurd)
Every moment we spend goes by too fast
Darling Darling take this chance with me
Cause I have eyes only for you
Oh baby

Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby Oh baby
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby Oh baby
Let me be the one
For you

Don't be scared to show your feelings
Cause baby I do understand
And I don't make promises that I can't keep
And I vow to be a real good man
