Follow your lone beaten path
Wander where you can't be grabbed
Be aware of hidden dangers
And don't go talkin' to strangers
Babe...
Travel on the midnight road
Ramble where the wind don't blow
Be aware of hidden dangers
And don't you go unto to strangers
Babe...
In these raging days and nights
Look upon whats black and white
And don't you go talkin' to strangers
Take leave of whats behind you
Go where no-one will find you
Be aware of hidden dangers
And don't go you go runnin' to strangers
Babe...
Babe...
Babe...
