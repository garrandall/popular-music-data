Cast Your Fate To the Wind
Steve Alaimo
Words by Carel Werber, Music by Vince Guaraldi
AS AN INTRUMENTAL by the Vince Guaraldi Trio, it peaked at # 22 in 1963
Competing version by Martin Denny didnâ€™t make the Top 100
Vocal versions released later by Steve Alaimo (# 89 in 1965) and by Shelby Flint
(# 61 in 1965)
A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
You set your sail when the tide comes in
And you cast your fate to the wind
You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind
That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone
There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away
So now you're old, you're wise, you're smart
You're just a man with half a heart
You wonder how it might have been
Had you not cast your fate to the wind
