Because they're young, because they're young
The stars are twice as bright above
Their dreams are new but they'll come true
Because they're young and in love
Just like me and you
See the happy couples strolling through the park
Swinging hands as they go by
We know they feel the way we feel
And we also know the reason why
Because they're young, because they're young
The stars are twice as bright above
Their dreams are new but they'll come true
Because they're young and in love
Just like me and you
See the way they search to find a secret spot
Now at last they're all alone
They touch, they kiss and breathe each kiss
They remind us of the joy we've known
Because they're young, because they're young
The stars are twice as bright above
Their dreams are new but they'll come true
Because they're young and in love
Just like me and you
Just like me and you
