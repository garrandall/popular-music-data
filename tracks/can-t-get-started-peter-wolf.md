Can't get started
Need a little motion
Somebody push me
And keep me movin
Over and over, I got the feelin
Been knocked down
And my head is reelin
Oh baby, hard to get started again

Need a little fire
Keep me burnin'
Need a little sparkin'
To keep my whole life turnin
Little by little, I got the notion
I'm like a ship wrecked sailor
Lost on the ocean
Oh, baby, it's hard to get started again

I got caught in a blind mans bluff
Feelin like the odd man out
Nine below zero with nothin to lose
Just hangin round the corner with these dead end blues
Late nite, all nite, dead end blues

Can't get started
Need a little motion
Feelin so shaky
Come on baby
Can't you hear me callin
Over and over, it don't seem fair
Runnin around in circles
And I'm gettin nowhere
Oh baby, it's so hard to get started again
Over and over, I got the feelin
Been knocked down
And my head is reelin
Oh baby, so hard to get started again
