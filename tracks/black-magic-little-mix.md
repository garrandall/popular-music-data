All the girls on the block knocking at my door
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more


Is your lover playing on your side?
Said he loves ya, but he ain't got time
Here's the answer, come and get it
At a knocked down price (Hey!)
Full of honey just to make him sweet
Crystal balling just to help him see
What he's been missing, so come and get it
While you've still got time (Hey!)


Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say


Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me
I've got the recipe
And it's called black magic
(And it's called black magic, yeah)
Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
It'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me
I've got the recipe
And it's called black magic
(And it's called black magic, yeah)


If you're looking for Mister Right
Need that magic to change him over night
Here's the answer, come and get it
While you've still got time (Hey!)


Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say


Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love (I'll make you fall in love)
For a spell that can't be broken (Can't be broken)
One drop should be enough (One drop should be enough)
Boy, you belong to me
I've got the recipe
And it's called black magic
(And it's called black magic, yeah)
Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
It'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me
I've got the recipe
And it's called black magic
(And it's called black magic, yeah)


All the girls on the block knocking at my door
I got the recipe
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more
Now you belong to me
All the girls on the block knocking at my door
I got the recipe
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more
Now you belong to me


Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me (Hey)
I got the recipe
And it's called, and it's called
And it's called black magic, oh, woah
Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
It'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me (Belong to me)
I've got the recipe
And it's called black magic
(And it's called, and it's called black magic)
