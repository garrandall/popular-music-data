When I am sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I am gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

I know it won't always be like this
Life can change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

And as the seasons change and time goes by
When your hair is gray and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today

Bring on tomorrow
I've got today
Bring on tomorrow
I've got today
Bring on tomorrow
Right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow
Because the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life
