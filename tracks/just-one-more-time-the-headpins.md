When we started open-hearted
It was me lovin' you, you lovin' me
Then we parted broken hearted
And now all the fun is through

You can't hide it, keep it quiet me needin' you
You haven't heard
Don't deny it, we can try it
I need your lovin' too

You had your hand in hers
You were smilin'
Oh baby don't you know it
I can smile all the while baby I'll be cryin'

Just one more time
I gotta feel your arms around me
Just one more time
Can't you feel the pressure mountin'?

Just one more time
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Just one more time
Can't you see what it's doin' to me

Oh what ya do
What you're doin' to me
I got the feelin' that you're runnin'
Run too far from me

No, I don't care if she's there
She ain't got nothin' on me
Oh, she can have ya
I just want you one more time, baby, listen to me

Just one more time
I gotta feel your arms around me
Just one more time
Can't you feel the pressure mountin'?

Just one more time
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Just one more time
Can't you see what it's doin' to me

No, I don't care if she's there
She ain't got nothin' on me
Oh, she can have ya
I just want you one more time, baby, give it to me

Just one more time
I gotta feel your arms around me
Just one more time
Can't you feel the pressure mountin'?

Just one more time
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Just one more time
I gotta see you, I gotta see you

One more time
Oh, oh, baby, oh, oh, darlin'
Just one more
One more time, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
