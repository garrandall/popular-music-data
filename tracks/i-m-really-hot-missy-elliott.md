Let me holla at the DJ
Come on DJ put that record on the replay
Don't you see how them bitches move they booty
Every time you play this record smell they coochie, follow them
Screamin' like a groupie
Misdemeanor move my nookie like a coochie
Fuck them haters, haters fuck whatever you say
Because you know I'm too cool for you anyway
I'm just a bad bitch
M-I-S miss
I'm gone keep talking shit till you get this
I'm gone bust up in the club with no guest list
The other artists I'll keep em' all restless
I don't french kiss, unless it's 50 Cent
Vivica we can share him like the president
Tabloids I don't care it's irrelevant
I'm heaven sent now watch how I do this shit


Ho!.....Ho (I'm..I'm..I'm..I'm)
Ho!.....Ho Go Go!
Ho!.....Ho (Hot..Hot.Hot,Hot)
Ho!.....Ho,Go Go!
I'm really, really hot
Every time my records drop
Radio says I won't stop
Cause I'm killin' em


You don't know what you talking bout
You would think I was Suge when I come out
My album hit hard when I roll out
Y'all records make a bitch wanna throw em out, and that's no doubt
See I rock bells, Fly as hell and cool as zinfandel baby can't you tell
I lick my lips like I'm LL
And I'm doin it & doin it & doin it well
Straight to the hotel
I'm sober bitch so boy you gets no tail
Kiss kiss and still you gets nowhere
Just two blue balls down in your underwear, I play unfair
I'm a hot gal, fly cars and stars in strip bars it ain't hot if I'm not there
I'm a true playa, you can find me up in any record store hurry up and get yours




Look, let me move to the left
Go Head, let me feel myself
Touch my chest my sweat
Show the DJ how I shake my breast
Jiggle, Jiggle, Jangle
Watch how my glu-te-us dangle
I do a one-two step STOP!
No I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt
I'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard
Haters I flip the bird, Got guns so what I ain't scurred
I came to boogy and swerve, Hang-line folk that's my word



Release...yourself
Release...yourself
