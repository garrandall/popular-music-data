Turn my fucking beat up 
(Turn my mic up to)
(Remix)


Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk everywhere and buy anything! (REEMIX)
Iâll be chilling, I donât worry about anything (REEMIX)
Why stop now? I can have everything! (Part 2)
Yeeeah! I can have everything!
Yeeeah! I can have everything!
Yeeeah! I can have everything!
Why stop now? I can have everything!


Find the nearest exit
Everybody better find the nearest exit
See the way I killed very nigga in this bitch
Somebody please tell me where the forensics
Everybody know the God real
Looking like you work in a garage sale
While you hating on one of the greatest
I be in the crib digging in ya momâs tail
Big old bitch â Avatar
I got her sitting on the dick like I handle bar
Shawty like the way I beat it up
Beat the pretty pussy with a battle scar
Let a nigga eat it up like a caviar
Got her buggin now she wanna carry on
YMCMB, gods of this rap shit that we are
But ya girl look like a little amateur
Wednesday night at the Apollo
But itâs okay âcause she got a long neck
And I got a dick size only a giraffe could swallow
Sent her back cause they gonna ask tomorrow
Why baby girl did you have to gargle?
If I could have everything
Do me a favour send me a hundred more bottles
Hahaha


Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk everywhere and buy anything!
Iâll be chilling, I donât worry about anything
Why stop now? I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Why stop now? I can have everything!


Aye let me re-introduce yaâll to my beautiful twin
Oh my God. MISSYâ¦


It go 3,4,5,6
On this mic I hot spit
This my time, toc-tic
Im the chick they not fucking witâ
Hit âem with hits in the head I spitâ¦
This shit is so ridiculous, sick
Missy like no other chick
Now watch how I kill this remix
I slay these crows
Got more lines than cornrows
You ain't on Missy level
Better get up on ya tippy toes
Really though? Really no!
Iâma blow it up like a torpedo
Who am I? You donât know?
You can call me the original
Iâm the E-double-LL I-O-T-T donât ever try me on the mic Iâma beast
Eat an emcee like Iâm finna have a feast
You better sit down, have a seat
I can do anything, Missy finna change the game
Yaâll better stay up in ya lane
Now Iâmma just make yâall clap ya hands




Itâs been officially declared that the martian is back in the building
TUNECHI!!!


Man, fuck these niggas
Man, fuck these hoes
T just roll a big long blunt
I smoke that bitch till itâs Muggsy Bogues
I ain't got time for that bitch shit
Glock, automatic, no stick shift
My girl pussy bigger than pig lips
My blunts last longer than friendships
Man, I was on my skateboard
It ain't trickinâ if you got it Iâll pay for it
Holâ up, wait for it
Ketchup, like fake blood
My own funeral Iâm late for it
Shout out to my young nigga Ace Hood
Iâm fresh out the can Iâm canned goods
Two handguns, my hands full
Iâm young ill and so mean
Iâm one pill from ODâing
Iâm high hoe, my eyes low like Koreanâs
I pulled up on that 
Thugginâ, bumping Golf Wang
Bitch, Iâm higher than Eddie Cane
Tunechi I can have everything
