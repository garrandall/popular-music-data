I've got a lot of memories to last the rest of my life
So if you don't want to love me baby that'll be all right
I'm gonna take all the lovin' that I have for you
I'm gonna take all the loneliness sit right down with the blues
I'm gonna give myself a party serve old memories
Give myself a party think of how it used to be
Remember all the happiness we once knew
Gonna give myself a party just me and the blues

Well a few of your love letters a photograph or two
A gift you gave on my birthday with words of I love you
There's a lots of things to think about when you're happy feeling blue
So I'm gonna take all the loneliness sit right down with the blues
I'm gonna give myself a party...
