I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
I got to find me somebody to love
Someone to love all the time
Keep off of my mind
I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
Is that forever I see in your eyes
Carefully planned like a dream
Just like a dream
I want someone to love (love)
Maybe it's you (love, maybe it's you)
Someone who will be true (love)
Maybe it's you (love, maybe it's you)
(Maybe it's you, maybe it's you)
But I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
But I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride
Whoa, no
