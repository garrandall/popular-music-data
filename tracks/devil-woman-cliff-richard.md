I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
And let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind, hind
(Stay away, you cunt)

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Trying to win you with Nymphetamine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
