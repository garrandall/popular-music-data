(Oh, no, I just can't stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)
I just can't stop dancin'

There's a place I eat lunch every day
Soon as I get there, the jukebox starts to play
I can't even eat my lunch in peace
'Cause music makes me get out of my seat

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, I don't wanna stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)

Music has a strange effect on me
It doesn't matter wherever I may be
Whenever I hear a drummer play that funky beat
I drop everything and get out of my seat

I just can't stop dancin'
(Oh, no, I just can't stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)

I just can't stop dancin'
(Oh, no, I don't stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no, oh)

Let me put this hamburger down
I don't want no malt
I wanna dance, oh yeah
Sho' nuff groovin' now, y'all, look at me
Huh-huh, oh yeah

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, you can't make me stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(I won't stop now, I just can't stop this)

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no, no, don't make me stop y'all)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, I'm not gonna stop)

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no, don't make me stop, y'all)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no, oh, no)
I just can't stop dancin'
