Shout out to 

Ugh, in Hallandale livin'
Miami, I'm feelin'
Fort Lauderdale chillin
We're poppin like villains
County line road
I was around all them killin's
Mirror ? Park, we acknowledge the ceilings
Ever since 7 I knew I was gifted
Started with niggas who cared for the vision
Shit ain't come easy, man nothin' was given
Went separate ways, now we back for the finish
Florida Man, Florida Man, we laugh from the benches
We shook off the jokesters, regarded the mentions
Focused on headlines to make up a story
Still come to vacation, we flexin' the story
My nigga Jeff got a daughter and Hyundai
We back on that bullshit, we said it'd be someday
This shit feel better, there's Snappers on Sunday
My niggas still trappin', they only know one way
When Trigga got shot, I found out on a Monday
Then told myself let me get back to my WOO!
I love a girl that listen to Gunplay and roll up my reefy and feed me dope like WOO!
She come from Carson or better yet Boston
She love my like Stella love Anthony, WOO!
Had do it my own thing
Went across state for the gold rings
Mission was to bring it back
Show 'em how to get to that
Niggas still tryna keep afloat, don't appeal to that
Homie called said the bills paid, but the rents past
Niggas in the pen, doin' 10 for a 10-sack
Rollin' up swishers, tryna see the bigger picture
Santa Monica, new views from the scripture
Checkin' in the comments, PayPal lookin' vicious
Everything I asked for, still in the trenches
Tell my momma hit a nigga on the back phone
Shiver in her face, what's that tone?
Grandmama passed last Tue, boy it's time to bring your ass back home
New flight, touch down,  with the medicine
Keep a nigga sane when I hit 'em with the presence
Pull up to the palace, county line for the residence
L's with the little bro, life is a fellowship
WOO! I feel I need a moment
Fuck it, this is my moment
On our way, this our moment
My city prevails, you look over us with a hideous smell
Neglected our obstacles, labeled us crazy
No that's what we not gon' do
Come to my city where niggas is thinkin much further than money and favors
Let's not go through all of these barriers
