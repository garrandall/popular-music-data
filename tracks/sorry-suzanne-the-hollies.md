I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry Suzanne believe me I was wrong
And I knew I was all along
Forgive me

I still love you more than ever
I'm sorry Suzanne for ever hurting you
You know I never wanted to
I'm truly sorry Suzanne

I could never ever justify
All the tears I made you cry
But I do regret it my Suzanne
You gotta believe me
I was lookin' 'round for someone new
What a foolish thing to do
All the time I knew it
Heaven knows what made me do it girl

I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry Suzanne believe me I was wrong
And I knew I was all along, all along



I'm truly sorry Suzanne

If you would only take me back again
Things would be so different then
What I wouldn't give for
One more chance to live for you Suzanne

I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry Suzanne believe me I was wrong
And I knew I was all along
Forgive me

I still love you more than ever
I'm sorry Suzanne for ever hurting you
You know I never wanted to
I'm truly sorry Suzanne
