(Word up son! Word!)
Yeah! To all the killers and a hundred dollar billas, billas...
(Yo I got the phone thing, youkno'msayin'?) (Keep your eyes open.)
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings... 
(Keep your eyes open! No doubt! No doubt son! I got this! I got this...)
(Just watch my back, I got this first. Yo!)
Check it out now!
(Word up! Say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murda'!)


I got you stuck off the realness - we be "The Infamous... "
You heard of us! - Official Queens Bridge murderers.
The Mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share.
For all of those - who wanna profile and pose!
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with' your nosebone.
You all alone in these streets, cousin.
Every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin',
And keep them shook crews runnin'. Like they supposed to.
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face! And in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up.
With bullet holes and such!
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched.
You can put your whole army - against my team.
And I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me! - You're minor!
We're major! You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight! My gunshots'll make you levitate.
I'm only 19 but my mind is old,
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold.
Another nigga deceased - another story gets told!
It ain't nothin' really. Hey yo, dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas.
Why they still alive I don't know go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation.
If I die... I couldn't choose a better location,
When the slugs penetrate - you feel a burning sensation.
Getting closer to God! - In a tight situation...
Now! - Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you.


 Son, they shook...
 Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks!
 Scared to death, scared to look!

They shook...
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks!
 Scared to death, scared to look



Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns.
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds. (earn funds...)
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns.
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones. (Havoc: Shook ones...)
 He ain't a crook son! - He's just a shook one. (Havoc: "Shook one...)

Word up! I am, I!
Youkno'msayin'? Ayo!


For every rhyme I write, it's 25 to life
Yo! It's a must the gats we trust safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation - that only leads to incarceration.
You don't know me - there's no relation!
Queens Bridge niggas don't play - I don't got time
For your petty thinking mind son! I'm bigga than those
Claimin' that you pack heat but you're scared to hold
And when the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is: "What, kid? "
You talk a good one - but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder - do I deserve to live
Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did.
No time to do, well on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you out o' line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin' - E&J, got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin' - think I'm how bizar to hold my hustlin'.
Get that loot kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'm a live illegal
And once I get on I'm a put on, on my people
React mix to lyrics like Macks I hit
Your dome up! - When I roll up don't be caught sleepin' cause I'm creepin'.


Son, they shook...
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
They shook! - Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks!
Scared to death, scared to look
They shook! - Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks!
Scared to death, scared to look
They shook! Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks



Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns.
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds. (earn funds...)
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns.
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones. (Havoc: Shook ones...)
 He ain't a crook son! - He's just a shook one. (Havoc: "Shook one...)


Yeah, yeah, yeah!
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billas
To real brothers who ain't got no dealings.
Big Prodigy! The whole Bridge! Queens get the money
41st Side! (He's just a shook one.)
Keepin' it real! (You know...)
Queens get the money...
