I got the hungries for your love,
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line.

Well, I ain't got nothin'
But the shirt on my back,
And an old two button suit
I walked outta my job
About a week ago,
And now I'm sleepin' in a
Telephone booth
But I'm a-gonna be
The richest guy around,
The day you say you're mine

I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Well, when I first saw you babe,
You nearly made me wreck
My ol' '49 Cadillac
I knew at a glance
That it was you for me;
I had to have your love by heck
I'm gonna follow you baby
Wherever you go;
I got nothin' to lose
But my time

I got the hungries for your love,
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line



Well, you made me
The top dog on your hill,
And I was overjoyed
But it didn't take long
'Til the thrill was gone,
I joined the ranks of
The unemployed
Now, I'm right back where
That I started from,
But that ain't gonna
Change my mind

I got the hungries for your love,
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Yeah, I'm waitin' in your welfare line
(Gimme a handout)
I'm waitin' in your welfare line...
