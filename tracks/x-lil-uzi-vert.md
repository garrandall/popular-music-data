Aye, I Just got rid of my boo
I Might just swerve in a Coupe
I Fucked your girls in my Coupe
Popping these Pills, Navy Blue, My Chain so Tight Like a Noose
Watch How we Flexin on you, Riding around we go "vroom!"
Riding Around With My Crew
Riding Around With My Crew
Riding Around With My Crew
I'm Riding Around With My Crew
Riding Around With My Crew
I'm Riding Around With My Crew
Riding around we go Rroom
Watch how we Flexin on You


Aye, Bitch I ain't checking On You
Aye, Lil Bitch I Pity the fool
Aye, Counting these bills, they be Blue
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose


Aye, I Just got rid of my boo
I Might just swerve in a Coupe
I Fucked your girls in my Coupe
Popping these Pills, Navy Blue, My Chain so Tight Like a Noose
Watch How we Flexin on you, Riding around we go Rroom
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose
Riding Around With My Crew
Riding Around With My Crew


I Am so sick, like the Flu
Getting money like a Jew
Spend a Hundred on my Jewels, Feel Like Santana With My Jewels
Thick White girl Right on my side, Yeah

I Leave you Wetter then a Pool, I Fuck you right there in your shoes
I Fuck you right there girl don't move, I Leave you right there girl don't move
I Flew around and I Groove

Aye, I Just got rid of my boo
I Might just swerve in a Coupe

Popping these Pills, Navy Blue, My Chain so Tight Like a Noose
Watch How we Flexin on you, Riding around we go Rroom
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose
Aye, Get the money snooze you loose

That is because I get now... I Can Afford too
Look At my money, My Nigga I Swear to God I Count Around You
