Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
And soon my tears they will be fallin' like rain
It always seems to be a Monday
Leftover memories of Sunday
Always spent with you
Before the clouds appeared
And took away my sunshine

Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
And I'll be dreamin' of you, baby, in vain
Your face is always on my mind, girl
I'm hopin' soon you're gonna find, girl
Your way back to me
'Cause if you say you'll stay
The rainy days will go away

Misty mornin' eyes
I'm tryin' to disguise
The way I feel
But I just can't hide it
People seem to know
The loneliness will show
I'm thinkin' of my pride
But breakin' up inside, girl

Oh, whoa, whoa

Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
And soon my tears they will be fallin' like rain
It always seems to be a Monday
Leftover memories of Sunday
Always spent with you
Before the clouds appeared
Took away my sunshine

Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
