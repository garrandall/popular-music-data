Everybody needs a someone
waitin' to be there when things are a-lookin' down
So if you feel a little lonely
Go out, find your one and only
Somewhere out there
Someone will care for you and then, 
never let her go
never let her go

You may wonder how you know love
when the moment comes that you've been a-dreamin' of
Well true love takes a little longer
Your heart beats a little stronger
You'll know it's real
inside you'll feel you're home at last 
Then, never let her go
Never let her go

So if you feel a little lonely
go out, find your one and only
Open your heart
Give love a start and watch it grow
And never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
