I've never heard a name, as quite as sweet as yours
I never saw eyes, as quite as bright as yours
I've never found love that can't grow old
And that is why, and that is why, I love you
So come on
You better come on step right on to my heart
You better come oooonn, to my heart
E'en a heart, as good and pure as yours
I've never seen a smile as true and bright as yours
I've never found love that can't grow old
And that is why, that is why, I love you
So come on
You better come oooon to my heart
Just sitting here thinking with a you on my mind
Don't go no where I'm worried all the time
Come on
You better come on come on into my heart
You better come ooonne into my heart!
