I hear a voice say, "Don't be so blind"
It's telling me all these things
That you would probably hide
Am I your one and only desire?
Am I the reason you breathe?
Or am I the reason you cry?


Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
I just can't live without you


I love you
I hate you
I can't get around you
I breathe you
I taste you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you


I feel like you don't want me around
I guess I'll pack all my things
I guess I'll see you around
It's all been bottled up until now
As I walk out your door
All I can hear is the sound


Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
I just can't live without you


I love you
I hate you
I can't get around you
I breathe you
I taste you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you


I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you

I left my head around your heart
Why would you tear my world apart?

Always
Always
Always
Always


I see the blood all over your hands
Does it make you feel more like a man?
Was it all just a part of your plan?
The pistol's shakin' in my hands
And all I hear is the sound


I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you
I breathe you
I taste you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you


I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you

I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I pick myself off the floor
And now I'm done with you
Always
Always
Always
