When this world that I see
Is too hard to take and too much for me
And everything's in blue

When the rain's pourin' down
I can't find the sun
Don't mean the sun can't found
It always comes through

There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day

As long as I can dream
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shinin'

And in my dreams I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream

In my heart there's a place
Where there's always hope
And always a way
To make it through the night

And in my soul, I believe
If I just have faith
Then I will be free
I'll be all right

There's not a soul that's lost (not a soul)
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day

As long as I can dream
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shinin'

And in my dreams I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream

Oh

There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long

As long as I can dream
(As long as I can dream)
There's a better world
I see it shinin' on me

(In my dreams I see)
In my dreams I see. yeah
There's a better world
As long as I can dream

(There's a better world, there's a better world)
I can see it
(I can see it shinin')
Yes, it's shinin' on me
(In my dreams I see)
In my dreams I see
(There's a better world)
Just as long as I can dream
