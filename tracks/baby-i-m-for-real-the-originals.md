Baby, baby
You don't understand
How much I love you baby
And how much I wanna be your only man, oh baby


Baby, baby, baby
You don't have to go
Stay a little while longer baby
I wanna talk to you just a little more


I see the little tears in your eyes about to fall
You are wondering if I'm for real
But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you, know why this is how I feel


Baby I'm for real
(Baby I'm for real)
(Baby I'm for real)


But if you wanna know the truth about it
Girl, I just can't live with out you
And that's why I'm confessing my love to you
So that I can live my whole life with you


Baby, baby, baby
(My whole life with you)
Don't leave
(My whole life with you)
Never, never, never, never gonna leave you baby
(My whole life with you)
Oh
(My whole life with you)
