Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the-

I'ma put these racks in your face
In your face, show you that you lame
I'ma stash these M's at my place
In my place, but no I'm not the bank
I'ma pull that coupe out the race
Who wanna race? We livin' the fast pace
I'ma put these hoes out on chase
Hit these hoes, get them right out my face
I'ma pull the strap close case
Hit a nigga hard, send him dat way
I'ma put the gang on your plate (gimme the plate)
You can't eat on my plate (no eatin')
Mount it up like the horse on Rari's (Skrr)
Beat that pop like ortishia (beat it)
Two feet running from the feds (yeah, 12)
All these niggas lookin like they scared (yeah, pussy)
Lock a fuck nigga like these dreads (yeah, pop 'em)
Pick a nigga off for that bread (yeah)
We can go there if you want to (where)
I'll come down if you want to (down)
Load up the rounds if you want to (rounds)
Hop out see what you gon' do (yeah)
We can go there if you want to (dere)
I'll come down if you want to
Load up on the rounds if you want to
Hop out gotta see what you gon' do
We don't play with dem lil boys out here naw naw naw (don't play)
Big boy bosses all in my seminar (bosses)
Big boy wraith had them bitches seein' stars stars (draith)
Stunt me out I don't need no rims on cars (hey, hey)
It's okay (okay)
Icing, icing glaze (Icing glaze)
I don't take breaks
Shit, I'm 'bout to go blaze? ('bouta go blaze)
What's yo' page (whoo)
Sliding on in like snakes (slide, slide)
The coupe got wings
The coupe got wings with blaze

Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture


The higher you go (go), went through the most (most)
We get to fly, you float (float)
No Malone, but I post (Malone)
Migos, you know we the goats (goat)
Bag of bread, call it loaf (loaf)
I shoot at that boy, then reload
Walk in the trap in the soul (walk)
My jewelry looking froze (ice)
Snatch your soul
Come to the north, then we snatch your gold (snatch)
I had to set up the plug the other day, boy, he was taxing folks (for what)
I do it for culture
Bigger than Oprah, Mayweather 50-0
Culture


Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture


(Offset!)
150 chokin' (choker)
Flooded my wrist, it's soakin' (flooded)
Split up the waters like Moses
I done put furs on loafers (fur)
Rolls Royce nightmare, I'm a ghost (Rolls Royce)
Let's have a codeine toast (toast)
NIggas ain't getting no stain on me
Don't trip, don't trip (don't trip), my gang with me
Come to the, stop playing with me
Bricks on bricks, it's raining keys (bricks)
Niggas can't hang with me
Lame in the deal, they restrain from me (dust)
Bust on the plane, Philipe (bust)
She bought me a Wraith, unique (Wraith)
You thots want to fuck in heat (thot)
A million, I bring home a week (M and M)
She a little beast (beast), fuck around looking for the keys (smash)
Got the trap disease (trap)
Please keep the cap for me (cap)
Count up the rack, proceed (rack)
First see what I got, then leave (hey)


Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
