Well I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight

And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
Well, c'mon, hold on tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light


Ain't no doubt about it we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen and we were barely dressed


Ain't no doubt about it
Baby, got to go out and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed


'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby, don't you hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
Well, I gotta let you know
No, you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes
I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well, I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
Well, c'mon, hold on tight


Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely


We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night


OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
There's the wind-up, and there it is
A line shot up the middle, look at him go
This boy can really fly
He's rounding first and really turning it on now
He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second
The ball is bobbled out in the center
And here comes the throw and what a throw
He's gonna slide in head first
Here he comes, he's out
No, wait, safe, safe at second base
This kid really makes things happen out there
Batter steps up to the plate
Here's the pitch, he's going
And what a jump he's got
He's trying for third
Here's the throw
It's in the dirt, safe at third
Holy cow, stolen base
He's taking a pretty big lead out there
Almost daring them to pick him off
The pitcher glances over, winds-up and it's bunted
Bunted down the third base line
The suicide squeeze is on
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close
Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it


Stop right there
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
Will you make me your wife?

Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
And will you make me your wife?

I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?


Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer in the morning


Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer in the morning

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer in the morning


I gotta know right now
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?
Will you take me away
Will you make me your wife?

I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?

What's it gonna be, boy?
Come on. I can wait all night
What's it gonna be, boy?
Yes or no?
What's it gonna be, boy?
Yes or no?


Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby, let me sleep on it
Well, let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer in the morning


I gotta know right now
Do you love me
Will you love me forever
Do you need me
Will you never leave me
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life
Will you take me away
Will you make me your wife

I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me
Will you love me forever


Let me sleep on it
Will you love me forever
Let me sleep on it
Will you love me forever


I couldn't take it any longer
Lord, I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god
And on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore I'd love you to the end of time


So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do (oh, oh)
Praying for the end of time
So I can end my time with you


It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better than it is today


It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
