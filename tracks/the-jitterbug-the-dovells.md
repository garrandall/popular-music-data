Can you dance?
Here's your chance
Throw back the rug
And let's jitterbug
The jitterbug is back again
The jitterbug, remember when
We danced to Kansas City blues
I'll go walk in my blue suede shoes
The jitterbug is back again
Let's jitterbug like we did then
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Get your girl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Start to whirl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Throw her out
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Shake and shout
Now that you know how
(Jitterbug)
It started with shake, rattle and roll
The next big dance was called The Stroll
Pony, Twist and Bristol Stomp, Madison
Hit the top, throw back the lights
Now rip back the rug, let's really rock
Let's jitterbug
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Get your girl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Start to whirl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Throw her out
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Shake and shout
Now that you know how
(Jitterbug)
Ah, come on now
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Get your girl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Start to whirl
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Throw her out
(Jitterbug, jitterbug)
Shake and shout
Now that you know how
(Jitterbug)
I like this whirl
Come on now
Now that you know how
(Jitterbug)
Ah, look at everybody dancing
Like they used to, come on
Let's dance now like we used to
Now that you know how
(Jitterbug)
