Some people say I'm a no-'count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural-born travelin' man

Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should


And I don't give a damn about a greenback
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailin' song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand

When I was a little baby
My mama said "Hey son,"
"Travel where you will and grow to be a man
And sing what must be sung, poor boy"
Sing what must be sung


Now that I'm a grown man
I've traveled here and there
I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song
The only ones who ever care, poor boy
The only ones who ever care


Some people say I'm a no-'count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural-born travelin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should


The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
