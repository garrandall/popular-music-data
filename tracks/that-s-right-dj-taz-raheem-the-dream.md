Got to make that money, honey

Business strict, damn strict

No stoppin' Stoppin', stoppin')
Stop knockin' (Knockin, knockin')
You mad, boy
Our hoes keep on jockin'
Snappin' Uh like a turtle
Out of line, me want Myrtle
Nasty dancers on your station
Uh-huh we be bassin'
Keep it crunk, keep it crunk
Play it loud in your trunk

First best, best last (Ohhh)
DJ Taz
Pump it up, don't stop
Till the planet rock
Pipeline in the mist
Sucka's can't fade this
Hits (Hits) that's all I make
Records (Records) that's all I break
Billboards is all I do
You know me, but I don't know you
Shake it down, at the show
What the bass, mids, highs, lows
I give you mo
Can't peel me, I ain't no ho
Who's slippin', who's snoozin'
Who's winnin', who's losin'
In the South we love that drop
Don't quit, don't stop
Little sumpin' from big Taz
For yo monkey ass

Yeah, we got Raheem up in here
Doin' something like this

Raheem gonna' rock this steady (Steady)
They ain't ready (Ready)

From Texas to V-A (Uh)
Detroit to G-A (Ah)
I gotta get my flow, can I go
Hit that ho at the show
I got some freaky bitches
They ain't gon' get no riches
Got animosity
They get the finger from me
Then try to diss it
Now they wit it
Gotta go and git it

Bestseller on the shelf
