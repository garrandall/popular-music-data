See how, I'm walkin'
See how, I'm talkin'
Notice everything in me

Feel the need, oh feel, feel the need in me
I need you by my side to be my guide
Can't you see my eyes are open wide, oh

Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
Ev'ry day I need it, ev'ry way I need it
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die
I need it constantly, your love takes care of me
You're always sweeter to me than applepie

Just put your hand in mine
Love me all the time
The truth you will plainly see
Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
I need you on the case to leave my heart in place
You make me what I need to be, hey

Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
Ev'ry day I need it, ev'ry way I need it,...

Your love is tough, now can't get enough, girl
Your love is so important to me
Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
I need you on the case
