Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby


Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right


Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye


What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)


Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You here, here to take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right


Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye


What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do

I’ve been waitin' up all night
Baby tell me what’s wrong?
You're gonna make it right, make it all night long
I’ve been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me, what’s wrong?
Going to make it right, make it all night long


Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye
