Outrageous
When I move my body
Outrageous
When I'm at a party
Outrageous
In my sexy jeans
Outrageous
When I'm on the scene
Outrageous
My sex drive
Outrageous
My shoppin' spree
Outrageous
We on a world tour
Outrageous
Let's be it, girl
Outrageous

Sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasin' me
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
All my girls still feelin' me

B girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Gotta keep goin'
No stoppin' me
And if you don't like it, then
La la la la la la la

Media, over here
Comin' through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

It's outrageous
When I move my body
Outrageous
When I'm at a party
Outrageous
In my sexy jeans
Outrageous
When I'm on the scene
Outrageous
My sex drive
Outrageous
My shoppin' spree
Outrageous
We on a world tour
Outrageous
Let's be it, girl
Outrageous

I'm about to bring the heat
Lockin' down the industry
All dressed up and glamorous
Red carpet and cameras

Take trips around the globe
Tints on my Jeeps so nobody knows
So hot, gotcha coming out ya clothes
I'm about to give ya the
La la la la la la la

Media, over here
Comin' through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

Outrageous

Outrageous
My sex drive

My shopping spree
Outrageous
We on a world tour
Outrageous
Let's be it, girl

I just wanna be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there
Somebody, oh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yeah
Until I vow to keep it forever

Outrageous
