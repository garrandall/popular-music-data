That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride

Start your journey
Early or maybe later
(Get your boots on)
Look for rainbows
(It's cloudy)
Take your hair-dryer, blow them all away

In you, I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you, I see all colours, not just black or white
In you, I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill, you're my supply of love and pride

That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and p-p-p-p-pride

Knowing, sensing
Seeing, eating, sleeping
(That's just being)
Touching and testing
Loving, wanting and taking more love and more pride

In you, I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you, I see all colours, not just black or white
In you, I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill, you're my supply of love and pride

That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride

I'm taking it 'round the world (world)
World
(I'm taking it round the world)
Some love and pride

That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
I say that's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride, oh
