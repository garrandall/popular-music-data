When a boy meets a girl
That he wants to get to know
He just walks right up to her
Introduces himself
Then he tells her so


But what does a girl do
When she meets a boy
Who makes her feel
The same way too
Somebody tell me
Tell me, tell me
What does a girl do?
(What does a girl do?)

And when a boy meets a girl
For the very first time
It's not wrong for him to say
"Darling, I want you to be mine"


Now she can't stand on a portico
And whistle when
She goes walking by, oh no no
She must hope that he can see

The lovin' light burnin'
In her eyes, oh yeah yeah
She can't ask him
To let her walk him home, oh no

Nor can she ask him
For the number
The number on his telephone, oh no

When a boy meets a girl, yeah
That he wants for the rest of his life
He just walks right up to her
And says, "darling, please be my wife"



Somebody tell me
Tell me, tell me
What does a girl do?
(what does a girl do?)
