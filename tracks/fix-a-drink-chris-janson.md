Well it's hotter than hell outside right now
It's 100 in the shade with the sun beating down
Forecast calling for some more of the same
Well I can't fix that but I can fix a drink

I turn on Fox news and then CNN
But it's the same dang thing all over again
The world's in the toilet and the market's in the tank
Well I can't fix that, no

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink

Say you gotta broken phone and a broken heart
The boss is on your back and your truck won't start
None of your friends want to listen to Hank
Well I can't fix that, no

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink

I don't know what's going on with you
But if you got some cheap whisky and some Mountain Dew
Malibu, Cuervo, Coke in a cup
Brother I can hook you up

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink
Yeah, I can fix a drink
