Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap


Man, I been did that
Man, I been popped off
And if she ain't tryna give it up, she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie
Bitch, bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off, no jokin'
Like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South, but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack
Like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat


Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap


Okay now Nicki Nicki Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this do-hicky
If I weren't rappin' I be trappin'
If I weren't trappin' I be pimpin'
If weren't pimpin' I be gettin' it, period
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from Ricky
Got your girl on Molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin'
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'
And if you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers
Got a private home, started from the public houses
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal
Audi A8, told them Audi 5000, uh


Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap


Damn, damn what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit?
If I get hit swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life

Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap


Man I'm out in Texas, man I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down
It's that New Orleans, it's LA or The Bay
It's New York, Philly, and the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit Player, man it's North/South Cack
Ohio, Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens Brooklyn and yea they're wildin'
The Bronx Harlem and Staten Island

Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap


Damn, damn what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit?
If I get hit swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
