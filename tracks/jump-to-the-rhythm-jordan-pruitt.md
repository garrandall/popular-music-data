Oh, Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do Yeah
Oh jump in
Woah-oh Yeah

I used to think that winning was for everyone else, yeah
But then he showed me a picture of
Me being myself yeah
You make me feel so special inside
Like there was nothing that I couldn't try
I'll always feel like a winner it's true
With you


You make me wanna
Jump to the rhythm
And step to the music
All in together lets show
How we do it
Step to the rhythm and dance
To the music
All in together we shine

Yeah,
Life isn't all so simple though
Tough choices to make yeah
Trying to keep everyone happy can
Be a mistake yeah

The time has come to be true to yourself
Stop chasing dreams made for somebody else
Deep inside there's a winner it's true
In you


You make me wanna
Jump to the rhythm
And step to the music
All in together lets show
How we do it
Step to the rhythm and dance
To the music
All in together we shine

Jump in to the rhythm
Step to the music
Say it all together to show
How we do it
Dancing to the rhythm
Dance to the music
All in together we shine

Jump in, hey
Jump out
Hey a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, oh
Turn around
Yeah now bring it up high
Yeah can you touch the ground
He's got it, She's got it
Everybody's got it

The time has come to be true to yourself
Stop chasing dreams meant for somebody else
Deep inside there's a winner it's true
In you


You make me wanna
Jump to the rhythm
And step to the music
All in together lets show
How we do it
Step to the rhythm and dance
To the music
All in together we shine

Jump to the rhythm and
Step to the music
All in together lets show how
We do it
Step to the rhythm
And dance to the music
All in together we shine
