(Back street)
(Back street)
I've been living off of Main Street
Where society is the thing
But people that live on Main Street
They don't know how to swing
But the people on the back street
They swing, all night long
Although I live on the main street
The back streets is where I belong
So, show me the back street
Show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, mmm, yeah
(Ooo) where people walkin' side by side
Without knowing each other's name
(Ooo) and soul is the only thing you need
To join right in and swing
Where people stick together
One for all and all for one
Where they don't care how much money you got
As long as you're havin' fun
So, show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, come on
Show me the back street, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on) mmm (show me the back street)
(Ooo) bein' a stranger in any town
Is a very lonesome thing
(Ooo) but if I find the back streets of any town
I know I'll find a friend
So, show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, baby
Show me the back street
(Come on) show me (show me the back street) show me the back street
(Come on show me) baby (the back street) come on and show me
(Come on show me) show me (the back street) the back streets, baby
(Come on) Mmm (show me the back street)
(Come on) yeah (show me) I know that (the back street) that's where it will be
(Come on) Mmm (show me the back street)
