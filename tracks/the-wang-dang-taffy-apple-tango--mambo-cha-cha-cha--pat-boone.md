They did the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
They did the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(How's it go) I don't know

Last night at Papa Joe's
My buddy met a lovely dove
She was the kind you never find
But keep on dreaming of
She did a dance
We never saw before
But sure did love

It was the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Heel and toe) I don't know

Oh la la la la

The crowd was tapping and
Clapping as the music played
His heart was right in time
With every little move she made
Though he was shy, she took his hand
And said, don't be afraid

Let's do the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
Mambo Cha Cha Cha

(Fast or slow) I don't know

Oh la la la la

He did a spin
And shook his shoulder
To get the zing of it
The sway and swing of it

But every time
He tried to hold her
She'd shake and shout Ole (ole)
Then go the other way

Now all night long
He did it wrong
But still it ended right
My buddy walked her home
And got a kiss and held her tight
So you can bet he'll be at
Papa Joe's tomorrow night

To do the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(To and fro) I don't know

Oh la la la la

Now all night long
He did it wrong
It ended right
They kissed goodnight
So you can bet he'll be at
Papa Joe's tomorrow night

To do the Wang Dang
Taffy Apple Tango
Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(How's it go)
I'm a no gonna say

Wang Dang Taffy Apple Tango
Tang Wang Mambo Cha Cha Cha
Wang Dang Taffy Apple Tango
