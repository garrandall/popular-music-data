EeeyiyiyiyiyahtheDoggPound'sinthehou-owwse (the bomb)
EeeyiyiyiyiyeahtheDoggPound'sinthehou-oww-owse
Snoop Doggy, Do-owww-ohhhh-oggg (the bomb)
Snoop Doggy, Do-owww-ohhhh-oggg (Dog)


From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin nuttin' back
And motherfucker, I got five on that twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cause I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta shit
What's my motherfuckin name?


Snoop Doggy Dogg
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Dah dah dah dah, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, dah dah


It's the bow to the wow, creepin and crawlin
Yiggy yes y'allin, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfuckin house like everyday
Droppin shit with my nigga Mr Dr. Dre
Like I said, niggas can't FUCK with this
And niggas can't FUCK with that
Shit that I drop 'cause ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin cop
Tic toc never the Glock just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem bloodclots
Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
'Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (who?) Doggy (what?) Doggy 


Snoop Doggy Dogg
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Bow wow wow yuppie yo yupie ye
Bow wow wow yuppie yo
Bow wow wow yuppie yo yupie ye
Bow wow wow yuppie yo yo yo yo


Now just throw your hands in the motherfuckin air
And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care
Yeah roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your step (why?) 'cause Doggy's on the gank
My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch, is where ya might find me
Layin that, playin that G Thang
She want the nigga with the biggest nuts, and guess what?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfuckin name?


Oh, Snoopy Dogg, Snoopy Dogg, Snoopy Dogg (the bomb)
Yeah yeah (Dog) I know his name
C'mon Snoopy, c'mon Snoopy (the bomb)
And the Dogg Pound
Snoopy Dogg (the bomb) Snoopy Dogg
Snoopy Dogg (Dog)
(Dog, nasty dog, doggy dog)
