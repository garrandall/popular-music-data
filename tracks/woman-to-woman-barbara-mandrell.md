Hello?
You don't know who this is but...
The reason I'm calling you is because...
I was going through my man's pockets this morning...
And I just happened to find your name and number...
So woman to woman, I don't think it's wrong to call
Now, I don't know how you're gonna take this...
You might even hang up the phone...
But, you see, it really doesn't make any difference...
And it's only fair that I let you know
That "that man" you've been seeing...
He's mine... and I love him
So woman to woman I think you'll understand

Woman to woman
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman
Now if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too?

Woman to woman
I've just got to make you see
Woman to woman
That you can't take him from me
Woman to woman
I just can't step aside
And let you take what is rightfully mine

Woman to woman
Right or wrong
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home
I hope you understand...
I love that man...
And he's mine

Woman to woman
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
Woman to woman
Now if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too?
Woman to woman
I've just can't step aside
And let you take what's rightfully mine
