I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me
I can't kick this feeling when it hits?
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

Sometime, don't you feel like you
Never really had a love that's real?
Well, here I am and who's to say?
A better love you won't find today
Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other, two steps above
On your ladder I'll be a peg
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
