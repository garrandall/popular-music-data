Do, do do do do, do do!
Do, do do do do, do do!

Make, someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to!
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One girl you're everything to!

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the 'real-stuff' in life to cling to?
Love, is the answer
Someone to love, is the answer
Once you've found her
Build your world around her!
Make, someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
And you will be happy too!

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute . .

Where's the 'real-stuff' in life to cling to?
Love, is the answer
Someone to love, is the answer
Once you've found her
Build your world around her!
Make, someone happy
Make just one, someone happy
And you will be happy too!

You'll be happy too . .
You'll be happy too . .
Hm . .

Do, do do do do, do!
Do, do do do do, do!

~ from the Broadway production "Do Re Mi"
