I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
