Well you're out in California digging the sun
Writing home to everyone
Six in the morning and here it comes
It come and hit ya

Don't let that California earthquake scare you away
Don't let that California earthquake scare you away

The ceiling came down and knock you out of bed
You try to stand up but have rubber for legs
Earthquakes just ain't good for your head
Especially when they hit ya

Don't let that California earthquake scare you away
California earthquake, don't let it scare you away

My advice to you is to keep your feet off the ground
As long as you're flying you won't tumble down
California's still the best place around

Don't let that California earthquake scare you away
California earthquake, don't let it scare you away

California earthquake, don't let it scare you away
