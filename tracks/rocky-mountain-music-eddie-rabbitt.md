Back upon an old dirt road 
Next to a swamp full of toads
Was a slanted wood shack with three little kids and a mama

Papa died in '63
Left little Jenny and me
To plant those taters and pull up another tomorrow

Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Papa, can I hear you playing for me?

Little brother was never quite right
He used to sit on the floor in the sunlight
Play with the dust that danced on the beams in the window

And sister had to cook and clean
'Cause Mama, she got sick and lean
Sometimes I think she just died away missing Papa

Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Mama, can I hear you singing to me?

Well, everything has changed today 
And little brother, he was taken away
And sister, she married a soldier and lives in Toledo

And me, I'm in a Nashville bar 
And I've never been so far
From that old gravel road and the rivers that run through my memory

Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Brother, can I hear you calling me?

Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Papa, can I hear you playing for me?
