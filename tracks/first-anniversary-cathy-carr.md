Look at you, look at me
See the way we glow
Who'd believe that we
Just met one week ago


This is our first anniversary
Gee, the time went fast
This is our first anniversary
But with every kiss we know
We know it won't be the last
(It won't be the last)

Take my hand, hold me close
It's a special date
Goodness knows we've got
So much to celebrate



When we met, when we danced
I just knew somehow
We'd be here this way
And you'd be saying now



It won't be the last
(It won't be the last)
It won't be the last
(It won't be the last)
It won't be the last
(It won't be the last)
