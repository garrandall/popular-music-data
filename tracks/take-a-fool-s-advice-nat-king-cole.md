If you love her
And she makes one mistake,
Please don't leave her
It would make your heart ache.
Take a fool's advice,
Don't pay the price I had to pay.

If you need her
But you're letting her go,
Please don't do it
You'll be sorry, I know.
Take a fool's advice, 
Don't pay the price I had to pay.

Truly,
She's caused you to doubt her,
Truly,
She's broken the rules.
But life's not worth living without her,
So listen to the wisdom of a fool.

Think it over
And forgive her this time,
I was foolish
I lost the love that was mine.
Take a fool's advice,
Don't pay the price I had to pay.

Take a fool's advice,
Don't pay the price I had to pay.
