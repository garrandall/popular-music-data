Now girl I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere

Now let's get outta this town, outta this club
Girl whatever you're sippin' I'ma mix it up
Take a few tick-tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop
I got that

1994, Joe Diffie comin' out the radio
I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your Pick-Up Man
How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose
'Bout to bust out my honky-tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie

Girl don't you worry none, your ship just came in
So go on tell your mama, tell all your friends
That your new favorite color is John Deere green
Hop in this truck aka Time Machine

1994, Joe Diffie comin' out the radio
I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your Pick-Up Man
How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose
'Bout to bust out my honky-tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie

Baby if you're lookin' for a good time
Let me take you to the C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
Now baby let's go, holler if you're with me
Hey Joe, come on and teach us how to Diffie

1994, Joe Diffie comin' out the radio
I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your Pick-Up Man
How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose
'Bout to bust out my honky-tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Will the real Joe Diffie please stand up
