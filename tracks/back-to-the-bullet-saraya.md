Lately I find myself driving past your house
Past the bar we used to go, whoa
Anywhere that you might be
Oh, that's where my body leads me
Oh, it's the only place I know
Gonna follow where it leads me
Even if I don't wanna go

Here I am, back to the bullet
Shoot me down again, I want you to
Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't run from you

Heard it all before and I know I'll hear it again
"He's no good, better stay away"
But every night when I picture us alone
Oh, the words just fade away
Holding on to yesterday

Here I am, back to the bullet
Shoot me down again, I want you to, oh
Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't run from you

Run from you
Whoa, c'mon, baby

This is where I belong
Been running from the truth too long

This is where I belong
Been running from the truth too long
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't, this time I won't
This time I won't run from you

(Back to the bullet)
Oh, I won't run from you
No, no, no, no, no, no
I won't run from you
Whoa, whoa, whoa

(Back to the bullet)
I won't run from you
I won't run from you
(Back to the bullet)
Hey, hey, yeah
(Back to the bullet)
Hey, hey
I won't run
(Back to the bullet)
