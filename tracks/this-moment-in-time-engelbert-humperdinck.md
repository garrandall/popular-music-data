More than a ripple, less than a splash
The heir to a long line of glory
Give me the morning and I'll give you a song
It's so good being part of the story

This moment in time
This right time of day
Oh I love being with you
And watching my life at play
My love in your eyes
Is lighting my dreams
And the feelings you choose
Have touches of blues and greens

This trip into time
This timeless embrace
And like a kid in a store
I'll always want more to taste
And no matter what comes
I know the sun is gonna shine
Because of you and me
There'll be this moment in time

And no matter what comes
I know the sun is gonna shine
Because of you and me
There'll be this moment in time

More than a ripple, less than a splash
The heir to a long line of glory
Give me the morning and I'll give you a song
It's so good being part of the story

This moment in time
This right time of day
Oh I love being with you
And watching my life at play
And no matter what comes
I know the sun is gonna shine
Because of you and me
There'll be this moment in time
