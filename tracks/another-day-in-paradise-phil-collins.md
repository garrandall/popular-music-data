She calls out to the man on the street, "Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep. Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back, he pretends he can't hear her.
He starts to whistle as he crosses the street, seems embarassed to be there.

Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you and me in paradise.
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you, you and me in paradise.

She calls out to the man on the street, he can tell she's been crying.
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet, she can't walk, but she's trying. (trying)

Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you and me in paradise.
Oh, (oh) think twice, (oh) it's just another day for you, you and me in paradise.

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anyone can do?
Oh oh Lord, there must be something you can say..

You can tell from the lines on her face, you can see that she's been there.
Probably been moved on from everyplace, cause she didn't fit in there.

Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you and me in paradise.
Oh, (oh) think twice, (oh) it's just another day for you, you and me in paradise.
Just think about it, ohh.....

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me ohh....
