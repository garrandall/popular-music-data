I've loved you for as long as I remember
And I know I'll love you all of my life
I'll try to stay with you
Oh, yes, I'll try

'Cause you got the power to satisfy me
But there's always something new about you out of reach, oh

Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, oh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul

Ah, you're a lady, you're my world
Come on and speak to me
Ah, you gotta help me now
To find the right key

Major to minor
Keep it in step
Let me hear, you got to teach me
Your sweet harmony, oh

Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, oh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul

All over the world there are so many you have gifted
And they give me inspiration every day
You're my way of life, yeah, oh

I know that we will always stay together
And I will love you strong
'Cause you've got me flyin'

On the wings of a song, hey

Look on the floor now, take me higher
Give it to me one more time and let me pass it on, oh

Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, woo
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, woo

Music (whoa..) sweet music
You're the queen of my soul

Music (music) sweet music (sweet music)
You're the queen of my soul
Music (music) sweet music (sweet music)
You're the queen of my soul (yeah..yeah..)

Music, sweet music (oh..)
You're the queen of my soul (the soul music)
Music (yeah..hey..) sweet music
You're the queen of my soul

Music (yeah, yeah) sweet music (oh..yeah..yeah..)
You're the queen of my soul (queen of my soul)
Music, sweet music (sweet, sweet music)
You're the queen of my soul (music, you gotta pass it on)

Music, sweet music (don't you keep your music to yourself)
You're the queen of my soul
Music (music) sweet music (ooh..)
You're the queen of my soul (ooh..yeah..yeah..)
