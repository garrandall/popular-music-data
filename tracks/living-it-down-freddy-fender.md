She's taking it easy
I'm taking it hard
She's got it together
I'm falling apart

She's having a time now
Out painting the town
She's living it up now
I'm living it down

Every day I find
She's still on my mind
But I guess
She don't ever think of me

And I'd give all I own
If she'd just come back home
And forgive the fool I used to be

Ella no me quiere
No se donde esta
Y tal vez masana
A mi, volviera

She's having a time now
Out painting the town
She's living it up now
I'm living it down
