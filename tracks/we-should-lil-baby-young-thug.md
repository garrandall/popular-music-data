Shit, nigga just goddamn snatched one of his daughters, now she trippin'
You tellin' me, nigga, that ain't burn out now? What's up? (Wheezy outta here)


Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million (Woo)
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children (Yeah)
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my (In what?) chameleon (Yeah)
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million (Yeah)
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at (Woo)
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back


Wrist a Honda Civic, Lamborghini arms (Lamborghini)
We get plenty pussy (What?), nah-nah-nah-nah (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
Don't you call me with it (Don't you call me with it)
Boss nigga, we don't talk 'bout chickens (Brr, brr), nah-nah-nah-nah
My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I'm God
Don't ask me 'bout no such-and-such, don't speak about no charge
I just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band
Too much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man
Some shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask
I don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask
Treat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags
Wish I would've answered for the homies that I can't call back


Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million (Woo)
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children (Yeah)
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my (In what?) chameleon (Yeah)
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million (Yeah)
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at (Woo)
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back


My dawg just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up
I can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up
Had a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck (What?)
Red guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup (Hey)
All my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed (Woah)
Thought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette
But he on the yard with the old dawgs, they a wreck (Huh)
I missed a court call, what they said?


No more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read (Yeah)
And this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it (I play it)
Cartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' (Yeah)
Keep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family (Woo)
None of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances (Woo)
I don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance
Blood on these diamonds, they look good, they dance
Big truck pull up like a blue ambulance


Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million (Woo)
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children (Yeah)
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my (In what?) chameleon (Yeah)
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million (Yeah)
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at (Woo)
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
