I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care cause you've got something I can share
Hey, take a chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the
Light of your second sight because
When you understand me
You might feel good around me now


I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around


I won't turn you out if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realise
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination


I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
I don't want your love, I don't want your love


Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
I like noise cause, I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down. I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me
You might feel good around me


I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around


Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
