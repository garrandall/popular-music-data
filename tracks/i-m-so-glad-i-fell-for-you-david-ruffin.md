Yesterday my life was filled with sadness
I had little hope of ever, ever finding gladness
All my roads were closed
And marked with never, never, nevermore
I had accepted my life to be just a bore
Whooohooohoooooo
All I did was sit at home
And watch and search for tomorrow
That was the only thing from life
That I thought I could just borrow
But now my life has changed
As the world turned, it's rearranged
'Cause I found sunshine, yes I did, ha
Had shone over the dark hill
Wooooooooww


Oh, I'm, I'm so glad, so glad, I fell for you
I wanna say I'm, I'm so glad, so glad I fell for you
What I wanna do is thank you baby, thank you
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
'Cause you knew what, you know you knew what to do, baby
Oh yes you did


Oh, baby now, all I wanna do
Now, all I wanna do now, is do for you, baby
Whatever, whatever you want me to
Oh, you know I'll do for you, baby
I wanna thank you, baby, thank you, baby, thank you, baby
'Cause I know, I know you knew what to do in the beginnin', baby
Oh, yes you did; oh, yeah

Feelin' faint from
Fears of yesterday's battles, oh yeah
Tryin' hard to mount a horse
I couldn't even saddle
Girl, believe me when I say
I've got to, got to, got to hand it to ya;
Your love gave me a fresh start
When I thought I was through
Whaaaahoooooooooooooh!


I'm, I'm so glad, I'm so glad I fell for you
I wanna say, I'm, I'm so glad, so glad I fell for you
What I wanna do is
Thank you, thank you, baby
Whaaaaahoooo!
I know you knew what to do, baby
Whoa yes you did, whoa yes you did
Oh! Oh!

I'm, I'm so glad, I'm glad I fell for you
I wanna say, I'm (whaa-whooo)
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad I fell for ya
I wanna thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Whaaa-whooo!
Thank you 'cause you know you knew what to do in the beginnin', yes you did
Oh, yes you did, baby
Oh, oh oh, whoooooooooooooooooooo
I'm so, so glad, so glad I fell for you, baby
Say it again, whooohooooo
I'm so glad, I'm so glad I fell for you
What I wanna do is thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Thank you
