When I met you, you meant the world to me
But you were the type of girl that set love free
Now I'm out cold, you stole my heart from me
But I know someday you'll think back every memory

Chorus:
Now what will I do
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you

Now love is gone
You're far away from me
You would have been so rich with love but set it free
Now you want home but it's too late for me
'Cause I won't be used and abused and then set free
