He took a hundred pounds of clay
And then He said, "Hey, listen"
"I'm gonna fix this-a world today"
"Because I know what's missin' "
Then He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did


With just a hundred pounds of clay
He made my life worth livin'
And I will thank Him every day
For every kiss you're givin'
And I'll thank Him every night
For the arms that are holdin' me tight
And He did it all with
Just a hundred pounds of clay
Yes he did, whoa-oh, yes He did


Now can'tcha just see Him a-walkin' 'round and 'round
Pickin' the clay uppa off the ground?
Doin' just what He should do
To make a livin' dream like you


He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did
With just a hundred pounds of clay


People, let me tall ya what He did
With just a hundred pounds of clay
