Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans to a cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing

I think its one of those dÃ©jÃ  vu things
Or a dream that's trying to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinking about it
I don't know, I doubt it

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Misses Princess who?

Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when I caught up
With a past-time intimate friend, she said
"Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me."

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone

She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do
I feel for her, I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
