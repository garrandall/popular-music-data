Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
Never, never never 

No 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
No no no never 

Momma said never be a quitter 
Never since I was young 
Never been in my roots 
Dont let never make you a bum 
Never my only so she said 
Never beggin for crumbs 

If never found out your slippin 
Then never might be a gun 

Never think suicide 
Never steal 
Never lie 
Never run up to a gun 
Fight and think you gone survive 

Never that lil 6 nuts 
6 is for the flies 
Never become a snitch 
If you would rather be a quiet 

Never know em 
Never met met em 
Never seen that fella 
Never never never 

When they put you in that room 
Thats what you tell em 
Hell never to the law 

Never I'm a be a star 
Never catch me up to mar 

Never worry 
Never bury 
Tears on your teen jersey 

Keep it 42 be worthy 
Never go without the curry 

Never the greatest of all time 
You in a hurry 
Never its too early 
Never have no mercy 
Never 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
Never never never 

No 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
No no no never 

Never cross a man as far as you can throw em 
Never put ya fate at home 
Boy y'all know em 
Never get in the herd 
Never get into church 

Never cook in your life 
Buried 6 feet under dirt 
Never hate 
Never envy others 
Cause they getting cake 
Never grind 
Never hustle 
Never see your dinner plate 
Never be fake 
Never be a snake 
Never play that shit dog 

Till they bring that pepper spray 
Never be scared 
Never hurt your head 
Never cause if they was killers you would already be dead 

Never pout 
Never ever have doubt 
Never that be the reason 
You still sleep on mommas couch 

Never brag 
Never be stingy with cash 
Never get in for business 
Mind your own 
Take em now 

Never cry wolf 
Never daddy ma boo 

Never less than a survivor 
Never 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
Never never never 

No 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
No no no never 

Dont be slick 
Never silent 
Dont be bricks 
Never 
Get your wig split 
Never rob your click 
Never 
Never miss your blesses 
Never start second guessin 
Never get to heaven never cause you missed the lesson 

Never bite the hand that feed 
Never live in greed 
Never succeed 
Never doin dirty deeds 
Never chunk 

Never give up on your hope 
Under pressure dream big 
When its rough make a toast 

Never sell your sole 
Never for some dough 
Never diamonds 
Never pearls 
When you die 
Never go 

Never back down 
Never let your hat down 
Never see no bully 
Let them know your background 

Never cross the line 
Never cross your kind 
Everyday let it be 
Never worry 
Never toss your mind 

Never lose sleep 
Never cause you got beat 
Never know peace 
Never when you in these streets 

Never 
Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
Never never never 

No 

Never give up 
Never hold you head down 
Never fear no man 
Never trust anybody 
Never say you cant 
No no no never 

Never never never
