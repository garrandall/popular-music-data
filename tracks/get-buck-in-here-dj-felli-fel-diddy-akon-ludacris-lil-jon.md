Chyeah!
It's that incredible shh...
Talk to 'em
It's to many beautiful lady's in the house tonight Felli
Hey!
I think you need to hit 'em of some..
OK!
Woow!

They call me Diddy
DJ Felli Fel
Testing 1,23 (testing 1,2,3)
Check this out
Listen to me (Listen)


It's tricky I'm picky baby, but I just spotted you
Doin' your thing, g-string, shoe string point of view, hey
Lend me ya body, you got me in a zone
Bet a million in a half past, I can make you explode
You don't wanna brave the cold, you wanna Diddy Combs
I can take you on outer-limits away from home
(Where ya bills at, prolly wollin fo sho)
In the middle of the club doin' a rodeo show (Hey!)
The hoes seem schemey, wet dreamy, emphasism obsessed gleemy
(Incredible sex) you need me
Ease me, please me baby, I maybe am little crazy but in a way that...


Don't make me get buck in here
Shorty drop 'em to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And don't make me get buck in here
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
You the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that grandam
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
Just shake that thang, shake that thang


She can make it clap like a standin' ovation
Spin like my record at the radio station
Feel the sensation, I put it right there
They be like LUDA, I be like yeaaaaaaa,
You like it like that don't cha baby
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good, like Tiger Woods
And I ROWR like a tiger would
My livelihood, is not hollywood
I'm still southside atlanta, thats a lively hood
A circus, big top, like ringling brothers
If you wanna learn something, bring your mothers
Sit back and observe, invite some friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the celly with a couple of twins
Cuz tonight, damn right, we gonna do it again


Don't make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop 'em to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And ima get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
You the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that grandam
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
Just shake that thang, shake that thang


Listen, women lace 'em G4 jets, flyin'
Twisted, crooked, cell phone numbers, private
Flip 'em change 'em, prissy and boogy the hood
Game of taste 'em, prissy's I'm runnin' 'em good
Leather or silk, I'm melt them all
Love 'em, leave 'em, give 'em hell for sure
Tell them words they minds and souls deserve
Or give them things they might prefer
Sandrio pan, mandarin sweet massage oil
Pimp, gamein', grants, and benz' I tried 'em
Used to style 'em, now just virgin island
Kamasutra freaky ...


Don't make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop 'em to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And ima get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
You the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that grandam


Hold up, hold up
Yo, yo, yo
It's your boy Lil' Jon right? (yeah!)
They try to take this thing to another level!
Let's go
Let me see ya get your hands up
Let me see ya get your hands up
Let me see ya put yo drinks up
Let me see ya put yo drinks up
Now git buck in this..
Buck in this..
Buck in this
Buck in this
Crunk in this
Crunk in this
Crunk in this
Crunk in this
Hey!
