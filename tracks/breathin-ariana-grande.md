You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten Iâm at a 100
Never get enough, I canât stay away
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it


Every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby


You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'll always be the same
When you call for me
I'm right there, I'm right there


One less, one less


One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home


This is the part where I say I don't want you
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part where I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more


If you wanna keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta love me harder


Something 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Something 'bout, something 'bout, something 'bout


And I'm so into you
Into you, into you, into you


We're gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright


Been here all day
And boy, you got me -


Making bad decisions


Greedy, ooh
You know that I'm greedy for love


When raindrops fell
Down from the sky
The day you left me
An angel cried


Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up


God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman, one
It lingers when we're done


You can feel it, feel it


Say goodnight and go


Some days things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
Just keep breathing and breathing and breathing and breathing
You know you gotta keep on, keep on breathing


The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole


Excuse me, um


It feels so good to be this young and have this fun
And be successful, I'm so successful


Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things


N-A-S-A


Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored


I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah
Forget about him, yeah
Forget about me


Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah
Just wanna have a good time, yeah
And no need to apologize


With a fake smile


I can be needy
Way too damn needy
I can be needy
Tell me how good it feels to be needed


Imagine a world like that
A world like that
Imagine a world like that


Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
And for that, I say
Thank you, next


We were on honeymoon avenue


Thank you, next


Ain't got no tears left to cry


I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex


We're gonna be alright


Thank you, next


I been on the road, where you been?


Thank you, next
Thank you, next


I love the way you make me feel
