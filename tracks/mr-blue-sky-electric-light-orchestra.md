Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin', everybody's in the play
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day, hey

Runnin' down the Avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city on the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long, so long
Where did we go wrong?

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long, so long
Where did we go wrong?

Hey, you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for, ah ah

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long, so long
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there Mr. Blue, we're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey there Mr. Blue, we're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Mr. Blue Sky, Blue Sky Blue Sky, Mr. Blue Sky

Mr. Blue you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over, now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind, I'll remember you this, I'll remember you this way

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long, so long
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there Mr. Blue, Sky, we're so pleased to be with you, Sky
Look around see what you do, Blue
Everybody smiles at you
