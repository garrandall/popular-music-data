I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open up every time she smiles
And when I come home to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song


she gives me love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love crazy love...

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come home to her when the sun goes down
She takes away my troubles, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache in the night like a thief.



She's got love love love love crazy love
Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms around her
To kiss her, hug her, kiss her, hug her tight
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me such sweet lovin' brightens up my day
And makes me righteuos and makes me whole
And it makes me mellow down to my soul
