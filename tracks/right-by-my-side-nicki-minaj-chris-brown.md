It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You don't know, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart oh, boy

I-I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh-oh

I-I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh-oh


Let's meet at our favourite spot
You know the one, right around the block
From the nice place, that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Care to sit down? Let's talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand
Make you laugh again, I need to be near you

Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, and she just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart girl


I-I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh-oh



I can't eat ah, ah, ah, ah
I can't sleep ah, ah, ah
What I need ah, ah, ah
Is you right by my side


I can't eat ah, ah, ah, ah
I can't sleep ah, ah, ah, ah
What I need ah, ah, ah, ah
Is you right by my side


It ain't your spit game
It's your dick game
That got me walking 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with 'em when the Lakers on
Other than that I'm getting my Marc Jacobs on
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it'd be a wrap
When I'm riding it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone
'Cause all them bitches is ratchet
And now let me get in my truck
'Cause all them bitches'll catch it
Wait wait wait, damn there I go again
I be trippin', I be flipping, I be so belligerent
Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant
I don't even remember though I was probably hella bent (let's go)


I-I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh-oh


I can't eat ah, ah, ah, ah
I can't sleep ah, ah, ah
What I need ah, ah, ah
Is you right by my side
