Now red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinkin' from glass

Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable
In fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not foreclosable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass, woo!

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup, I lift you up,
Proceed to party, proceed to party

Now I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them, to help me get lucky

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup, I lift you up,
Proceed to party, proceed to party

Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you red will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott into my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
(Here we go now!)

Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
you're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say,
"Red solo cup, you're not just a cup (No, no, God, no)
You're myâyou're my friend, yeah (Lifelong)
Thank you for being my friend."

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup, 
Wow! What up? What up? 
I lift you up,
Proceed to party, 
(Let's have a party)
Proceed to party
(...them mother...)

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
Let's have a party, let's have a party
Red solo cup, I lift you up,
Let's have a party, proceed to party

Solo cup
Solo cup
Solo cup
Solo cup
Solo cup
Solo cup
Solo cup
