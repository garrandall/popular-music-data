Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

Baby, baby
Can't keep me on hold
Don't you make my
Blood run cold

Found out the hard way
I was surprised
Looks like it's gonna be
Another round of lies

Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

I can see the smile
On your pretty face
The sun came out
There's light in every place
Light in every space

Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

Got to see the smile
On your pretty face
The sun came out
There's light in every place
Light in every space

Baby, baby
Can't keep me on hold
Don't you make my
Blood run cold

Found out the hard way
I was surprised
Looks like it's gonna be
Another round of lies

Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

I can see the smile
On your pretty face
The sun came out
There's light in every place
Light in every space

Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah

Baby, baby
Can't keep me on hold
Don't you make my
Blood run cold
