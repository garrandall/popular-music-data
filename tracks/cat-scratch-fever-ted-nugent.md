Well, I don't know where they come from but they sure do come
I hope they comin' for me
And I don't know how they do it but they sure do it good
I hope they're doin' it for free


They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever


Well, the first time that I got it I was just ten years old
I got it from some kitty next door
An' I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure
I think I got it some more


They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
I got a bad scratch fever
The cat scratch fever


It's nothin' dangerous
I feel no pain
I've got the choo-choo train
You know you got it when you, you're going insane
It makes a grown man cry, cry, oh won't you make my bed

Well, I make the pussy purr with the stroke of my hand
They know they gettin' it from me
They know just where to go when they need their lovin' man
They know I'm doin' it for free


I give them cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
They got a bad scratch fever
The cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever


Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
