I know she says she wants me
I hear it every day
And I know she know it keeps me
Well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart must be made of stone
Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone

She says
Who said I would
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of loving
Oh then she sets me free
But she's got a heart must be made of stone
Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone

She says
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would
Who said I would, who said I would

I'm not the only one but I do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

Tell me
Who said I would, who said I would

But she's got a heart must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone

You're not the only one but you do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
I don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should

Who said I would (who said I would)
Now she knows when she calls me
I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot
But she don't know it's her body never mine

And she's got a heart must be made of stone
Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone
She says
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would
Who said I would, who said I would
