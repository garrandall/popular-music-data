After dark the shadow people walk
It's another world
Playing Valentino, trying to get a kiss
From the trendy girl
It's that lipstick game
Captured by a look from her x-ray eyes
She looked right through my best disguise

Drinking gin and tonic anything but shy
She took me by the hand, whispered with a sigh


I want you to stay, don't go away
Here comes the night
Stay don't be alone, so far from home
Here comes the night

Walking in the dark through the park
Where the lights are low
She took me by surprise with her x-ray eyes
They're the kind that know
Touched by her affections what social dame
Shoulda known she was a player in the lipstick game

Drinking gin and tonic anything but shy
She took me by the hand, whispered with a sigh
