Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love, love
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes feel alright
Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love no, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Cause money can't buy me love whayooooo

Can't buy me love everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love no, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Cause money can't buy me love whayooooo

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
