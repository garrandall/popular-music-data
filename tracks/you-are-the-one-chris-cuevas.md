Girl, just take my hand
And pull me close to you
The love we have is true
Like a candle in the night
You are my light, my life
And I will burn for you

What you are to me
Girl, I will always need

Come, walk along with me
And tell me how you feel
You know my love's for real
Please don't leave me now
I'll make it work somehow
I promise, starting now

What you are to me
Girl, I will always need

(CHORUS):
You are the one that makes me laugh
You are the one that makes me cry
I could go on and on and on
But that would do nothing if you're gone

Come and sit down by my side
Tell me it's alright
We'll make it through the night
Please don't shed a tear
I'll always love you dear
We'll last a million years

(CHORUS)
