I hope she cheats on you with a basket ball playa
Hope that she Kim Kardashianed her way up. 
Don't know the difference between a touchdown and a lay-up got you on
Viagra in order for you to stay up


I may sound bitter I'm a little bitter
Just a little bitter because you were with her. 
I'm Salt Lake City now I'm on up out the picture. 
Remember how it was when I was with ya.


Baby sex so good do you remember. Ohhh 
Well Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that I'm without you)

I hope she cheats on you with a NFL balla.
She ignores ya every single time you call her.
Brand new Louie gotta have it spend ya money on her.
When you wanna hit it she acting like she doesn't wanna.


I may sound bitter I'm a little bitter
Just a little bitter because you were with her.
I'm Salt Lake City now I'm on up out the picture.
Remember how it was when I was with ya.


Baby sex so good do you remember. Ohhh 
Well Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that I'm without you)

She cute and all but that won't last forever.
What I had for you was so much better.
Yeah the grass aint greener on the other side of town, now look at how it all turned out now.
I'm a little bitter just a little bitter but I'm doing better cause we ain't together.
Ya sorry excuse for somebody I was into
Remember what it was when I was with you.


Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that I'm without you)
