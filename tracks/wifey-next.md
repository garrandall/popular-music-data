You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey
Make my life complete
Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey


This you should know
'Cause you had my mind blown, oh, oh
Da jump, at the club on bump, like what
I had to have you babe
Saw you outside, passenger side
'Cause I let my best friend drive
You was in line
That's when you caught my eyes girl


You were so beautiful, girl (Beautiful)
It was so critical, girl (So critical)
You looked so crucial, girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine


You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey
Make my life complete
Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey


You know you're sexy too
I like your attitude
I ain't even mad at you
Girl, you're still my boo
Either braids or weave
Skirt or jeans, you're still my queen
Baby-girl, go do your thing
I'm so glad you're on my team


You are so beautiful, girl
It is so critical, girl
You look so crucial, girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine


You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey
Make my life complete
Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey


Someone I can spend my life with
Leave the keys to the Benz
Wedding band with the gems
You're someone I feel all right with
Someone to have my kids
The one I can depend on


You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey
Make my life complete
Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey


Skinny designer fit real jiggy
Ain't afraid to hump with me when we get busy
Ride out, I licky-licky 'til I get dizzy
Toes done, fresh scent, I think it's sizzy
Hoes, none, she was the one down with me
Used to struggle, now we bubble, countin' G's with me
Pop the champagne, let's take a sippy-sippy
Describe you, I try to
You're my wifey


Will you be my wifey?
(Yes, I'll be your wifey)
Say you'll be my wifey
(Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes, I'll be your wifey)
Say you'll be my wifey
(Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
