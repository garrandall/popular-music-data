Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a teardrop all of the way
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Loving a bad guy is such a sin, yeah
He's got me all won
Can I get him?

Nothing but a heartache every day yeah
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a teardrop all of the way
(Nothing but a teardrop)
It is one situation that I just can't win, yeah
He's got me all won
Can I get him?

I got a lot of those heartaches
I got a lot of those teardrops
Heartaches, teardrops, all of the way
Nothing but a heartache every day

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a teardrop all of the way
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Him loving me is just too slim, yeah
He's got me all won
Can I get him?

I got a lot of those heartaches
I got a lot of those teardrops
Heartaches, teardrops, all of the way
Nothing but a heartache every day

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a teardrop all of the way
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Him loving me is just too slim, yeah
He's got me all won
Can I get him?

Nothing but a heartache every day yeah
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a teardrop all of the way
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Heartache, oh, I get 'em every, every day
(Nothing but a heartache)

Tears pouring all down my face
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Oh, the man has got me, so uptight
(Nothing but a teardrop)
Nothin' I do, seem to
