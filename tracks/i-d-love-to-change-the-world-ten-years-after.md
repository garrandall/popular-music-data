Everywhere is
Freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies
Tell me, where is sanity?


Tax the rich
Feed the poor
Till there are no
Rich no more


I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you


Population
Keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding
Still more feeding, economy


Life is funny
Skies are sunny
Bees make honey
Who needs money? No, not poor me


I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you


Oh yeah!


World pollution
Is no solution
Execution
Electrocution
It's black and white
Rich or poor
Them and us
Stop the war


I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
