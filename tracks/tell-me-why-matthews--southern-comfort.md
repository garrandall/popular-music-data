Sailing hard ships through broken harbours
Out on a wave in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing along in his pride
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell

Tell me lies later come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile
Tell me why...
