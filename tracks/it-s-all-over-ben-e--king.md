When the night 
Has gone 
And the land is dark 
And the moon 
Is the only light we'll see
No I wont no I wont be afraid 
Just as long as you stand stand by me 


You're way to beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work 
You left me suicidal suicidal 
When you say its over 


Stand by me 
Woow stand by me 
Wont you stand 
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me 
Woow stand by me 
Wont you stand 
Stand by me 
Stand by me 

I wont cry 
No I wont 
Shed a tear 
Just as long as you stand stand by me 
So all in darling stand by me 
Woow stand by me 
Wont you stand 
Stand by me 
Stand by me 


Your way to beautiful girl 
(stand by me woow)
That's why it'll never work 
(stand by me woow) 
You left me suicidal suicidal 
(stand by me stand by me) 
When you say it's over 
(stand by me stand by me)


Cause you're way to beautiful girl
