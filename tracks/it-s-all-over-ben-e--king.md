Outside her window
That's where I am
Every night and every day
And outside her window
I cry my life away

There's a jukebox playing
Just a half a block down
Saying I'm going to the river
Gonna jump right in and drown

But I ain't gonna do that, girl
No, no, I'll just on hanging around

Even though it's (all over)
Can't you hear me (all over)
Don't you leave me (it's all over)
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)

Outside her window
A pretty bird come to play
And I know I cried, I cried a tear
I must have scared that pretty little thing
That pretty little thing away, yes, I did

When I see two young lovers
Walking down the street, yes, indeed
Whoa, how it kills me
When I see their two lips meet

Then I pass my hand right over
Where my heart once used to be

And you know it's (all over)
I wonder, do you believe me (all over)
I don't think you understand me
(It's all over) oh, yes, it is
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)

I've got to say it
Just one more time now
(Yes, it's all over)
Soembody help me tell myself
(All over) yes, it is
(It's all over)
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)
(Now, now, now, now, now, now)
