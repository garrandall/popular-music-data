You were sitting by your window
Just looking up at the moon
Your eyes shined so bright
Like stars in the night

As I watched you
Yes, I watched you from below

And I said
Hello, pretty girl, pretty girl
Won't you come out tonight
Take a look at yourself
Sitting up there alone
Now that's not right

Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone

Now I'm going to keep talking
Even if it takes all night
Cause I made up my mind
That you're gonna be mine

As I watched you
Yes, I watched you from below

And I said
Hello, pretty girl, pretty girl
Won't you come out tonight
Take a look at yourself
Sitting up there alone
Now that's not right

Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone

Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone

(Pretty girl, pretty girl)
Come on, girl
(Pretty girl, pretty girl)
I love you so
(Pretty girl, pretty girl)
Come on with me
(Pretty girl, pretty girl)
Walk with me
