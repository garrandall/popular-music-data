Stop, look what you're doing to me
Oh, stop, stop it, baby
Look what you're doing to me

Oh, I've cried so many nights
Can't seem to dry
Oh, I can't seem to dry my weeping eyes
I can never find another love

That's why you hear me say
Stop, look what you're doing to me
Oh, stop, stop it, baby
Look what you're doing to me

You got me worrying my life away
I tell you I can't hold
Oh, I can't hold my head up high
Sometime I feel like I just wanna die

Will I ever quit saying
Stop, look what you're doing to me
Oh, stop, stop it, baby
Look what you're doing to me

There's no other way I'll be satisfied
I won't ever leave, I got to
Believe you're coming home soon
But until you do, I still love you

Please, please, please, please
Stop, stop, stop
Look what you're doing to me
Oh, I just can't take it no more

I think you better
Stop, stop, stop
Look what you're doing to me

Oh, stop, stop, stop
Look what you're doing to me
Oh, look what you're doing to me

Stop it, stop it, stop it...
