Ah, the bells are ringin'
For me and my gal
Ah, the birds are singin'
For me and my gal

Everybody is knowin'
Ah, to a weddin' they're goin'
And for weeks they've been sewin'
Every Susie and Sal

Ah, they're congregatin'
For me and my gal
The parson's waitin'
For me and my gal

And someday
I'm gonna build a little home for two
For three or four or more
Ah, in Loveland for me and my gal

Yeah, whoa

Ah, they're congregatin'
For me and my gal
Ah, the parson's waitin'
Ah, for me and my gal

Yes, someday
I'm gonna build a little home for two
For three or four or more
Ah, in Loveland for me and my gal

Woooh, whoa

Come on, pretty baby, whoa
