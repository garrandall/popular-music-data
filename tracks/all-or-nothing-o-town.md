I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older


You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair


'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all


There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it


Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell


'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing


'Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never


Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all
Or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all


All
