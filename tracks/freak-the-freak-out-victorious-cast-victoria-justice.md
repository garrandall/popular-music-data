Are you listening?
Hear me talk, hear me sing
Open up the door
Is it less? Is it more?
When you tell me to beware
Are you here? Are you there?
Is it something I should know?
Easy come, easy go


Nodding your head, don't hear a word I said
I can't communicate
When you wait, don't relate
I try to talk to you, but you never even knew
So, what's it gonna be?
Tell me, can you hear me?


I'm so sick of it, your attention deficit
Never listen, you never listen
I'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit
Never listen, you never listen
I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now is freak the freak out (hey)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh


Patience running thin
Running thin, come again
Tell me what I get, opposite, opposite
Show me what is real
If it breaks, does it heal?
Open up your ear
Why you think that I'm here?


Keep me in the dark, are you even thinking of me?
Is someone else above me? Gotta know, gotta know
What am I gonna do? 'Cause I can't get through to you
So, what's it gonna be? Tell me, can you hear me?
(Can you hear me?)


I'm so sick of it, your attention deficit
Never listen, never listen
I'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit
Never listen, never listen
I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now is freak the freak out (hey)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh


Easy come, easy go (Hey)
Easy come, easy go
(Can you hear me?)


I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now is freak the freak out (hey)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh


I scream your name
But you never listen
No, you never listen
But you never listen
