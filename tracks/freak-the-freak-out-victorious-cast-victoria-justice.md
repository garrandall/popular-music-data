You had it all the day you told me (told me) you want me
I had it all but let you fool me (fool me) completely
Yeah I was so stupid to give you all my attention
'Cause the way you played me exposed your true intentions

And one day I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah one day I'll have you crawlin' like a centipede
You mess with me and mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day you'll be beggin' on your knees for me

So watch your back 'cause you don't know when or where I can get you
I've set the trap and when I'm done
Then you'll know what I've been through
So oh, Mister Player, do you feel like the man now?
And I bet you're nervous 'cause this song makes you freak out

And one day I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah one day I'll have you crawlin' like a centipede
You mess with me (yeah) and mess with her (yeah)
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve (yeah)
Yeah one day you'll be beggin' on your knees for me

I know I'm being bitter but I'mma drag you under
'Cause you just don't, don't deserve "Happy ever after"
For what you did to me after you told me you never felt that way
It was only just a game

(You had it all)

(And one day)
And one day I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
(Beggin' on your knees for me)
Yeah one day I'll have you crawlin' like a centipede
(Crawlin' like a centipede)
You mess with me (yeah) and mess with her (yeah)
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve (yeah)
Yeah one day you'll be beggin' on your knees for me
