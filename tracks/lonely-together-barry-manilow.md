Your eyes are sad eyes
Mine are too
It doesn't take too much to see
What we've been through
You lost your baby
Me the same
Ain't it true how love's a hurtin' game
Could I have this dance
May I be so bold
It's just my heart is empty
And the night is so cold


Wouldn't it find bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be find havein' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mind
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone

A heart that's hurtin's
It's not hard to see
I guess he promised you the world
Like she did me
But dry your eyes now
You'll be just find
We can drown our achin hearts in this glass of wine
Well I hate to say
What's done is done
It's just two can ease the pain
Much better then one



Love
It's such a crazy thing
All you got to give and no regrets
But love it can live again
Stay with me tonight
I'll make it work out right
