Have you ever been swindled by a swindler who lies?
Cause he wants to see you smile, have a good time, be inspired
And he doesn't want for you to cry or know he cries inside
So he hides behind his great triumphant rock and roll disguise
You want things to be real but you really can't deny
You feel excited and on fire, is it wrong to lie and say he's fine?
When the reason he's not fine is the pressure of the power changing lives
In just one hour all these people will be better people 

Take this job and shove it, adios, I'm a ghost
I am leaving for the coast and I'll never work for anyone again
I'm not your saviour or your heavenly host
I'm just a piece of zweiback toast getting soggy in a baby's aching mouth
I'm going south, like the geese I just goosed you
And so maybe I seem loose to you but I don't even wanna spoon
I did once, but I don't now
Now that I see how you do things, the way you play and sing's amazing
But the way you play the game is crazy, you don't have to say you're sorry
You don't owe me anything, don't owe me anything 

Sometimes it seems like I've got all the answers
But the answers aren't the same when the questions keep on changing
Like how will I react when I see my mother crying
Every single day cause she is afraid of dying?
And how will I contain my anger when delilah
Plays unchained melody instead of lost in your eyes?
And where will I go where I can feel safe
When my family sells this place and we all split up and move away? 

I'm trying to be brave cause when I'm brave other people feel brave
But I feel like my heart is caving in

I'm trying to be brave cause when I'm brave other people feel brave
But I feel like my heart is caving in

I'm trying to be brave cause when I'm brave other people feel brave
But I feel like my heart is caving in
