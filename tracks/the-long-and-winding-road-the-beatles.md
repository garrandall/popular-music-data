The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door


The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way


Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried


And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
