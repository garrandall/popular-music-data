The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
(Washed away)
Has left a pool of tears
Oh baby
Crying for today
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
(Let me know the way)

Let's hear it, let's hear it

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To that long, winding road
(Winding road)
You left me standing here
Oh, baby
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
No baby
Lead me to your door

(In these changing timesâ¦)
(In these changing timesâ¦)

(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
(Stray away)
(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
Never never never
(Never gonna stray)
I'll never stray away
(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
No no no never
(Never gonna stray away)

(In these changing timesâ¦)
(In these changing timesâ¦)

But still they lead me back
To that long, winding road
(Winding road)
You left me standing here
A long, a long time ago
Ohh, don't keep me waiting here
Oh, please
Lead me to your door
(Lead me to your door)
