Tatou o tagata folau e vala'auina
E le atua o le sami tele e o mai
Ia ava'e le lu'itau e lelei
Tapenapena

Aue, aue
Nuku I mua
Te manulele e tataki e
Aue, aue
Te fenua, te malie,
Nae ko hakilia mo kaiga e

We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze
At night, we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are, who we are

Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Aue, aue
Te fenua, te mālie
Nā heko hakilia
We know the way
