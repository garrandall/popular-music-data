I can't wait to get home to you
I got so much work to do, work
I'm taking care of business baby can't you see
I goota make it for you, and I gotta make it for me
Sometimes it may seem boy I'm neglecting you
But I'd love to spend more time
But I got so much to do

Oh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got work to do, I got a job yeah
I got work to do, said I got work to do

Oh I'm out here trying to make it baby can't you see
It takes a lot of money to make it let's talk truthfully
So keep your love light burning
Oh you gotta have a little faith
You might as well get used to me coming home a little late, oh

Oh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got work to do, I got a job yeah
I got work to do, said I got work to do

I can't wait to get home to you
I got so much work to do
