I'm just riding, sliding, let's take a little trip
CMG and K and we finsta make a grip
Coming straight from out the O, so you know, that
(We got the funky track that's phat)
But anyway it's my turn so let me introduce
Special One first up from the gangsta crew
Known as TCD with a title and a rep, it's quite apparent
Serving funky shit to keep you motherfuckers staring
Pump it up, mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear, making hoes disappear
Hittin' donuts in a tre' sideways, to the
Next light, triple gold thangs and my shit's tight
Five deep mobbin' through in The Town
Deuce Tone, Gangsta Flake with the top down
Damn, this shit's hittin' hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills I'mma never stop
Kicking that shit you love
Pass the dank and a drank for the bitch to buzz
It's a ghetto thang so I bring the ghetto slang
Hookin' niggas like the 'caine when I do my thang
Five real G's mobbin' on a mission
Check it, it's the funky expedition that we call a little something to ride to


Expedition, funky expedition


Come and catch a thrill with the super skill rhyme flowing
Daughter on attack with the knack to keep your speakers blowing
Riding with a gat in my lap and one finger on a Zap
Looking for some niggas in a Cadillac
Yeah, we on point, rollin' a point
Special One and CMG blazin' up a joint
Keepin' a steady pace in a car race
Sidin' on a strip with a grip and an eighth in my glove case
Never leavin' a trace, but leaving the 5-O's blind
'Cause I'm fucking conscious of these streets of mine
Rollin' lit with the tint shed shallow
And I'll be back around the block for niggas to jock tomorrow
From East O to the B town, looking for a freak now
With hella scratch to get at
Check it, CMG on a mission
To get with some niggas to ride on this funky expedition

Yeah, Conscious Daughters
All up in your trunk
Somethin' to ride to, feel that shit, yeah
A yo, K, why don't you step up and that ass know
Check it


Foothill Boulevard, the bumpy ass strip
Homies steady clownin' on the gas, brake, dip
It's a conscious groove, making all my daughters move
Rollin' through the town with big bass boom
Let's get bigger on these niggas up the street
Jock 'em for a minute let 'em take us out to eat
But I concentrate on all my niggas later
I flow to this shit 'cause I'm Special One the greater
But it's this funky that got me gripping still like this
Come into my show, if you fine, you may kiss
Don't mess with the bomb, I never stress no tension
Come kick it with the Daughters as we take you on a funky expedition
