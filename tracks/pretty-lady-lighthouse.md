I see you each morning
And in silence I say
Pretty lady, I love you
But I know there's no way
That you'd consider my love, girl
'Cause you don't have the time
So I try to conceal it
So you can't read my mind

But all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you
Yeah, all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you

Every day I keep hoping
That I may see a sign
That'll give me a chance, girl
To be first in your eyes
But I just go on waiting
Every day it's the same
And all my friends keep on saying
You're a fool who loves pain

But all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you
Yeah, all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you

I'm beginning to wonder
If you know I'm alive
Every day it gets harder
To feel good when I rise
If I'd just get the chance, girl
You would feel what it's like
To be loved every morning
Every day, every night

'Cause all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you
Yeah, all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you
Yeah, all I want to do, pretty lady
Is see you smiling too, pretty lady
Maybe once in my life be making love to you
