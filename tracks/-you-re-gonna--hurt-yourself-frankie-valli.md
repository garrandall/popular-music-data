I love you, just you, it's true (Baby, it's true)
But how much more do you need to be satisfied
Than I can give, the way you live (Baby, can give)
You cheat all over, the rover you are
Makes me tell you


Oh, girl (Yeah)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself (Hey)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Don't call me


Don't call me late, don't wait, 'til it's too late (Baby, it's true)
If you want my love, take my love, but don't go shoppin'
Round town 'til you have found (Baby, can give)
The guy you needed was me all along


Baby, baby, oh, girl (Yeah)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself (Hey)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Don't call me
I love you

Girl (Yeah)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself (Hey)
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Oh, call me
I love you


Girl, don't hurt yourself
Girl, come on now girl
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
Come on, girl
