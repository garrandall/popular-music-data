Don't you know I saw you, baby
As I passed you by
Don't you know I caught it
With a gleam in your eye, yeah

I know that you want me, baby
This you can't deny
You know that I want you, baby
Please don't say goodbye

I'm the one that needs you, baby
Tell me that's no lie
You know that I want to, baby
Why can't we give it a try
Good, good times for you and I

Just let it come now, baby
Let your colors show
Just let it come now, baby
Let the feeling grow

Now let it flow
Gotta let it flow
Yeah, let it flow, yeah

We got a good attraction, baby
Just a you and a me
Don't you try and hide it, baby
Come on and set me free

I know that you feel it, baby
I can feel it too
And though I try
I just can't hide
This ain't nothing new

Let's not waste
These precious moments
They're so very few
I don't wanna lose it, baby
Oh, and neither do you
Good, good times for you and I

Just let it come now, baby
Now's the time to groove
Just let it come now, baby
Now's the time to groove

Time to groove
Time to move
Yeah, there's no time
To lose, yeah

Just let it come now, baby
Let your colors show
Just let it come now, baby
Let the feeling grow

Just let it come now, baby
Let your colors show
Just let it come now, baby
Let the feeling grow

Just let it come now, baby
Let your colors show
