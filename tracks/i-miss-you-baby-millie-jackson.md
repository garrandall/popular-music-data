I've life the life
Of a many things
Drink wine with tramps
And I dine with thieves

I've done most anything
A woman could do and exist
But til I met you, baby
There was something I had missed

Yes, there was
I missed the two of us
Sharing each other's heart
I missed the joy of love
Right from the very start

I missed your tenderness
The way you hold my hand
But most of all, I missed
The love of my man

Many a girl have gone my way
Got lost in the race
They went another way
Ashamed to show their face

That's why I'm gonna love you
In the darkness of the night
Run my hand across your chest
Let you know everything's alright

Squeeze you gently
With a tender touch
Say, aw, baby, when
You had a little too much

Treat you like a woman should
Each and every way
And when you're gone from home
You'll always hear me say

I missed the two of us
Sharing each other's heart
I missed the joy of love
Right from the very start

I missed your tenderness
The way you hold my hand
But most of all, I missed
The love of my man
Ooh, baby

I miss you, baby
(I missed the two of us
Sharing each other's heart)
Don't you know I miss you, baby
(I missed the joy of love
Right from the very start)

I waited too long for you, baby
(I missed your tenderness
The way you hold my hand)
Cause most of all, I missed
The love of my man, yeah

I miss you, baby
(I missed the two of us
Sharing each other's heart)
Can't you see I'm back here
Missing you, baby, yeah, yeah
(I missed the joy of love
Right from the very start)

I can't do without you, daddy
(I missed your tenderness
The way you hold my hand)
Cause all this time
I missed the love of my man...
