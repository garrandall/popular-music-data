You take a bus marked "Lakewood Drive"
And you keep on drivin' till you're out of the city
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin pine
And the countryside's pretty
And you'll see daffodils peepin over
The hills or a honey lovin' mama bear

You just take a left at the bridge
Go down to Quakerforn Ridge
And in a minute you're there
(dupe do be do do do )

Indian Lake is a scene
You should make with your little one
Keep it in mind if you're lookin to find
A place in the summer sun
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove
Or you can rent a canoe at Indian Lake
You'll be able to make the way the Indians do
