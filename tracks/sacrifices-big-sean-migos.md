Brrrt!
I look up, so many (on my don shit)
So, so many
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you


I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah


Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that "Marvin and Chardonnay"
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need


I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah


I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life
Look, I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life


Offset!
I done sacrificed the thug life, diamonds shining ain't no dull life
Drop my top to get my mind right, pull up in the 'Rari, loud pipes
Bitch, I'm the don, my wrist a hundon (Patek)
Oh, yeah, Gucci python
Oh, yeah, she play with her tongue
Yeah, I bought that bitch a new charm
Lit nigga pop one
I told her come see about me (come on, come see me)
The devil had entered my soul
My momma had beat it out me (the devil, my momma)
Remember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody
Hop in my seats massaging (ayy)
Watch how I lead the posse, I made an M deposit


Paid all these dues with the game (yeah yeah)
Sacrificed yo stripes for that stain (sacrifice)
Heard you sacrificed your life for that chain (yeah yeah)
She sacrificed that money for cocaine (white, phew, coco)
Left hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one
Bad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something
That's gonna wanna make your friends come
Make way with the tommy gun
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Ten toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy
Just some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy
People watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy


I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah


I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take
I'ma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy
I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts
And the human race is all about pacing
Look at all the ones I outlasted
I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classified
'Til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
