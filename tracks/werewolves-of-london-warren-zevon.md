I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein


Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!
Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!


If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again


Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!
Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!




He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim
I'd like to meet his tailor


Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!
Aa-hooo! Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!


Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen
Doing the Werewolves of London
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen
Doing the Werewolves of London
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect!


Aa-hooo!
Werewolves of London!
Aa-hooo!
Werewolves of London!
