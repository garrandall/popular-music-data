I helped you with your problems
You oughta help me with mine
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
Just gimme some kinda sign

You wanna be a lady scholar
You oughta know what to say
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
We can't go on this way

Any major fool down on 42nd street
Will tell ya dere's no way to beat da heat
You're a little younger maybe I'm a little old
I never said it but I need to be told

Whoa-oh

Whoa I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Yay I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Ooh I got to know, I got to know, I got to know

You communicate with silence
You expect me to understand
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
You can make me a happy man

While I'm waitin' for your answer
I'm sleepin' in my shoes
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
'Cause I wanna go spread the news

Any major fool down on 42nd street
Will tell ya dere's no way to beat da heat
You're a little younger maybe I'm a little old
I never said it but I need to be told

Whoa-oh

Whoa I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Yay I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Ooh I got to know, I got to know, I got to know

So if you think ya need me
Just give me a little call
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
What's on your mind, what's on it

But I'm tired of all this waitin'
You sweet-talk me to death
Whoa I got to know, I got to know
So I better not hold my breath

Whoa I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Yay I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
Ooh I got to know, I got to know, I got to know
