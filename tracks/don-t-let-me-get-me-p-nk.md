Take Y 
Take the letter 
Take it out on the alphabet 
Dont ask me why 
No more questions 
Just accept it for the way it is 

Words are just words 
They get in my way 
I can never say what I wanna say 
Who will understand it anyway? 
It's just a waste 

Take M 
Mmm mmm 
It's so lovely, so delicious, it says it all 

I don't like X 
Ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends 
Exactly what I don't need 
Twisting my words so easily 

Words are just words 
They get in my way 
See like right now, I wanna tell you that I love you 
but I don't know how.. 

Put the H with the A with the TE, 
give it power, you could destroy me 
Put the L, with the O with the VE, 
Give that power and you don't have to say anything 

Words are just words 
They get in my way 
Bla bla bla bla 
Blaaaa 

Words are just words 
They get in my way 
Words are just words 
They get in my way 

Take B, 
and just let it be, B...
