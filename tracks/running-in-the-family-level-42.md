Our dad would send us to our room
He'd be the voice of doom
He said that we would thank him later
All day, he was solid as a rock
But by eight o'clock
We'd be crumbling

One night, my brother Joe and me
Climbed down the family tree
That grew outside our bedroom window
We ran, though we knew it couldn't last
Running from the past
From things that we were born to be

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre

Dad rang the officer in charge
A man so large
He barely fit his circumstances
He said two kids out on the street
Were picked up on the beat 
And in the station

So there's me, with Emily and Joe
Daddy driving home
All heading in the same direction
He knew, no matter what the breaks
We'd make the same mistakes
Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
Looking back, it's so bizarre

Like a dream within a dream
We're all somewhere in between
Like a drummer plays his drum
Like a father, like a son

And your gonna have to face the music, oh yeah
Face the music

Hey hey, we keep it running in the family
Hey hey, we keep it coming in the family

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre, whoa yeah
Running in the family
Running in the family
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre, whoa yeah
Running in the family
