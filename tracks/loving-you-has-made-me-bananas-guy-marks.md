Verse 1
Oh, your red scarf matches your eyes
You closed your cover before striking
Father had the shipfitter blues
Loving you has made me bananas
Verse 2
Oh, your red scarf matches your eyes
You closed your cover before striking
Father had the shipfitter blues
Loving you has made me bananas
Bridge
Oh, you burnt your finger that evening
While my back was turned
I asked the waiter for iodine
But I dined all alone
Verse 3
Oh, your red scarf matches your eyes
You closed your cover before striking
Father had the shipfitter blues
Loving you has made me bananas

(Return to bridge)
