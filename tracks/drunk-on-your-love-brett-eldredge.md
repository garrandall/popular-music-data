The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, on your love
On your love
On your love, on your love
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk
