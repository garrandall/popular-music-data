Oh yeah
Oh yeah


Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe
Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no


Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight


"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact, I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night


Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine


Bad guy


Your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy


Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight


Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight
