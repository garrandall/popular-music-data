The days of autumn splendor
Those moments warm and tender
Was it too beautiful to last?
The love we shared together
The dreams we dared together
Was it too beautiful to last?

Walking hand in hand
The dawn discloses
We were dreaming of a land
Where love reposes
But castles made of sand
Like winter roses
Are fated to die
My darling, like you and I
My darling...

Where are those sweet Septembers
The joy my heart remembers?
Lost in the shadows of the past
The rainbow arched above you
The sacred words, I love you
Why did that dream go by so fast?

Walking hand in hand
The dawn discloses
We were dreaming of a land
Where love reposes
But castles made of sand
Like winter roses
Are fated to die
My darling, like you and I
My darling...

Where are those sweet Septembers
The joy my heart remembers?
Lost in the shadows of the past
The rainbow arched above you
The sacred words, I love you
Why did that dream go by so fast?

Was it too beautiful
Was it too beautiful to last?
