Life is so strange
When you don't know
How can you tell
Where you're going to
You can't be sure
Of any situation
Something can change
Then you won't know

You ask yourself
Where do we go from here
This seems so altered here
Just as far beyond as I can see
I still don't know what this all means to me

I have nowhere to go
I don't know what to do
And I don't even know the time of day
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something can change
It's unknown
Then you won't know
Destination unknown

Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something can change
It's unknown
Then you won't know
Destination unknown

When will my time come
Has it all been said and done
I know I'll leave when it's my time to go
Till then I carry on with what I know

Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something can change
It's unknown
Then you won't know
Destination unknown

Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something can change
It's unknown
Then you won't know
Destination unknown

Life is so strange
