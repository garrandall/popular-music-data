Life is so strange when you don't know
How can you tell where you're going to
You can't be sure of any situation
Something could change and then you won't know

You ask yourself
Where do we go from here
It seems so all too near
Just as far beyond as I can see
I still don't know what this all means to me

So you tell yourself
I have nowhere to go
I don't know what to do
And I don't even know the time of day
I guess it doesn't matter anyway


Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
And Something could change
It's unknown
And then you won't know
Destination unknown



You ask yourself
When will my time come
Has it all been said and done
I know I'll leave when it's my time to go
'Til then I'll carry on with what I know



Life is so strange
Life is so strange...
