Purvis-Elliott

Dirty old hole in the side of the road for the man who cleans the streets
Open pub doors where the working class goes at night
Written on walls where the cats never crawl for the glass along the top
Man, I was born there, I'm gonna walk right back

CHORUS:
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I wish I'd never made up my mind to stray

Nobody owns all the dirty old clothes that are lying in the lane
Whistling loud, the four-thirty shift has gone
Little old man with a pole in his hand lighting lamps along the way
Hurry me back there, I wish I'd never gone

Repeat CHORUS 3 times

Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home...
