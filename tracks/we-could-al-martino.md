If anyone could find the joy
That true brings a girl and boy
We could, (we could)
We could, you and I

If anyone could ever say
That their true love
Was here to stay
We could, (we could)
We could, you and I

When you're in my arms, I know
You're happy to be there
And just as long as I'm with you
I'm happy anywhere

If anyone could pray each night
To thank the Lord cause all is right
We could, (we could)
We could, you and I

When you're in my arms, I know
You're happy to be there
And just as long as I'm with you
I'm happy anywhere

If anyone could pray each night
To thank the Lord cause all is right
We could, (we could)
We could, you and I
