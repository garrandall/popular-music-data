Cry softly when he
Leaves you, lonely girl
Don't let him know you're blue
Someday, true love
Will come to you

Cry softly, this is not
The end of the world
Somwhere, a heart beats true
That heart will bring
True love to you

New lips will kiss
Those lonely tears away
And whisper words
You never heard yesterday

Cry softly, and
Forget him, lonely girl
Don't let him know you're blue
And then true love
Will come to you

And once again
You'll give your heart away
Without the fear that you
Might hear someone say

Cry softly when he
Leaves you, lonely girl
Don't let him know you're blue
Someday, true love
Will come to you

Someday, true love
Will come to you
Someday, true love
Will come to you
