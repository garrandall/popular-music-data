Saw you dancing last night with someone
Wish it were me, wish it were me
Dancing with you, wish it were true

Saw you holding your arms around him
Wish it were me, wish it were me
Clinging to you, wish it were true

Don't say it's hopeless
Won't you learn to tell
How I'd like to touch you
With my prayer

Yes, I pray that my prayers
Will touch you, touch you for true
So you'd love me too

And the whole world would see
Wish it were me
And the whole world would see
I wish it were me
