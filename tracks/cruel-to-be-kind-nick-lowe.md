Oh, I can't take another heartache
Though you say you're my friend
I'm at my wits' end
You say your love is bonafide
But that don't coincide
With the things that you do
And when I ask you to be nice, you say

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

Well, I did my best to understand you
But you still mystify
And I wanna know why
I pick myself up off the ground
To have you knock me back down
Again and again
And when I ask you to explain, you say

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

Well, I did my best to understand you
But you still mystify
And I wanna know why
I pick myself up off the ground
To have you knock me back down
Again and again
But when I ask you to explain, you say

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
You've gotta be cruel to be kind
Oh, you've gotta be cruel to be kind
Baby, you've gotta be cruel to be kind
You've gotta be cruel to be kind
You've gotta be cruel to be kind...
