Hey
I know a cat named Way-out Willie
Got a groovy little chick named rockin' Lily
She can walk and talk and Suzie-Q
And do that crazy hand-jive too
Hand jive
Hand jive
Hand jive
Doin' that crazy hand jive
Hey
Hey
Momma momma, look at uncle Joe
Doin' the hand jive with Sister Flo
Gramma gave baby sister a dime
Said "Do that hand jive one more time"
Hand jive
Hand jive
Hand jive
Doin' that crazy hand jive
Hey
Wha

Hey
Hey
Doctor, lawyer and an Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-out Willie give 'em all a treat
When he do that hand jive with his feet
Hand jive
Hand jive
Hand jive
Doin' that crazy hand jive
Hey
Whoah

Hey...
