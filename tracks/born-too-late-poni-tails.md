Born too late for you to notice me
To you, I'm just a kid that you won't date
Why was I born too late?

Born too late to have a chance to win your love
Oh why, oh why was it my fate
To be born too late?

I see you walk with another
I wish it could be me
I long to hold you and kiss you
But I know it never can be

For I was

Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too late?

Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too la-a-a-a-ate?
Why was I born too late?
Too late
