Well, way down yonder on Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from a wagon seat
I tune my fiddle and I rub my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose she clucked but she couldn't get loose
Said John to the goose, "If you don't be still
We'll miss our supper down in Candy ville"

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you

Now Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg
The wooden leg was nothing but a little wooden peg
With one shoe off and one shoe on
Do the double-shuffle till the cows come home

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you

I took 20 dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since
I sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you

Over the hickory and down the pine
The racoon left and the old hound whined
John said "Sick 'em", and the racoon left
They crossed Green River in a minute and a half

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you
