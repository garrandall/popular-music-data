There's a rainbow, yeah
In my heart
That reminds me
Of a-how we parted
An' I, I know that
My love is gone, forever
But deep down in my heart
I'll love her forever an ever, ha!

There's a rainbow
Oh-oh-oh, in my heart
Now, baby, baby, baby
C'mon now, baby
Now, listen to me

I'm down on my knees
Ooo-yeah, yeah-yeah
Please, listen to my plea
Ooo-yeah, oh-yeah, a-ay-yeah
I'm a-looking up above
Ooo-yes, up above
Prayed for your love, oh-yeah, ha!

Please, please stop this rainbow
Oh-whoa-oh, in my heart
Baby, baby, baby
C'mon now, baby
C'mon stop this rainbow

A-ha-ha, yeah!

A c'mon now baby
An' stop this rainbow
An' I know the things
I've done to you is wrong
I want ya to give me one mo' chance
Just-a one mo' chance
To prove to you
A-that I know I was wrong

An' I realize now, baby

An' I realize now, baby
That love only comes once
An' when it comes ya better grab it
'Cause it may not come no more

Unk lady: 'It won't even come 'round you, baby)

An' I'm askin' ya, baby

Bite! your neck

An' I just wanna ask you one thing, baby
An' I just wanna ask you one thing, baby
I just wanna ask you one thing
