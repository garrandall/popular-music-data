Just like music..
This is Marvin Gaye
I'd like to wish you all the uh, best
Uh love each other, peace be with you
Umm - I sure do hope you uh like this music
God bless you all


Peace to Keith Murray


Must be the MU-SIC, that got me in a zone
Step until your bones make you lose control
Take hold of your mind body and your soul
Soul.. (hahhh baby, wooooo - just like music)
As I do ya, who ya
Run right through ya, like I never knew ya, ooh
Stick to your ribs like grits
I get better with time with this shit (just like music)
Aww man, make you feel so good
I rain through your neighborhood, like a sunshower
Shine light in the darkest hour
Give the weakest man the most power (just like music)
So harmonious and sacred
Without this, I don't think the world would ever make it
When negativity come my way, that thing bang
How it sound Marvin? (Just like music)



Music baby, I don't worry bout a thing
Ahhhhh turn on your music, see my happiness beam
.. just like music


Yo, yo, yo dogg
How you doin? I bent my back Lex tire movin
on the hood streets, hood beats, drippin down jewelry
I'm outside where the crooks meet
But God don't give me shook feet (just like music)
Yeah, untrained untamed guerilla
I'm the one to blame when the earth start goin
(insaaaaaaaaaaaane, aww baby)
.. shake it, shake it shake it .. (woo, music)
Yo, I can't get in the club, so what?
I got a hot dame, bout to make the drawers
(fall like raaaaaaaaaaaain - all over yo' head)
(awww baby, music)
To my deputies, call me Boss Hog
When I smoke sticky, I'm able to walk walls
And I won't fall, only thing my car stalls
But I'm in the hood nigga (just like music)



Music baby, I don't worry bout a thing
Ahhhhh turn on your music, see my happiness beam


Ohhhwoahhhhhh, your love is music, oh my darling yes
Your love is music, awww baby yeahh, and music is my life
I've got my music, turn on some music
La-da-da-da-dah, dah-dah-dah, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!
La-da-da-da-dah, doo-doo-doooooo
Turn on some music, turn on some music
Da-da-da-da, doo-doo-doooo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo doo, la-la-dah
Turn on some music, I've got my music

Hey.. I love my music hey, you need the music

Awwwww-awwww-awwwww, awwwwwwwwwwwhh - just like music
Awwwwwwwww-awwwwwww

I've got my music hey, I love the music, ow
Turn on some music hey, get off the music, woo
Turn up the music ow, let's have the music, huh
Yeah
