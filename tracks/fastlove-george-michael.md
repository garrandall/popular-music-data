(Gotta get up to get down)
(Gotta get up to get down)
(Oh oh baby baby)

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Well baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

(Oh oh baby baby)
Oh, yeah yeah
(Oh oh baby baby)
What's there to think about baby?
(Oh oh baby baby)
Hey baby, oh yeah
(Oh oh baby baby)

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
But I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details baby
Gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind
Get yourself some lessons in love

So close
I can taste it now baby
So close

In the absence of security
Made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah
I miss my baby, tonight
So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW babe
Searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh you really oughta get up now
That's right
Oh you really oughta get up
(Oh oh baby baby)
Oh yeah
Looking for some affirmation
