Mass hysteria, this is techno
House is not my home but it rocks though
I checked up on the late great J.B
His death is said on national TV
How, when, and why these are the
Main things that I heard when I stroll down the lane
Of memory
Man are you with that
James Brown is dead

Total chaos, man it's resurrected
I'm confused that things are gettin' hectic
In my brain, what is happenin'
Could this be a big misunderstanding
It is
The hardest working man in show biz is alive so yo bust this
Don't be mislead 'cause the newsman said
James Brown is dead

James Brown is dead

James Brown is dead

Nightmare is over
Now I'm awoke
Grab the mike, rip shit and go for broke
The musical masterpiece release that these
Now I will get much respect from MCs
Arrive the way, cause I heard him say
This is fly, this cool type of guy
He's dope, and oh so bad
James Brown is dead

James Brown is dead

James Brown is dead
