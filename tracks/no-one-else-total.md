There you are, lookin' at me
Tell me, what you want this to be
It could be everything that your heart desires
All you got to do is stick around for awhile
There's so many things that I wanna do
Take you all around, it's all up to you
If you take my hand and just follow me
There's no telling what we could be
Just you and me


I don't need no one else but you
Tell me what you want me to do
I don't need no one else but you
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true


Could you be all that I need
Show me what I need to see
If it's alright with you, tell me now baby
We can take this all the way just tell me how
There's so many things that I wanna do
Take you all around, it's all up to you
Dare you take my hand, and just follow me
There's no telling what we can be, just you and me


I don't need no one else but you
Tell me what you want me to do
I don't need no one else but you
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true


If you wanna just take your time
I'll understand, just tell me why
If it's alright with you, I'll let you lead the way
No need to wait baby, don't hesitate


For what it's worth I'ma keep bustin', keep puffin', and loving nothin'
If I die I'ma be high, no tears all of a sudden bluffin'
Never finger on the lever selling records
In J. Boogie leather ready to wreck a nigga whenever
What I need is that scholar that could capitalize my dollar
Capital size when ya hit it make me wanna holler
I do run run my mouthpiece with a vengeance
Start repenting if you didn't in the beginning
You should hit your knees, and do whatever pleases you
Long as you pleasing me I'm all you need nigga
The decoy watch Brat kill and destroy
You the last one to fuck with So So Def and Bad Boy


I don't need no one else but you
Tell me what you want me to do
I don't need no one else but you
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true


I don't need no one baby, as long as I have you
You gotta believe me baby, 'cos what I say is true
I don't need no one baby, you're the only one for me
I don't need nobody else, baby can't you see?
