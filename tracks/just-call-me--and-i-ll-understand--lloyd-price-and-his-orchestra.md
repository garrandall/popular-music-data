Here I stand, before you
With my heart in my hand
With love and devotion
I'm at your command

Folks say you love another
But don't explain
If you need me, just call me
And I'll understand

Could love you, my darling
It's oh, so fine
Every hour and each day
You're on my mind

They say you love another
But don't be ashamed
If you need me, just call me
And I'll understand

Oh-oh, all know, in every game
Somebody's gotta lose each hand
I loved you, and lost you
So don't explain

But there's one thing, my darling
I ask of you
Just love your new lover
As I loved you

'Cause here in my heart
You'll always remain
If you need me, just call me
And I'll understand

I know, I know
I'll understand
Woah, woah, woah
I'll understand
Mmm, mmm, mmm
