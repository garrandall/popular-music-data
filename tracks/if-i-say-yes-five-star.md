The way you look at me, you blow your secrecy
I know what you've got on your mind
You know I want it too, so hard to keep my cool
But it's my heart that's on the line

Cupid is shooting his arrows
I'm standing in the line of fire
Should I follow you into the shadows
And surrender to this desire

(If I say yes) If I say yes, will you treat me right
Won't settle for less than the best of you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, tonight will be the night
If love is the question, the answer is yes

(If I say yes) If I say yes, I'm positively yours
I'm willin' to bet all I got on you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, 100% sure
If love is the question, the answer is yes

Well, I don't know
I gotta think about it

My curiosity is playing tricks on me
Defenses are wearing down
When I look in your eyes, it gets me so high
I can't keep my feet on the ground, no

Now that we're down to the wire
This is the moment of truth
Emotions are wrapped up in fire
And tonight we're gonna turn them loose

(If I say yes) If I say yes, will you treat me right
Won't settle for less than the best of you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, tonight will be the night
If love is the question, the answer is yes

(If I say yes) If I say yes, I'm positively yours
I'm willin' to bet all I got on you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, 100% sure
If love is the question, the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Cupid is shooting his arrows
I'm standing in the line of fire
Should I follow you into the shadows
And surrender to this desire

(If I say yes) If I say yes, will you treat me right
Won't settle for less than the best of you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, tonight will be the night
If love is the question, the answer is

(If I say yes) If I say yes, I'm positively yours
I'm willin' to bet all I got on you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, 100% sure
If love is the question, the answer is

(If I say yes) If I say yes, will you treat me right
Won't settle for less than the best of you
(If I say yes) If I say yes, tonight will be the night
If love is the question, the answer is yes

(If I say yes) If I say yes, I'm positively yours
