Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry


Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always


Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all


And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more


Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know

When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together


Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart (You'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there)
Always


Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always

Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there
Always
