Oh, darling
Darling, you're so fine
Oh, darling

Girl, if words could say
Darling, I'd find a way
To let you know what you mean to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

Oh, oh, oh, darling
I dream about you often my pretty girl, yeah
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh huh

You were living like half a man
Then you couldn't love but now you can
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad
More soul than I've ever had
I'm gonna love you every single night
Yes, I will
Cause I think you're so dog gone out of sight

Whoa, oh, darling
I dream about you often my pretty boy, yeah
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh huh
Whoa, oh, oh
Every night, oh, darling
I'm gonna love you every single night
Yes, I will
Cause I think that you're too dog gone outta sight
Oh, oh, darling
I dream about you often my pretty darling
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Darling, pretty darling
My darling, you're so fine
Oh, oh, oh
Darling, I think that you're fine
My little darling
Thank god you're mine
Oh, oh, oh
Darling
I'm gonna love you every single night
Oh, darling
You know I think that you're so dog gone outta sight
Whoa, oh
I think that you're fine
My little darling
Thank god you're mine
Oh, oh, oh
