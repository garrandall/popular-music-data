So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat

Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind
And your arms have get me safe from the rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place to harbor you and me

Your love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo filled with love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat

Up till now we sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Don't let this trip you have flow away from me
Don't let me drift away, my dear, when love can set me free

Your love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo filled with love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat

Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat
