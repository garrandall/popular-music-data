Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?


I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song


This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?


So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same


This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free


American life (American life)
I live the American dream (American dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)


I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more


This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?


Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?


American life (American life)
I live the American dream (American dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)
American life


I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it


Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?


A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it


I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shot-e
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems


Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American dream)
Do I have to change my name?
(American life)
(I live the American dream)
(American life)
(I live the American dream)
(American life)
(I live the American dream)
(American life)
(I live the American dream)
