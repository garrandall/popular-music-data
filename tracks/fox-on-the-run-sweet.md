I - don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
Okay - you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before


Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away


You - you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand (second hand)
I've heard it all before
I - don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before


Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away


F-foxy
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
(Fox)
