Red and blue and shades of gray
That's the dress you wore today
As you pass me by
Red and blue makes gray

Baby, a diamond ring and everything
That we had always planned
Now he takes your hand
Red and blue makes gray

(CHORUS)
Red and blue means me and you
Must have to say goodbye
But given time, I think you're fine
That red and blue means
Lonelieness for you

A diamond ring, baby, everything
Oh, that we had always planned
But now he takes your hand
Red and blue makes gray

(CHORUS)
Red and blue, oh, shades o gray
I remember that's
The dress you wore today
As you passed me by
Oh, red and blue makes gray

Red and blue makes gray
Red and blue makes gray
