gotta stack ya paper
chop em' like a razor!
if you gon'grind or if
you gonna pull papers!yeah


I'm a southside playa that love to wreck
I got 25-G's above my neck
when I'm at the Cashattia I love to bet
should I take the Corvette or the bubble lex?
I put diamonds in yo faces on a daily basis
I done wrecked T-town and club Oasis
I got three Jags in my parking spaces
'95 Air Max with blue laces
you can call me a pimp like Dolomite
I charge five G's to hold a mic
if it aint no drank I dont hold a Sprite
after I do this I got mo' to write
I'm a stay Sucka Free thats my family
me,Redd,Hump,Fuzz,and Anthony
nigga we livin ya'll fantasy
and I take baths with vanity
I'm in the studio from 9 to 5
I'm a stay indepedent I aint gon' sign with Jive
I'm eatin fettucini ya'll eatin fries
like R.Kelly I wish I could fly
I'm a 18 year old C-E-O
my favorite movie is CB4
when you lookin at my watch see me snow
and if you want pimps here we go
you aint know Lil'Flip is the freestyle king
I got platinum on my bezzeltyne
stretch my money like a limousine
ya gal hooked on me like nicotine
when I pull up to the show I'm in 16 cars
16 ice,and 16 stars
yeah I'm spittin game to like 16 broads
I think I just wrecked these 16 bars


maan!that boy a fool
godamn!but


gotta stack ya paper
chop em' like a razor!
if you gon'grind or if
you gonna pull papers!yeah


ay I'm in a Escalade eatin Etoufee
like Lil'Troy its a better way
I ride on red and sit on gray
me and Ron C blow on hay
I'm playa made on razorblades
all my clothes are tailor-made
I pour a 4 in Gatorade
watch me lean in the shade
I keep a fade I'm wearin J's
I pull more stunts than Super Dave
the reason I ball like a ball
cause thats just for you to hate
I'm underated but anticipated money in my face
I gotta make it jump on a mic I gotta break it
A million dollars I gotta take it
I'm the millionare I'm a billionare
Check the Billboard I'm still in there
I put diamonds all in yo face so you know
Lil'Flip dont really care I play truth
or dare with yellow bones talk on prime co telophones 
got hoes from Hiram Clark all the way to Yellowstone
and I ride on chrome thats all I do
Slow down music we call it Screw
Everyday watch out for the boys in blue
I wear Fubu and Dada too
I'm Lil'Flip I'm Sucka Free
Ten thousand aint enough for me
Cant none of ya'll niggas fuck with me
I cant get enough of this luxury but
I'm a billionare and I'm playa made on razorblades
Lookin good chunkin up the duece
Cloverland is my hood nigga ugh!




ay they call me Lil'Flip I love to wreck
you wanna do a song I need a check
collect my hoes like upper deck 
southside niggas get much respect
nigga Ron C put me on the track
my nigga named Hump put me on the map
my nigga named Johnny man he gave me plat
a nigga out of line nigga he get slapped
a million dollar nigga with a million dollar mouth
a million dollar vase with a million dollar coach
southside nigga thats what I'm about
if a nigga owe me money I'm a call him out
I'm a let a nigga know I'm the freestyle king
these niggas dont wanna step in the freestyle ring
nigga this shit is freestyling
nigga I'm the mothafuckin freestyle king
I said it one I said it twice
gotta whole closet full of Nikes
went to Worthings full of dice
you know Lil'Flip gotta lot of ice
I gotta lot of mics cause I'm in The Source
me and Brian playin on the golf course
nigga got a brand new Rolls Royce
hoes give me head they got no choice
I'm a million dollar nigga thats what
I do slow down music by Watts and Screw
everyday watch out for the boys in blue
nigga I use to watch shots of Fubu
million dollar nigga with DVDs,Escalades,
drop top,and GMC's before I listened
to DJ Screw I use to jam DJ Dmd Lil'Flip
is the only star down south we just
sip the bar 20 inches rip the car I gotta
be real I'm a rep the toy I'm a stay
the king I'm a stay the prince I'm a get
the house with the big ol' fence and when
I write my rhymes I dont get lyric bent nigga
