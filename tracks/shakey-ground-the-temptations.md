Uuummmm.... uummm...

Lady luck and a four leaf clover
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
'Til you leave in depth the situation

Yeah...
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Lord better throw me a life preserver
'Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears

Ooohh...
Standing on shakey ground
Yeah... ever since you put me down
And I'm standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Standing on shakey ground
Huh... ever since you put me down
I'm standing on shakey ground... yeah
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Shake... shake... shake... shake...
Standing on shakey ground... yeah
Ever since you put me down
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Shake... shake... shake... shake... shake...
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Standing on shakey ground... yeah
Ever since you put me down
Shake... shake... shake... shake...
Standing on shakey ground
Yeah... yea... yeeeaaa...

Yeeaah...
Standin'... standin'... standin'... standin'... standin'...
On shakey ground
Standin' on shakey ground
Everything jump up 'n down
Wow
