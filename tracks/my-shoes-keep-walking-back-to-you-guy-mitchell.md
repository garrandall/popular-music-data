Oh, my arms keep reachin' for you
My eyes keep searchin' for you
My lips keep callin' for you
And my shoes keep walkin' back to you

Now, I may say that I don't care
Hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
Ah, but when the day is through
My heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

And my arms keep reachin' for you
My eyes keep searchin' for you
My lips keep callin' for you
And my shoes keep walkin' back to you
(And my shoes keep walkin' back to you)

Well, no matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
'Cause nothin' else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die
The day you said good bye
And I can't forget no matter what I do

And my arms keep reachin' for you
My eyes keep searchin' for you
My lips keep callin' for you
And my shoes keep walkin' back to you
And my shoes keep walkin' back to you
