Letra de "Barbara Mason - A good man is gone (1975) - David Porter - I'm Afraid the Masquerade is Over (1971) - Betty Lavette - Let me down easy (1965/1969) - Bobby Byrd - I'm not to blame (1970) - The Persuaders - Thin line between love and hate (1971)"







Let me down easy though your love for me is gone
Let me down easy since you feel to stay is wrong
I know it's all over but the last goodbye
Let me down easy

When you pass by me, say hello once in a while
When you pass by me, baby, does it hurt so much to smile?
We promised that we'd still be friends till the very end
I'm begging you, baby, please, let me down easy


You don’t know what your doing to me, baby
I can't keep living in this world all by myself
Your leaving make my whole world a shamble
Oh, baby, oh i just can't stand it
You, you left me, you left me but I'm not to blame
Oh, no

I'm not trying to be no big thing, lord, no
I'm not trying to give you no advice
I don’t claim to be no philosopher
But i sure know this is'nt right baby, baby
We should be as one and never, never, never apart
The thought of me losing you to someone else it breaks my...


It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line, between love and hate

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in, I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says, who is it?
She opens up the door and lets me in
Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?
Are you hungry, honey? Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat
And the woman tells me, pass me your hat too
All the time she smiles, never once raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning



The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way, you keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That really really hurt you one day
