Once I walked beside you, so in love were we then
It had always been that way since we were children
Then one day she saw you, lied and flirted for you
Helplessly I watched her take your love away

While she's not with you she cheats and she enjoys to
How can I sit by and cry while she destroys you?
Though you may not want me, my heart keeps repeating
Onward, onward, time to stop retreating

Attack! Attack!
Save the love we thought would live forever
Attack! Attack!
She wants me to run but I shall never
For all is fair in love and war
Your tender love I'll fight her for

Once I gave to you my love and sweet surrender
But when you are in her arms you can't remember
What am I to do? You say to me you love her
But for me no other boy compares to you

All the dreams we shared, are they to end in sorrow?
Shall I tell my heart there's no hope for tomorrow?
Like a drum that's beating, my heart keeps repeating
Onward, onward, time to stop retreating

Attack! Attack!
Save the love we thought would live forever
Attack! Attack!
She wants me to run but I shall never
For all is fair in love and war
Your tender love I'll fight her for

Night shall find me praying, God shall find me weeping
'Till your loving heart again is in my keeping
No, she can not have you, not while my heart's beating
Onward, onward, time to stop retreating

Attack! Attack!
Save the love we thought would live forever
Attack! Attack!
She wants me to run but I shall never
For all is fair in love and war
Your tender love I'll fight her for

(Repeat to fade)
