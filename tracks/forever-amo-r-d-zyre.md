Hey girl, don't let this love just slip away
The feelings that I feel for you
Will always stay this way
(Stay this way)
You turn my world around
And baby love is what you find
Knowing you and I will hold the hands of time

My heart will blow in ecstasy for something
That is true
(Something that it's true)
I will turn you back away
I look steady into your eyes
And let you know how much I love youu
This love will never die

Forever amor

How much I love you in every special way
And I wanna tell you, girl
How much you mean to me more than anyway)

This love is right for me
Boy, can you see it in my eyes
You cautivated me with joy

In night times
My heart belong to you
And only you will hold the key
The key to a paradise
And forever you and me

The things will talk

And baby, you will know
This special love I feel for you
Will never let you go
(Never let you go)

The distance never 
Don't worry
Must to live with out
Together we must fly away
Where lovers can't be found

You know
That our love was meant to be
A special bond between us, girl
Two hearts in harmony

I climb the highest mountain
Just to wish upon a star
To keep you here right by my side
No matter where youu are

Oooh

Has made me realize
That you're the only one for me
Keeps me so alive

Always forever I'll be true
