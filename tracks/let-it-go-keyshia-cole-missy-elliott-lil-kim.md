You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at its where he
Where he wanna be

(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh)


(I don't want yo man)
Cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like that
(Eh he he he he)
Yo man he be calling me back
Cause see I'm fine and a matter of fact
(Eh he he he he)
He asked how I do that dat
Fit my jeans over baby fat
Listen
I don't know the type of tricks he playing
But I should warn you I don't want ya man


I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinking about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me


But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be


If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go


When this song come on in the club
They gonna be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gonna drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They gonna mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me and Keyshia won't stop
Till the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot


Now understand why I take my time
Cause you come wit alibis
Tryna get me to see thats where you tryna be
But I don't want yo man
Yo mans been calling me
Tryna get me to see
That he wants me to be wit him
But he ain't the one for me
And if you only knew
You would
Do what you had to
Finally see that, finally get the chance to see that


You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at its where he
Where he wanna be


If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go


Here's a little lesson Lil Kim don't stress em
Kick em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke up wit my Ex he wit her for now but
Little do she know she just a rebound
Calling my phone she so outta pocket
I been there before o'girl you need to stop it
Tricking on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture
My pictures in his wallet
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam now he wanna come home
But I
Don't trust him
Though I still love him
No longer want him
Looking at his cousin
Kinda buzzing
Loose off the goose
Got him on a chase like cranberry juice
When he's wit you he's wishing it was me
You might be where he's at but I'm where
He wanna be (Baby Baby!)

Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go


If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
And if he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go


When this song come on in the club
They gonna be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gonna drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They gonna mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me Kim and Keyshia don't stop
Till the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot
