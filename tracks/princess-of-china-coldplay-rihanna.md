Oh


Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go!

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh, oh!

Oh


Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on, and on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw water on my flame?

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
You stole my star
La, la la la la laaaaaa

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me
