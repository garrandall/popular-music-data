You know, I know it's gonna be good girl
I can feel your water streaming down all around
Here's my love, am I qualified in your eyes?
I can feel myself deeper, deeper inside (pushin' in yo body)
Oh... Lay you by my side I'll let you light my fire
I can see it in your eyes

Sho' feels damn good to me
When I'm pushin' inside of you (pushin' inside you)
Can't explain the way it feels
All I wanna do is be with you (all I wanna do is be with you)

Okay, enough of that foreplay
Somethings telling me that
Your body's soaking wet
So, here's my love, am I qualified in your eyes?
I can feel myself deeper, deeper inside (pushin' in your body)
Oh... lay you by my side
I'll let you light my fire
I can see it in your eyes

Um... It's gonna be good girl
Let's go all night, all night
La da da, la da da, la da da, la
