Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
What cha tryin' to do
With ya dancin' shoes
Messin' up my mind
(Reachin') all the time
Don't you ever (baby)
Get tired of me

Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
Hey (now) with your wavy hair
Baby don't you dare
When everybody stares
Start to get jealous
 of the fellas
Lookin' at you the way they do

Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
We been dancin' (sellin')
Can't keep it up there we're gotta stop
All I wanna do is make love to you
But all you wanna do is Boo-ga-loo
Ar hey hey

Git, git,git, ar get nasty hey

Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
What cha gonna do
Tell us it's up to you
Tired of waitin', losin' my patience
Dance is all you think of
Don'y cha know that I
Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
We're been dancin'
Can't keep it up there we're gotta stop
All I wanna do is make love to you
But all you wanna do is Boo-ga-loo
Hey you little Boo-ga-loo
What cha tryin' to do...
