Somebody called for the queen?
Thugger...


I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink on pneumonia
The racks keep me up only Foldgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

You gotta picture me rollin'
Pacific ice, I'm an ocean (ocean)
Ready for war like I'm Russia (Russia)
Lady Chanel for the luggage (luggage)
My diamonds they tusslin' (they tusslin')
My neck and my belly on 'Tussin ('tuss)
They callin' for me and they rushin' (rushin')
You wanna be like me and I love it (yeah)
Hundred racks on her draws (yeah)
Big racks, better calm down (yeah)
If you're gon' ride, come around (yeah)
Whole squad smokin' out the pound (yeah)
Squad goals on these hoes (yeah)
Maison Margiella my toes (yeah)
Farrakhan glasses for the chosen (yeah)
You can gon' get mad (gon' get mad)

Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint, and who's you? (Who's you?)
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch, I wanna fuck you too (fuck you too)
Drippin' my swag, ooh, pop tag, I'm..mhm..
I got a Smith and in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general true (hey)

I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink on pneumonia
The racks keep me up only Foldgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'


You gotta picture me rollin', packin' a semi no colon
Ready for war like Korea, headliner shows out in Poland
You should be cleanin' my mansion, my past is disgustin'
Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Latex on my draws, bitch, go clean my crown
Can't hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent' and I switched to the Ghost like "Who's you?"
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New


I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink on pneumonia
The racks keep me up only Foldgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint, and who's you?
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch, I wanna fuck you too
Drippin' my swag, ooh, pop tag, I'm..mhm..

I get all type of cash, I'm a general true
