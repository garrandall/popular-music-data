Far away, I feel your beating heart
All alone, beneath the crystal stars
Staring into space, what a lonely face
I'll try to find my place with you

Chorus:
What a Beautiful smile
Can I stay for a while
On this beautiful night
We'll make everything right
My beautiful love
My beautiful love

Larger than the moon, my love for you
Worlds collide, as heaven pulls us through
The secret of the world is written in the stars
I'm carrying your heart in mine

What a Beautiful smile
Can I stay for a while
On this beautiful night
We'll make everything right
My beautiful love

Maybe a greater thing will happen
Maybe all will see
Maybe our love will catch like fire
As it burns through me

Maybe a greater thing will happen
Maybe all will see
Maybe our love will catch like fire
As it burns through me

Maybe a greater thing will happen
Maybe all will see
Maybe our love will catch like fire
As it burns through me

What a Beautiful smile
Can I stay for a while
On this beautiful night
We'll make everything all right

What a Beautiful smile
Can I stay for a while
On this beautiful night
We'll make everything all right

My beautiful love
La la la la love
La la la la love

My beautiful love
La la la la love
La la la la love

My Beautiful love
