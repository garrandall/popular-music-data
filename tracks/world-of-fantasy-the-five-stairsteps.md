Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy


It's a world where I'm never alone
It's a world of sheer make-believe
Where all young lovers have gone
To set their hearts


Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy


I go there whenever I feel the need
To make life have a new face
No-one intrudes upon my privacy
To me it's the most wonderful place


Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy


Here is where no problems lie
And lovers we all become
We live with love and never cry
'Cause in love the sum is one plus one

So come on love and follow me
To my world (To my world of fantasy)
Come my love (To my world of fantasy)
Come to my world of fantasy, mm mm yeah (To my world of fantasy)
Eee-ee
