Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Such a long time
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time
Such a long time
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time
Such a long time (Ooh)

Ooh, this shit bliss, I'm so rich (turned as shit, ooh)
Abs like Abercrombie Fitch (Damn, ooh)
Mille on my wrist
Versace boxers on my dick (On my dick, damn)
Bud Light running through my piss (Ooh)
On a yacht, fifty meters, insufficiâ (insufficient)
Fifty carats on my fist (On my fist)
The roof go down when I hit switch (Ooh, bitch)
I money-ball like Bradley Pitt (Bradley Pitt yeah)
I work so hard for all this shit (All this shit)
Pumping out classics, in the Batmobile going bat shit

Such a long time (damn)
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time
Such a long time

I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist (Wow)
I just bought my girl a new necklace (A new necklace)
1-2-3-4-5-6 (5-6)
I take 'em all, don't matter what the price is (What the price is)
I said I'm sorry mama for my vices (for my vices)
You'll never understand what my life is (what my life is)
1-2-3-4-5-6 (Damn)
Shit I'm checking off my bucket list (My bucket list)
You try to give advice, I don't need it
I've been doing what I want since fetus
What you call a holiday, I call another day
And I ain't ever stopping, no apologies

Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for a long time (For a long time)
Such a long time

I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist
