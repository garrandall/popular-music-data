Oh, yeah, yeah, hey


Such a long time (Wow)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Yeah)
Such a long time
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Yeah)
Such a long time (Oh)


Oh, this shit bliss, I'm so rich (Turnt as shit, oh)
Abs like Abercrombie Fitch (Damn, oh)
Mille, on my (Whoa, wrist, wrist)
Versace boxers on my dick (On my dick, damn)
Bud Light runnin' through my piss (Oh)
On a yacht, 50 meters, it's offish (It's official)
50 carats on my fist (On my fist)
The roof go down when I hit switch (Oh, bitch)
I money ball like Bradley Pitt (Bradley Pitt, ayy)
I worked so hard for all this shit (All this shit)
Pumpin' out classics (Oh)
In the Batmobile, goin' bat shit


Such a long time (Damn)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (For a long time)
Such a long time


I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist (Wow)
I just bought my girl a new necklace (A new necklace)
One, two, three, four, five, six (Five, six)
I'll take 'em all, don't matter what the price is (What the price is)
I said I'm sorry mama for my vices (For my vices)
You'll never understand what my life is (My life is)
One, two, three, four, five, six (Damn)
Shit, I'm checking off my bucket list (My bucket list)
You try to give advice, I don't need it
I've been doin' what I want since fetus
What you call a holiday (Oh), I call another day (Yeah)
And I ain't ever stoppin', no apologies


Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (A long time)
Such a long time


I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist
