Dawn is slowly breaking 
Our friends have all gone home 
You and I are waiting 
For Santa Clause to come 
There's a present by the tree 
Stockings on the wall 
And knowing you're in love with me 
Is the greatest gift of all 
The fire is slowly fading 
Chill is in the air 
All the gifts are waiting 
For children everywhere 
Throught the window I can see 
Snow begin to fall 
Knowing you're in love with me 
Is the greatest gift of all 

Just before I go to sleep 
I hear a church bell ring 
Merry Christmas everyone 
Is the song it sings 
So I say a silent prayer 
For creatures great and small 
Peace on Earth, good will to men 
Is the greatest gift of all 

Peace on Earth, good will to men 
Is the greatest gift of all
