Baby
You've been so good to me
And I love you
You set my soul at ease

Time had raised hurricanes
Ruinin' them pleasant dreams
You're the one who would come
Over and rescue me

You're beautiful
You've been so good to me
I need you
My mind needs to be free

Shake the wild, take the mile
Down with your tenderness
I'll be love, lifted up
I never felt like this

You lift me higher
You lift me higher
You lift me higher
Yeah, yeah

Sweetie
You've been so good to me
I want you
I want you to believe

Wear your hope like a coat
Don't let your heart go cold
Don't forget, you're the best man
That I've never known

You lift me higher
You lift me higher
Oh, you lift me higher
Yeah, yeah

Alright
You've been so good to me

You lift me higher
And you get me higher
And you lift me higher
Oh, my baby, higher
Yeah, yeah
