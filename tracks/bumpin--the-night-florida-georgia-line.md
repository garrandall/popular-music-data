The week was long
But now it's gone,
The drink is on
So fill your cup
And turn the good time music up

Pick up that sweet somebody wrap your arms around this Friday night
And get a little lost in the party
Float your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark
For a place to park
And two headlights
Find an old school A and B
And put a little shine on the vinyl seat, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

The night is young
The night is free
And so are we
So let it out and let me step inside your dream
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star light on the window dripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can't you see it now?

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark
For a place to park
And two headlights
Find an old school A and B
And put a little shine on the vinyl seat, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark
For a place to park
And two headlights
Two shots of Patron,
Don't wanna go home
2 AM in the morning
Just you and I
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just bumpin' the night

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
