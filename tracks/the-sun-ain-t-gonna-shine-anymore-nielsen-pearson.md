Loneliness is a coat you wear
The dark shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without her

Happiness is a place you're in
With nothing to lose and nothing to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Your tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without her

Lonely, without you babe
So lonely, I can't go on
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without her, without her

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without her

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without her
