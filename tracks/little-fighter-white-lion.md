Are you cryin tonight?
Are you feelin all right?
I told the world that you were down on your luck

You were one of a kind
One who'd never give in
Even when they put a price on your head

Has anyone heard the tales you tell
Or seen the scars you wear
Did anyone speak up when you fell
Does anybody care

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter
And don't let 'em end the things you do

And you were one with a cause
And a reason to be
You were a fighter for peace on this earth

And you were never afraid
You put your life on the line
And you were always alone out on the sea

Without a weapon in your hand
You came to fight a war
They took your life but didn't know
That you would never die

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter
And don't 'em end things you do

Are you feelin alright?
Cause I care, care

Run along little fighter
Oh cause I was there beside you
Never stop believing, so rise
Rise
RISE!

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter
And don't 'em end things you do

Rise again little fighter (Don't stop believing)
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter (And keep on moving)
And don't 'em end things you do

Yeah, don't let 'em ever end the things you do
