Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again

Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

Come on little lady, give us a smile
No, I ain't got nothing to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I've waited a while for
A moment to say "I don't owe you a Goddamn thing"

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

No sweet dream but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Letting a man tell me what I should do in my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice, or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

Come on little lady, give us a smile
No, I ain't got nothing to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I've waited a while for
A moment to say "I don't owe you a Goddamn thing"

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare than die unaware, yes
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream but I'm a hell of a night
