Talk to me, baby.
I'm listening.

Lay down.
And tell me what's on your mind.
What exactly did he do? To make you cry this time?
Well, I will be your comforter. I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light
Come in...

I see he's hurt you again,
When you're in pain I'm in pain
That's part of bein' a friend.
But this is a special case.
I held my feelings back because of him
And now I can see more than ever
I made a big, big, big mistake.

I don't mean to disregard your feelings
But I think that he's a fool.
he don't know how sensitive you are
And baby, that just ain't cool.

I'm just glad I could be here for you
When you need a helping hand.
But deep inside my heart, from the start
I know I shoud have been your man.

Lay down.
And tell me what's on your mind.
What exactly did he do?Tell me what he do...
To make you cry this time? To make you cry this time?
Well, I will be your comforter. I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light

I will comfort comfort comfort you.
I will I will comfort you.
I will comfort comfort comfort you.
I will I will comfort you.
I will comfort comfort comfort you.
I will I will comfort you.
I will comfort comfort comfort you.
I will I will comfort you.

Lay down. Please tell me, baby.
And tell me what's on your mind Tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do? To make you cry this time
Well, I'll be your comforter. I will make it alright
He cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light
