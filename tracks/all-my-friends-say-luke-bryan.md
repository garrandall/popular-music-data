I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard,
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you

Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard,
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard,
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
