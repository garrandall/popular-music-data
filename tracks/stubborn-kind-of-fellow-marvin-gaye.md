Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I try to put my arms around you
All because I wanna hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah



I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)
I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)

With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you


Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
