I didn't hear what you were saying.
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me.
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe?

If you needed love
Well, then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What is coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
You care about me?
I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't think so.

Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

If you needed love
Well, then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
You care about me?
I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad

I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

Whoa, oh, oh

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
You care about me?
I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
And he won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
You care about me?
I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
And he won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here.
I don't feel so bad

I don't feel so bad (Wake up call.)
I don't feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed.)
I don't feel so bad (Don't you care about me anymore?.)
(You care about me?)
I don't feel so bad.

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
