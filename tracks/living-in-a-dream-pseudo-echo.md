Walking in a strange light, looking at the walls
The walls are getting higher and I think they're gonna fall
They're gonna fall down over me, crush me till I scream
Now I'm only hoping that I'm living in a dream
It's just a dream;it's just a dream;

Fear lies over me, I feel it all around
Something's looking at me and I think it's got a crown
It's not a king or a queen but something in between
Now I'm only hoping that I'm living in a dream
It's just a dream;it's just a dream;

It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream

Wars and violence here happen every day
But I'm in another world a million miles away
It's just like real life, true life, living in a dream
But everything is better then, or that's the way it seems
It's just a dream;it's just a dream;

It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream

It's just a dream

It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
It's strange how things seem to be different
When you're living in a dream
Living in a dream living in a dream living in a dream
