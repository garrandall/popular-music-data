On a search, on a quest
For the one, for the best
Heavy days, heavy nights
I got you in my sight
I want you, you want me
To love you forever
Hold it together
And I want you to know that

Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good to me)
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good)

You defy, you possess
Wounded hearts of the best
But if I surrender to your demands
Would it change circumstance?

I want you, you want me
To love you forever
Hold it together
And I want you to know
It's you for me, me for you
Forever and ever
Ah, any weather
And I want you to know that

Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good to me)
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good)

Anything your heart desires
I will provide to you gladly
(Anything you want)
All you ever need and all you ever want
Is everlasting
(Just because your sure lookin' good)

Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good to me)
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
(Sure lookin' good)
