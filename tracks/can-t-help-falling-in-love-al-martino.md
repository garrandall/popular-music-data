Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

For I can't help
Falling in love with you

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

For I can't help
Falling in love with you
