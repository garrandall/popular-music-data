Ah yeah that's right
All you single people out there
This is for you

I'm not waitin' around for a man to save me
'Cause I'm happy where I am
Don't depend on a guy to validate me
No no
I don't need to be anyone's baby
Is that so hard to understand?
No I don't need another half to make me
Whole

Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be

That's right

Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good
I like who I am
I'm not saying I don't wanna fall in love 'cause I would
I'm not gonna get hooked up just 'cause you say I should
Can't romance on demand
I'm gonna wait so I'm sorry if you misunderstood

That's right

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single

Everything in its right time
Everything in its right place
I know I'll settle down one day
But 'til then I like it this way
It's my way
I like it this way

Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't

'Til then I'm single

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm tradin' places
Right now a star's in the ascendant

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)

I'm single
(Right now)
That's how I wanna be
(Right now)
I'm single
That's how I wanna be
