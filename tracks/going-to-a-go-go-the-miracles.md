Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere, and if you drop in there, you might see anyone in
Town

Goin' to a go go
Everybody's goin' to a go go
Well come on now
Don't you want to go - Yeah
One more time yeah, I'm
Goin' to a go go. Ooh ooh wee now
Goin' to a go go. Baby come on now

It doesn't matter where you are, a go go can be found
You'll see the people from your block and don't be shocked if you see your
Favorite star

Goin' to a go go
'Cause everybody's

Now it's alright. Oh, yeah
Goin' to a go go. Yes I am now
Goin' to a go go. Oh come on now

It doesn't matter if you don't stagger. It doesn't matter if you don't drag
You should have some fun, I'm telling everyone most every taxi that you flag
Is...

Goin' to a go go. Come on now
Don't you want to go. Yeah!
A one more time, yeah
