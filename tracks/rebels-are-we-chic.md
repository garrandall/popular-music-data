We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we

Life's a switch, don't let it play a trick on you
Try not to be fooled, be wise
Don't throw a fit, stay calm and you'll be cool
You'll find a solution right before your eyes

I know much more now that I'm older
Just a little bolder, listen to me
We can't give up, now that we're movin'
The whole world's groovin', we must stay free

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we

Don't cage us in, we might just surprise you
In order to convince you, we will
Oh, no, you can't take away our freedom
And get this straight, for that we won't be still

The time is now and if we have to fight
Come on let's unite, we got to do it soon
We're gonna win, on that you can depend
'Cause if you don't, me and my baby are goin' to the moon

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free

My baby and me
Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

Rebels
Rebels

Rebels, baby
Rebels
Rebels, baby
Rebels

Rebels, baby
Rebels
Rebels, baby
Rebels

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
