If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how true love can really be
I would use the brightest colours
To create a vision of harmony

It would be a reality
Cause it's only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you
Right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love, what do you see
Is it warm, is it tender when you think of me
I see the colour of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting of a love forever true

The colours of the rainbow
Turn grey whenever you're so far away
It changes like the seasons
You're the reason it happens that way

What you see are colours of emotion
Reflecting what I feel deep inside
Now I'd like to take a look
At emotions that you hide

Tell me what is the colour of love, what do you see
Is it warm, is it tender when you think of me
I see the colour of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting of a love forever true

And oh, though many may try to keep us apart
Oh the colours that I see in you
Will shine a light to see us through
No matter what the world will do, I'll always love you

Tell me what is the colour of love, what do you see
Is it warm, is it tender when you think of me
I see the colour of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting of a love forever true

What is the colour of love, oh tell me, tell me
Oh I wanna know, I wanna know
I see the colour of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect paining of a love forever true
