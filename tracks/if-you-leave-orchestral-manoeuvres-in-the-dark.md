If you leave, don't leave now
Please don't take my heart away
Promise me, just one more night
Then we'll go our separate ways
We've always had time on our side
Now it's fading fast
Every second, every moment
We've gotta make it last


I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd still be friends someday


If you leave I won't cry
I won't waste one single day
But if you leave don't look back
I'll be running the other way
Seven years went under the bridge
Like time was standing still
Heaven knows what happens now
You've gotta say you will


I'll touch you once, I'll touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd meet again


I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd still be friends


I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd meet again someday


If you leave
If you leave
If you leave
Don't look back
Don't look back
