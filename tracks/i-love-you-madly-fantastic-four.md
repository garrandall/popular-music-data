Hm-hm

There's just something about you
I simply adore
This is what keeps us together
And makes my love for you grow
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I found more joy in you, my darling
Than I could ever find in any other girl
And I wouldn't trade it, oh no
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby, baby, I love you madly)
'Cause I could never let you go
I love you madly

If you should ever choose another
It will shatter all of my dreams
But my love will still pour for you, darling
Pour like water from a flowing stream, oh, oh

If you should ever leave me
It will surely, surely, surely grieve me
And I wouldn't want to live
Without the love you give
'Cause I need you badly (Baby, baby, I need you badly)
I love you, love you (Baby, baby, I love you madly)
Love you, love you, love you madly

They say that loves comes and goes
Just like the morning sun
But I love you so much more, my darling
Than anybody could ever love anyone
Baby, baby, come closer (Closer)
Just a little bit closer (Closer)
And let me whisper in your ear (Whisper)

Darling, I love you today
More than I did yesterday
But not half as much
As I'll love you tomorrow
You've got everything, everything, everything
I've been searching for
And I'm so grateful, so very grateful that
I won't have to look no more

'Cause I found more joy in you, my darling
Than I have ever found in any other girl
And I wouldn't trade it, oh, no
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby, baby, I love you madly)
I love you, love you, love you (Baby, baby, I need you badly)
Love you, love you madly
And I need you, need you (Baby, baby, I love you madly)
Need you, need you so badly
