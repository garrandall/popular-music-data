The finest...

As life goes on
You learn to hold on
(You learn)
You learn to appreciate the finer things in life
(I appreciate)
The finest

(I have learned)


If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real


My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding (standing, standing)
Understanding how to hold onto you


After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I've ever known
(Finest I ever...)


If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else


Time flies when you're with me (with me, with me)
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Made up my mind and I'm positive (A better love)
A better love will never come my way


After all that we've been through
(Mmm, mmm...)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
(Mmm, mmm...)
Out of all the loves before
(Mmm, mmm...)
You're the finest I've ever known
(Finest I ever...)

After all that we've been through
(That we've been through)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I've ever known
(Finest I ever...)


Know (Know)
You keep me in love
(You keep me in love)
I'm lost (You're lost)
Just call me, I'll come
(Just call me and I'll come)
No other love before (No other love)
Could do what you do
(Could do what you do)
A little so much (Oh)
So much more from you (Much more)
No one else will do
(No one else will do)
There's no substitute
Your love's the finest love I've ever known
Ooh-ooh-ooh...


Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me

Oh...


After all that we've been through
(Ooh, that we've been through)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
(Change, no, no, no, no)
Out of all the loves before
(Hmm, the finest love)
You're the finest I'll ever know
(Uh-huh, finest I ever...)

After all that we've been through
(Ooh, that we've been through)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
(Out of all the loves I had before)
You're the finest I'll ever know
(Yes, you are, finest I ever)


Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
