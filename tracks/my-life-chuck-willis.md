You make my life worth living
I love the love you been giving
You make my whole life
A wonderful life to be living
You make the sun
Shine brighter
You make my darkness
So much lighter
You make my whole life
A wonderful life
To be living
I must have been
Out of my head
When I said I love someone else
Oh baby I wish I could live
One million years and love you all by myself
You make the wedding bells worth ringing
And you make here comes the bride worth singing
You make my whole life a wonderful life
To be living

Loving you baby
That's my desire
Come to be darling
Fill me with fire
You make my whole life
A wonderful life
To be living
