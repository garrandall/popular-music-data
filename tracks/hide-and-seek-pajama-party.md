Don't need a lover who's a mystery
I want somebody who can talk to me
Don't need someone just putting on a show
You started something
Baby don't let go

Don't make me wait too long for your reply
Don't make me wait too long
You ought to know that you don't have to hide
Tell me you're ready, boy
Look in my eyes

Baby, put your love on me
Just open up
Don't play hide and seek
Show me so that I can see
What's on your mind
Don't play hide and seek

Like when you want me
And you let me know
Like when you hold me
And you don't let go

Each time I see you
Walking through my door
I feel the passion growing more and more
Don't make me wait around for your reply
Don't make me wait around

Make up your mind boy
Don't you move too slow
Tell me you want my love
Come on
Let's go
Baby, put your love on me

When we touch I feel this strong attraction
You know I felt it from the start
And when we kiss
It starts a chain reaction
And it's burning it's way
Straight to my heart (heart, heart)

Baby, put your love on me
Just open up
Don't play hide and seek
Show me so that I can see
What's on your mind
Don't play hide and seek
