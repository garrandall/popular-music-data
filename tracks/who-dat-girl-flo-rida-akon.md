Hey, Ms Red Carpet
She can autograph my pockets,
Anytime, anyplace, anyway,
I'll be looking at everybody else,
Watch it,
I don't wanna de obnoxious,
But this girl worth the gossip,
Take away the smile,
The tattoos now, forever she very guardless
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
On and poppin'
She met Mark and then
Attitude like we arguing
Wit her by meh celebrate, glitter to my life
I should twitter this is girl, she's sparkling


She ain't no Rockstar
But she's got Groupies,
She ain't no Actress
But she makes Movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
She ain't got Riches
But she's got Fashion,
She ain't a Model
But camera's Flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl

Hey, they wanna know my mamma's name,
Cus that where she get from,
They ain't never shot her with silicon,
Shawty is her and her she's the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one,
I wish she would'a told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back,
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass,
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam,
Record some ssh,
On a playboy cam,
She ain't no actress
The movie found my matress
Rockstar, none of that practice
But she's got fanatics


She ain't no Rockstar
But she's got Groupies,
She ain't no Actress
But she makes Movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
She ain't got Riches
But she's got Fashion,
She ain't a Model
But camera's Flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl

Ooh ohh ohh
Look at her
Goo ooo ooo
I wanna know ooh ooh
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl



She ain't no Rockstar
But she's got Groupies,
She ain't no Actress
But she makes Movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
She ain't got Riches
But she's got Fashion,
She ain't a Model
But camera's Flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
