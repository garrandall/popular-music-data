Move Your Boogie Body You'll Feel Alright
Move Your Boogie Body Let's Dance All Night
Move Your Boogie Body You'll Feel Alright

We're Here To Let You Know If You Want To Boogie
Get Out On The Dance Floor, Let's Go, Let Go

We're Going To Have A Good Time, Mighty Fine Good Time
Cause We Are Funkin In Here
Get Off Till You Get Enough This Ain't No Time To Give Up
Cause When Your Bodies Hot Can't Stop, Can't Stop
Just Go Ahead And Strut Your Stuff
