Loca
Loca
Dance or die
Loca
Loca

She's playin' dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like ah!
Be careful amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love
But your love's only mine, boy

Sigo tranquila
Like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona
Like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it
So give him up

And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it


That girl is a naughta
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente
Got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' butt
But you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low, down low, down low
I can never get enough, oh, no, oh, no
She gives me the runaround
But I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love
With a crazy girl
But it's all good
And it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say
 "Aye, papi"

And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got one kiki

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got my kiki

Of course she doesn't know the things
That I'd do to please you
Take you to the medico por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
Cause we're dancin' Mambo
Oh, what she don't allow it?

I really can't help it
If I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna hit theâoh!

And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me
They're running out of in the market

And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Dios mÃ­o

That girl is loca
That girl is loca
That girl is loca
Pure madness

Loca
That girl is loca
That girl is loca

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she's got it all
I got my kiki

And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
La loca, la loca, la loca, loca
Loca, loca
