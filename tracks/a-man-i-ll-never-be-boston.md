What's up, Pauly?


Yeah, oh, I, don't, know
If I can make it through this
No other way around it
Just gotta keep it pushing
Oh, I, don't, know
There's something different 'bout it
Can't put my finger on it
Just know I wouldn't doubt it

When I see your top 10
You can find me like I'm Kyrie out in Boston
I'm back to win, don't beg your pardon
Had my wins, I had my losses
So don't say that I'm a novice, woa-hoah
Made an album in a day from a state so cold
Riding round, they know my name in every place we go
This is for the youngins and the old cats
New school still feeling like a throwback
We never lose, you should've known that
That we the dopest in New England, homie, it's not a secret
Looking at our numbers, you ain't seeing what I'm seeing
Wishing I would plummet and I haven't reached my peak yet
This what I dreamed on my swing set

Yeah, oh, I, don't, know
If I can make it through this
No other way around it
Just gotta keep it pushing
Oh, I, don't, know
There's something different 'bout it
Can't put my finger on it
Just know I wouldn't doubt it


24 hours time to slip and bring the hitters in
Came in different chariots, still made the track to kill the game
Illest village with the Mona Lisa, paint the image
Never fit the frame, Firefox, Mozilla
Throwing heaters every inning plain and simple
And it's only the beginning
Roll the credits in
Going through the motions and it's evident
Every day at war, I'm with some veterans
If you hating, get a friend
Piece of shit, you smelling what I'm stepping in
Hi, about to be sleeping, they made a couch of me
Momma call me son 'cause I'm bright and you in the house of me
Rising in every hour
We humans so let me shower the mentality that life is sweet
I'm courage, never cowardly, dog


Yeah, oh, I, don't, know
If I can make it through this
No other way around it
Just gotta keep it pushing
Oh, I, don't, know
There's something different 'bout it
Can't put my finger on it
Just know I wouldn't doubt it


Before I made Ivy, I was up all night
Someone get an IV since I was eleven, Boston Kyrie
In the basement by leans
Dank after the P, bro I call that my team
Someone get the visine, I crossed the pylon
My highlight reel, remember when I'm gone
I leave my mark like Sanchez didn't
You butt-fumbled the mic, I passed my time limit
Bro I'm still here
24 hours long, 10 songs been strong
Still I'll like Kim Jong, J Spin, oh (oh, oh)
Something different 'bout it, go and text your friends
You can't put your finger on it like electric fence
I don't know


Yeah, oh, I, don't, know
If I can make it through this
No other way around it
Just gotta keep it pushing
Oh, I, don't, know
There's something different 'bout it
Can't put my finger on it
Just know I wouldn't doubt it

We fuckin' did it man
We made a whole album in one day
I just spiked the Expo marker
Oh, Halo
(Mission accomplished, mission accomplished, what's the time on the clock?)
I think it's like 5am, it's 5am, we put in a significant day...
5: 30. 5: 30 in the morning
Love it... I woke up about 23 hours ago, 23 and a half hours ago
And now...
Wyman doesn't even have a kid, that's just dedication
I couldn't sleep, our son woke up and I just couldn't fall back sleep, 'cause I was like "okay I can start coming up with ideas now"
