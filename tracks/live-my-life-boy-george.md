I tell you baby, this is no way to live
Make sacrifies, 'til there's nothing to give
Everyone says there's rules to obey
I can't follow when things never change

Holding my chequebook, got a leak in the pipe
Food on the table, but the landlord's knocked twice
I want more than the shirt on my back
I've worked too hard just to repeat the past

Satisfaction can be hard to find
I go crazy keeping it all inside

Ain't nobody's business
How I live my life
I learnt my lesson
Whether it's wrong or right
Ain't nobody baby
Gonna tell me how
I should live my life
Do live my way now

The?roof is leaking, stack of pillows on my bed
No way to wake up, all the dreams in my head
Phone don't ring, got no man on the line
Things could be better but I still feel fine

Who can say what tomorrow will bring
You give nothing, expecting everything

Ain't nobody's business
How I live my life
I learnt my lesson
Whether it's wrong or right
Ain't nobody baby
Gonna tell me how
I should live my life
Do live my way now

Satisfaction can be hard to find
I go crazy keeping it all inside

Ain't nobody's business
How I live my life
I learnt my lesson
Whether it's wrong or right
Ain't nobody baby
Gonna tell me how
I should live my life
Do live my way now
