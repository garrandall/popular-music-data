Young girl, be true now
To the boy who rea'lly loves you
Don't do him wrong, cause he'll pick up his shoes and walk
And say it's all your fault

Youve got to beware, baby, baby

Oh, youve got to
Keep him from the hands of the wicked
Youve got to
Look out, baby, baby, ah yeah
Or hold on to your one way ticket

Cause true love only comes, it seems, one time
Don't miss that boat or you might be left behind
If youve got a good man and you blow his mind, baby
I'm gonna leave you with this line--and that line is
The sly the slick the wicked wicked wicked each other
They'll never make it, baby

No, no, no - they all try to fake ya

Cause the sly - he's got a fly, fly alibi
For all the unnecessary tears that a woman like you might cry
The slick - he thinks he's so, so quick
And he'll try to pull the wool over your eyes
But remember - there's one more
And he's the wicked - he shows you a good time
He's gonna gain your confidence, baby - and he'll leave you behind
Girl, remember

They'll never make it, baby, no, no, no

I want you to remember this song
