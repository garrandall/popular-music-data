The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates
There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
But wow, am I so ready for this change
Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone
I can't wait to meet everyone! (gasp)
What if I meet... the one?
Tonight imagine me gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face
But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've had so far
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

But it's only for today

It's only for today

It's agony to wait

It's agony to wait

Tell the guards to open up the gates

The gates

For the first time in forever

Don't let them in, don't let them see

I'm getting what I'm dreaming of

Be the good girl you always have to be

A chance to change my lonely world

Conceal

A chance to find true love

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!
