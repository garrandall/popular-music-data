My number one: There could never be no one like you
How come I feel this way about
My number two: Never tried to tell me what to say or do
I'm so in love with two
I don't want to push it
I don't want to fight
But this feeling keeps me up all night

If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breakin' all my rules because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is I'm so in love with two

Hey, hey, hey
I don't know what to do
Hey, hey, hey
I choose the both of you

My number one: You give me everything I need
But some things still are better with
My number two: He's the one that really makes me feel so good
I'm so in love with two
I don't want to push it
I don't want to fight
But this feeling keeps me up all night

If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breakin' all my rules because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is I'm so in love with two

But the problem is I'm so in love with two

Hey, hey, hey
I don't know what to do
Hey, hey, hey
I choose the both of you

Don't want to fight another night
Just want to make it right
C'mon
Oh, my number one, oh, my number two
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My number one, my number two
Somebody tell me
I'm so in love with two

If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breakin' all my rules because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is I'm so in love with two

If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breakin' all my rules because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is I'm so in love with two

Hey, hey, hey
I choose the both of you
