I know a perfect place to put the beat
Right on the bottom of your feet
The music's pumping through my veins
Everything 's in motion, feels so strange

The night's all colors, Coney island's in my head
The rhythm is so heavy, it 's waking the dead
The alls are shaking, my eyes are turning red
With the night pulse

And it's the night pulse
Fever's running high
It's the night pulse
Lighting city lights
It's the night pulse
Oh yeah

Cats in the alley, full moons in the sky
Mary's on the phone, just looking for a guy
She's getting ready for a party time
Yes she is

Vibrations getting strong, shooting through my brain
Everyone's acting just a little insane
Rock and roll I can 't stop playing

And it 's the night pulse
Fever's running high
It 's the night pulse
Lighting city lights
It's the night pulse
Oh yeah

It's the night pulse
People getting wild
It's the night pulse
Fever 's on the rise
It's the night pulse
Oh yeah

You can feel the magic in the air
Taste the heat of passion if you date

And it's the night pulse
Fever's running high
It's the night pulse
The city comes alive
It's the night pulse
Oh yeah

It's the night pulse
The mama wants to dance
It's the night pulse
She's always grabbing her hands
It's the night pulse

People getting wild
Fever's on the rise
It's the night pulse
Oh yeah
