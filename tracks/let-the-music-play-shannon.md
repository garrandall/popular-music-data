Long live the summertime
Just let the sun shine down
From the Alice plains to the Oceanside
Let's crank the music loud
See the southern stars rise in the sky
Playing guitars in the heat
Singing long live the summertime
Just keep me young and free

Got tunes on tap, beers on ice
The BBQ fired up just right
The blue sky lightin' up the red dirt by sea
Playing Back in Black in an outback pub
Gonna tie one on in the diesel and dust
You can feel that heat arisin' in this town
That's what I'm talking bout

Long live the summertime
Just let the sun shine down
From the Alice plains to the Oceanside
Let's crank the music loud
See the southern stars rise in the sky
Playing guitars in the heat
Singing long live the summertime
Just keep me young and free

See a working man, he works the land
He's building dreams with working hands
Apples of his eye don't fall far from that tree
Now the Spring is done, the earth is ripe
The hot sun says it's harvest time
Rolling fields of gold over sunburn ground
That's what it's all about

Long live the summertime
Just let the sun shine down
From the Alice plains to the Oceanside
Let's crank the music loud
See the southern stars rise in the sky
Playing guitars in the heat
Singing long live the summertime
Just keep me young and free

Been on the road, seen a thousand smiles
Horizon golden brown
The rainbow serpent paints the sky
And drives away the clouds

Long live the summertime
Just let the sun shine down
From the Alice plains to the Oceanside
Let's crank the music loud
See the southern stars rise in the sky
Playing guitars in the heat
Singing long live the summertime
Just keep me young and free

Long live the summer
Long live the summer
Long live the summer
Long live the summer
