We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played
While our bodies
Displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance


I thought it was clear
The plan was we would share
This feeling just between ourselves
But when the music changed
The plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else

We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?
Love said


Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)

Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
No, no, no


He tried pretending
A dance is just a dance
But I see
He's dancing his way back to me
Guess he's discovered

We are truly lovers
Magic from the very start
'Cause love just kept me groovin'
And he felt me movin'
Even though we danced apart


So we started dancing
And love put us into the groove
As soon as we started to move
As soon as we started to move
Love said


Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)

Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
No, no, no


He tried pretending
A dance is just a dance
But I see
He's dancing his way back to me
He's dancing his way back to me
Love said
(Let the music play)

Let the music play
(He won't get away)
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)
Let the music play
He won't get away...
