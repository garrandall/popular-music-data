All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passing time
Kinda just passing thru
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I'll take a left at the bank
And I'll head straight thru town
So baby put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
Cause I'm on my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile


All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you...
On my way to you...
On my way to you...
