On a perfect day,
I know that I can count on you.
When that's not possible,
Tell me, can you weather the storm?


'Cause I need somebody who will stand by me.
Through the good times and bad times,
She will always, always be right there.

Sunny days.
Everybody loves them.
Tell me, baby, can you stand the rain?
Storms will come.
This we know for sure.
(this we know for sure.)
Can you stand the rain?


Yeah, yeah.
Love unconditional I'm not asking just of you.
And, girl, to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done.


But I need somebody who will stand by me.
When it's tough she won't run.
She will always be right there for me.

Sunny days.
Everybody loves them.
Tell me, baby, can you stand the rain.
Storms will come.
I know I know all the days won't be perfect,
(this we know for sure.)
But tell me can you stand it?
Can you stand the rain?

Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?


No pressure.
No pressure from me, baby.
(this we know for sure).
'Cause I want you and I need you, and I love you, girl.
Tell me, baby, can you stand the rain?


Will you be there for me?


Come on, baby, let's go get wet.

Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Will you be there, girl?
Can you stand the rain?
Storms will come for sure.
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?

Can you stand the rain?
This we know for sure.
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
This we know for sure.
Can you stand the rain?

Can you stand the rain?
This we know for sure.
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?


Yeah. It's hard, but I'll know I'll be right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Can you stand the rain?
