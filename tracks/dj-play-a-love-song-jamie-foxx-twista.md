I know you see me lookin' at you
And I know he know you lookin' at me
Well...damn


DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, beat it, beat it


I can see how you want it baby
Wish ya man wasn't here with ya baby
I can see (ha) curiosity (ha ha)
Gotcha wanna try me (ha ha)
Homeboy can't please ya (ha ha)
On this wall in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby
(Ha Ha) you want it
(ha ha)I know it
(ha ha)Gotta notion to pull yo ass up outta here

Baby, I got things that I wanna say
Won't you meet me in the bathroom
We can pull a freaky episode, I got my beretta if the nigga come through
Baby, I know he ain't treatin' you right Lady, look at yo bad ass
(turn around) oh(turn around) oohdamn you fine) ohoh ohoohoh

Tell me why he did you wrong
Need to get up with the Twista I been sippin' on Patron
Stroke it when I hold them legs up
He can take you out to dinner and look like a playa
I'm a give it to you good up in the elevator
He be actin' all soft when he get in them draws
I'm a break you off and fuck you up against the wall
Finna move up in that slot cuz I'm somethin' he not
and he don't know what he got, I'm in the drop top
To get the twat I got a knot, no more runnin' from the cops
now I'm rollin' with Foxx because the block's hot
But I'm always a G, cuz I come from the streets and I got heat for whoever thinkin' they want some
No more fuckin' with them lames, now you rollin' with a thug, so tell that nigga to beat it, beat it



DJ play this girl a song
Turned her out, damn that clown, ain't been down

DJ play this girl a song
