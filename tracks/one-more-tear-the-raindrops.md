Gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
Gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah

I only got one more tear to cry over you
Yeah just one more tear and baby I'm through
Just let it trickle down the cheek in the middle of the night
No cussin no fussin no fight
I'll just be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
Gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah

I only got one more tear and then I'll be dry
Yeah just one more tear and baby goodbye
Tell one more lie and make me cry
By the time they hit the floor
I'll be packed won't be back no more
Yeah I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah

I'll quit when the whistle blows
I'll get where the 
 better watch your step

Now I only got one more tear to cry over you
Yeah just one more tear and baby I'm through
Just let it trickle down the cheek in the middle of the night
No cussin no fussin no fight
I'll just be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
I'll be gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
Gone gone gone gone yeah yeah yeah
