That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
Sometimes I get lost in my confusion
It's something that I need to talk about
Old romance it's just a no-delusion
Don't you know we could've worked this out
I see your face and not just 'cause I'm lonely
I can't erase the touch of your hand
It's you I need and you that I will only
I'm trying baby just as hard as I can
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
Baby if you only take a listen
To my heart I know you'd understand
One moment is worth the dime for giving
I'll never leave you darling never again
I reach out to whatever you may need now
Why you turn your back I can't understand
So now I'm searching for the words to make you see how
I love you just as much as any man can
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
Baby baby baby I'm in love with you
To show you what my love is all I really wanna do
There's no other man that can do you like I can
So why you turn your back I can't understand
You say you're looking for love but it's right in front of you
Oh what I gotta do to get through to you
I'm lying in my bed awake at night
Like Keith Sweat said something's just ain't right
'Cause all I can do is think of you
And just how much I'm in love with you
Ooh baby I'm crazy with infatuation
And when you left such devastation
Came over me that I could not see
Just how much you meant to me
It's like I'm hanging from a rope without no sling
Like the Jackson Five said I want you back
Listen girl I need you desperately
I'll make it up to you
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
That's why baby baby baby
That's why I've got to see you again
