If we were older
We wouldn't have to be worried tonight

Baby oh, I wanna be with you
So bad, (yes, I wanna be with you)
Oh, darlin' (oh, I wanna be with you)
Oh yeah (yeah, I wanna be with you)
Well tonight's (tonight) the night
We always knew it would feel so right
So come on baby, I just wanna be with you

Someday's a long time
And we've been waiting so long to be here

Hold me tight
Our love could live forever after tonight
If you believe that what we're doing is right
Close your eyes and be still
