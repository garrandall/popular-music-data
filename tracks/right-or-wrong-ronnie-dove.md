Right or wrong I'll be with you (right or wrong I'll be with you)
I'll do what you want me to (I'll do what you want me to)
I believe that I belong (I believe that I belong)
By your side, right or wrong (right or wrong)

Right or wrong, it's gotta be (right or wrong, it's gotta be)
Always you, always me (always you and always me)
Won't you take me along (won't you take me along)
To be with you right or wrong (right or wrong)

If it's wrong to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you say you love me
My life with you I'll share

Right or wrong, day by day (right or wrong, day by day)
All my love, all the way (all my love, all the way)
I believe that I belong (I believe that I belong)
By your side, right or wrong
Right or wrong!
