(Inside, outside)
(Inside, outside)

Oh, darling let me in
It's raining outside
Please let forgive me soren
It's raining outside

Oh, let my arms return
To hold you near me
Your darling heart must learn
I love you dearly

Oh, darling please be kind
Don't leave me outside
Outside your heart am I
Oh, take me inside

The rings in my heart
And my heart cries
Our love dies
Our love dies

It's inside raining outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside

The rings in my heart
And my heart cries
Our love dies
Our love dies

It's inside raining outside inside
Inside, outside
