What kind of fool am I
Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one
That I have been thinking of
What kind of girl is this
An empty shell, a lonely cell
In which an empty heart must dwell

What kind of lips are these
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other girl
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool am I

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other girl
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool am I
