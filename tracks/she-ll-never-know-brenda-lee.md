I wish the very best to you and your new love
And all you do
Don't worry about my love for you
She'll never know, oh never know

Oh how I wish I could forget
But secretly I love you yet
But if she's the one I've no regrets
She'll never know

I'm the one you told goodbye
I'm the one that you made cry
And I'm the one who's lips you taught to kiss

Yes, I'm the one who's lonely now
But I'm gonna get by, someway, somehow
She'll take your hand, but I'll take this vow
She'll never know

I'm the one you told goodbye
I'm the one that you made cry
And I'm the one who's lips you taught to kiss

Whoa oh oh, I'm the one who's lonely now
But, I'll get by someway, somehow
She'll take your hand, but I'll take this vow
She'll never know
