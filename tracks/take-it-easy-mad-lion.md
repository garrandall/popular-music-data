Too many suckers and not enough time
To buck up all of dem with one clip from mi 9
To shoot to kill, dem seh mi don't care
I try to kill, but it nuh get mi nowhere
I just put down mi gun inna fi mi suitcase
Big up mi fist, fi buck off dem face
Flip!, script!
And a guy head lick
Boof!, baff!
And not one shot lick, cau'
Toe to toe once again
Fi distinguish real bad bwoys dem
And if yuh a bad bwoy, not a guy caan try
Let mi see di fist dem


Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Me no know...


Dutty bwoy jump up, dutty bwoy get
STOMP
Get perpetrator, a guy get
STOMP
Some guy cool, but him need fi get
STOMP
If dem buy dem back dem guns, seh dem run outta luck

Cau' we kill dem all
And we come back aloooone, chi boom deh
Mad Lion
Deh pon microphoooooooone
Alright

So just step up, step up
Bwoy, whats up?
Put your crew to di side, tek out yuh gold front
Knuckle up, knuckle up, and guard yuh grill
No need fi gun, cau' yuh get hurt still
Think unuh wicked?, Tell dem fi come!
I have mi fist, mi nuh need not a gun
Nah guh touch you, if you don't touch mi first
If you touch mi bwoy, you must bite di dust
Bad bwoy, rude bwoy, fickle face nah skin up
Decent person, with an evil touch
I don't bother nobody
I tansoback and clutch
You diss the program bwoy you must get-, Ah!


Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Me no know...


Too many suckers and not a enough time
To buck dem all off with di clip from mi 9
So shoot to kill, dem seh, mi don't care
I try to kill but it nuh get mi nowhere
Flip inna mi pocket, and mi dip inna mi waist
Tek out mi gun, put inna mi suitcase
Big up mi fist, and you know mi run di place
One, thump-thump, inna bwoy dem face
Two, thump-thump, and we tear dung di place
Three, thump-thump, and him cannot escape
Cannot escape, cannot escape
Cannot mi seh, cannot mi seh, cannot escape, cau'
Toe to toe once again
Fi distinguish real bad bwoys dem
And if yuh a bad bwoy, not a guy caan try
Mek mi see yuh fist dem
Cause I'm not a deejay, and I'm not a MC
I'm one bwoy to 'member of di group, BDP
Step to we crew, bwoy it's no problem
We have di fist, and it quick fi solve them (WAH)
Have fi mi gun, but it inna mi waist
Pick up mi fist, just to punch off yuh face
Mad Lion deh yah, and we wicked and bad
Love fi mi fist, and mi gun, next to God
Use fi mi fist, cau' mi up inna line
Wicked bad bwoy, run tings every time


Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Me no know...


All dem a talk and defend
Can't stop mi from love di gyal dem
Gyal pon di left, and gyal pon di right
Two a dem combine and waan fight
One throw a punch, one tek out a knife
And nearly kill di gyal, and tek weh her life
Tell mi crowd of people, is that right?
Make gyal, a kill gal, fi man weh she like?
I don't like that damn flex inna mi zone
Need dem gyal fi just keep dem ass home
Mad Lion deh yah
Deh pon di tune
Boy's deh, we wicked and bad to di bone
That's why..


Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Why?
Gotta take it easy
Me no know...
