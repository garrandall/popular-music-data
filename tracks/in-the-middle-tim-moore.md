They laid out the body
In that peaceful pagan home
To pay their last respects
All the neighbours came along

In the wee hours of the morning
Pagan words from a whisky still
Fall in from the bushes
Sworn enemies are friends again

Someone spilt Porter on the corpse
In the middle of a song
And the stories kept on coming back
From 1941

Sail on, sail on Jimmy
Sail on, Jimmy boy
Sail on, sail on Jimmy
From this Irish Pagan ritual

Mad Mary from the crossroads
Grabbed my arse for all to see
I'll tell your fortune Scoby
If you come on home with me

In the name of God now Mary
Some respect for the dead
You can't be grabbing arses
At a Pagan ritual

Sail on, sail on Jimmy
Sail on, Jimmy boy
Sail on, sail on Jimmy
From this Irish Pagan ritual

Father Tim is telling Tommy
How the Israelites came in
And Tommy's eating sandwiches
That are piled up next to him

Someone started singing
Ah Revenge for Skibereen
There's a French lad there translating
For the next door neighbours daughter
Jean Louis and lovely Angelie

Sail on, sail on Jimmy
Sail on, Jimmy boy
Sail on, sail on Jimmy
From this Irish Pagan ritual

In the wee hours of the morning
We were howling at the moon
When the Mystic wind took Jimmy
Way up to the Mystic room

Up up up up up he's gone
In peace to save us all
Gone with a Mystic blessing
From that peaceful Pagan ritual

Sail on, sail on Jimmy
Sail on, Jimmy Boy
Sail on, sail on Jimmy
From this Irish Pagan ritual

Sail on, sail on Jimmy
Sail on, Jimmy boy
Sail on, sail on Jimmy
From this Irish Pagan ritual
