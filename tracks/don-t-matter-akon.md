Ok, Akon, Stay outta trouble now son, Akon, Stay outta trouble now son



Let me tell you what hurts the most, I'm a convicted felon and I can't work. No matter where I
Go I try to get paid, they never give me good job cause they are afraid-that-I'ma stick 'em up,
Oh yes, stick it, rob the manager and everybody in it. That's the everyday life of a
Convict-tryin to make it.Why their saying to me -



The judges said dont trouble nobody.
Probation said dont trouble nobody.
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody. 
And i'ma try not to trouble nobody.



Me an' my niggas on the block all day - blocking dimes - lookin out for police. Cause this the
Type of shit that we go through up in the ghetto just to make some cheese. The street type got me
Gettin locked up about 5-6 times a week. And then i make mon'- take it from the profit of the
Weed. All this just to feed my seeds (yeah.)

I gotta stop this livin. I witness one too many killings. I don seen the hardest nigga street
Talk to the clown that was never ever found. Sooo



The judges said dont trouble nobody.
Probation said dont trouble nobody.
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody. 
And i'ma try not to trouble nobody.



I'm trying to stay away from trouble everyday, but its hard when the things you need. Picture
Lookin at your babies in the face when they hungry and they need to eat. I'm tryin not to do
Wrong - But they wont let me do right. Even tho I done changed my life criminal records' what
They judging me by. -thats why



The judges said dont trouble nobody.
Probation said dont trouble nobody.
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody. 
And i'ma try not to trouble nobody.

My mamma said dont trouble nobody.
My Pappa said dont trouble nobody.
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody.
And i'ma try not to trouble nobody (so i wont trouble nobody)

The judges said dont trouble nobody (can't trouble nobody.)
Probation said dont trouble nobody (wont trouble nobody.)
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody (wont trouble nobody.)
And I'ma try not to trouble nobody (So I wont trouble nobody.)

My mamma said dont trouble nobody (can't trouble nobody.)
My Pappa said dont trouble nobody (won't trouble nobody.)
Stay outta trouble dont trouble nobody (wont trouble nobody.)
And i'ma try not to trouble nobody (yeah.)
