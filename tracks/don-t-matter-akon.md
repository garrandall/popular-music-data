Konvict
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh


Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight
Oh, yes, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)


Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on yo' side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize
But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied


Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight
Oh, yes, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)


Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you
Puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true
And they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me
And why I love you, baby


Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight
Oh, yes, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)


Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
'Cause I got you, babe
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
'Cause I got you, babe
'Cause I got you, babe
'Cause I got you, babe


Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
'Cause we gon' fight
Oh, yes, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('Cause I got you, babe)
