You don't know me, but I'm your brother,
I was raised here in this living hell.
You don't know my kind in your world,
Pretty soon the time will tell.

You telling me the things you're gonna do for me,
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see.

Takin' it to the streets,
Takin' it to the streets,
Takin' it to the streets,
Takin' it to the...

Get this message to my brother,
You will find him everywhere.
Wherever people live together,
Tied in poverty, despair...

Oh you,
Telling me the things you're gonna do for me,
Oh now,
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see.

Takin' it to the streets,
Takin' it to the streets,
Takin it to the streets,
Takin it to the streets.
