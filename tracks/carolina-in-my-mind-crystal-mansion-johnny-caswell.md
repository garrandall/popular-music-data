In my mind, I'm going to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
And ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind
And I'm going to Carolina in my mind


Karen, she's the silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing
Now I'm crying, ain't I
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That loves the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind

And, hey, babe, the sky's on fire
I'm dying, ain't I
I'm going to Carolina in my mind


In my mind, I'm going to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
And ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind
And I'm going to Carolina in my mind


Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have
Heard the highway calling
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
And signs that might be omens say
I'm going, going, I'm going
To Carolina in my mind

Now with a holy host of
Others standing round me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
It looks like this goes on
Like this forever
You must forgive me if I'm up


In my mind, I'm going to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
And ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind
And I'm going to Carolina in my mind


Well, gonna get back home again
Gotta make it back to Carolina soon
I wanna get back on home again soon
Yeah, Lord, and I gotta get back
To Carolina soon

Carolina in my mind
Wanna get back on home again soon
I wanna get back to Carolina soon
I wanna get back on home again soon

I gotta get back to Carolina soon
I wanna get back on home again soon
Gotta get back to Carolina soon...
