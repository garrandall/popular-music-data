How can you say life's getting you down
Get yourself out go along with the crowd
You're all dressed up got nowhere to go
You feel left out cause nobody showed
listen babe

When you think you're the only one
Who can't find love in this world
Tell yourself there's another one
Who's waiting for you, somewhere

Somebody special is thinking of you
Somebody special is dreaming of you
Somebody special is longing for you
Somebody special, special

Magazine dreams are easy stuff
But heaven knows they ain't good enough
Picture yourself from reel to reel
And get your hands on that driving wheel
And you know what

When it's hard to satisfy
A simple simple fantasy
Somebody somewhere is on your side
Waiting for you, crying

Somebody special, is looking for you
Somebody special, is searching for you
Somebody special, is waiting for you
Somebody special, somebody special

Maybe your heart's tormenting you
Why should it have any reason to
Wipe off that negativity
Put on some positivity

And when you think you're the only one
Who can't find love in this world
Tell yourself there's another one
Who's waiting for you, somewhere

Somebody special, is dreaming of you
Somebody special, is looking for you
Somebody special, is waiting for you
Somebody special, somebody special
