Girl we made it to the top
We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together building castles in the air
We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

I miss the Hungry Years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the World
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears

I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday

I miss the Hungry Years
The once upon a time the lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the World I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the Hungry years
I miss the Hungry Years
