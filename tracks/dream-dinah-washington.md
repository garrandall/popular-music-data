Darn that dream, I dream each night
You say you love me, and you hold me tight
But when I awake, I find your out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips, and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlight skys
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one track, mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
Lord I'd welcome a nice old, nightmare

Darn that dream, and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me, 'cause it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream

Oh, darn that dream
