Too bad for me, too bad
I'll be your fool again
Because I love you, yes, I do
You're now with someone new
While I wait in vain for you
It's too bad, too bad
My heart must pay
You know I've thought of you
Holding him tenderly
Telling him things you told to me
I know it was all wrong, my sweet
I wonder what's come over you
It's too bad, too bad
But I must pay
You didn't mind not seeing me
Every, every, every day
Oh, waiting weeks by the telephone
I'm sorry for the way
I mistreated you
You were all alone It's sad, my dear, it's sad
I'm sure we're both to blame
Some day again our hearts will meet
Until that day comes
I'll leave you in his arms
And I'll say too bad
But I must pay
And I'll say too bad
But I must pay
Baby, baby, baby
It's bad but I must pay
And I know, I know that it's
Terrible, terrible, darling
But I've got to pay
Baby, and it's bad, bad...
