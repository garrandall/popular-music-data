Life is funny, the tricks it plays
Can't help believing in the hands of fate
When I met you my heart stood still
Like a puppet hanging on your reel
Touch me and my knees start to shiver
Can't help for losing control
Kiss me and my lips start to quiver
What are you trying to do to my soul


It's such a crazy love the way we're makin' love
I can't get enough of your crazy love
Gotta have your sexy stuff
What sweet love to be stuck on your crazy love

I'm crazy!


I say one thing, you do another
The only time that we agree is
When we're with each other
But it's worth it, the magic that we make
It's like we're floatin' somewhere out in space
Take me on a long enchanted evening
I want a donkey ride
Take me into the fantasy of living
Sweep me away, let me fly by your side




Crazy love, what a strange effect it has on me
I just get so crazy, love
Drifting into ecstasy
Feeling you so close to me
Hey hey, crazy love
Talkin' about that crazy love

 (3x)


Oh, crazy love!
Crazy love
Oh yeah
I can never get enough
You're just so sexy to me
I will never never never
Crazy, crazy, crazy...
I will never, never, never, never, never
Oh no, no no...
