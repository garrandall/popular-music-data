Uh huh shattered, uh huh shattered
Love and hope and sex and dreams
Are still surviving on the street
Look at me, I'm in tatters
I been shattered
Shattered


Friends are so alarming
And my lover's never charming
Life's just a cocktail party on the street
Big Apple
People dressed in plastic bags
Directing traffic   ((6661646), shattered)
Some kind of fashion   ((6661646), shattered)


Laughter, joy, and loneliness and sex and sex and sex and sex
Look at me, I'm in tatters
I been shattered
Shattered


All this chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter about
Shmatta, shmatta, shmatta, I can't give it away on 7th Avenue
This town's been wearing tatters, uh huh   (Shadoobie, shattered)
Work and work for love and sex
Ain't you hungry for success, success, success, success
Does it matter? (Shattered)

Does it matter?


Ahhh, look at me, I'm a shattered
I'm a shattered
Look at me, I'm a shattered, yeah


Pride and joy and greed and sex
That's what makes that town the best
Pride and joy and dirty dreams and still surviving on the street (shattered)
And look at me, I'm in tatters, yeah (shattered)

I'm in tatters, what does it matter (shattered)
Does it matter, uh-huh (shattered)
Does it matter? Uh-huh
I'm shattered
Mm-mm, I'm shattered

Huh shadoobie, shattered
Huh shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered

Don't you know the crime rate's going up, up, up, up, up?  (Shadoobie, shattered)
To live in this town you must be tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough  (Shadoobie, shattered)  (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)

We've got rats on the west side, bed bugs uptown  (Shadoobie, shattered)
What a mess, this town's in tatters, I've been shattered  (Shadoobie, shattered)
My brain's been battered, splattered all over Manhattan  (Shadoobie, shattered)

Shadoobie, shattered, shattered
What I say?
Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered


This town's full of money grabbers   (Shadoobie, shattered)
Go ahead, bite the Big Apple, don't mind the maggots, uh-huh   (Shadoobie, shattered)   (Shadoobie, shattered)

Shadoobie, my brain's been battered   (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
My friends they come around, they flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter   (Shadoobie, shattered)   (Shadoobie, shattered)
Pile it up, pile it up, pile it high on the platter  (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
