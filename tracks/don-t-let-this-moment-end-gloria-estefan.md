Kiss me, hold me, touch me
Don't let this moment end

Please, don't let this moment end
At least 'til once again
Our hearts can be together

Please, I've never let you go
But still I need to know
That this night will last forever

Oh please
You know you own my heart
Just tell me where to start
Don't make me wait much longer

Oh please
I know tonight's the night
It never felt so right
Just hold me in your arms and
Kiss me, hold me, touch me
Don't let this moment end

Please, I'm begging you to stay
Just throw the world away
Pretend there's no tomorrow

And I will never leave your side
Never let this feeling die
Just let our love grow stronger

Oh please
You know you own my heart
Just tell me where to start
Don't make me wait much longer

Oh please
I know tonight's the night
It never felt so right
Just hold me in your arms and
Kiss me, hold me, touch me
Don't let this moment end

Can we make this moment last forever
Tell me if you feel the way I do
Ohh, don't let this moment end
Never end

Please
You know you own my heart
Just tell me where to start
Don't make me wait much longer

Oh please
I know tonight's the night
It never felt so right
Just hold me in your arms and
Kiss me, hold me, touch me
Don't let this moment end

Oh please
I know tonight's the night
It never felt so right
Just hold me in your arms
And kiss me
