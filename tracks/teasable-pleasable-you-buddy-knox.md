Teasable, pleasable
Teasable, pleasable

Teasable, pleasable
And you're on my mind
Teasable, pleaseable you

Teasable, pleaseable
Will you be mine
Teasable, pleaseable you

You're the one true love I found
You turn my whole world upside down
'Cause you make my dreams come true
You're my teasable, pleaseable you

Teasable, pleasable
Teasable, pleasable

Teasable, pleasable
Will you be mine
Teasable, pleasable you

Teasable, pleaseable
Love all the time
Teasable, pleaseable you

You're the one true love I found
You turn my whole world upside down
'Cause you make my dreams come true
You're my teasable, pleaseable you

My teasable, pleaseable you
My teasable, pleaseable you...
