I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide


Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
And if keeping you and loving you means
Layin' all my troubles down


Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, won't you come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Show me
Here I am, baby


It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half


Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
Keeping you and loving you means
Laying all my troubles down


Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, won't you come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Squeeze it
Here I am, baby


When I'm down I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can
But it don't take much for me
Before my cup runs over
All this love's inside of me
I believe there's going to be an explosion, yeah
You can talk to me, oh baby
I'm in no hurry
Tell me all your troubles
And you won't ever have to worry, no
And one more thing
You just can't trust everybody
Everybody you see, no no
You'll find yourself lost and alone
On a darkened street


Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, would you come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me, hey hey
Take me, hey hey
Show me, won't you?
Here I am, baby, hey hey
Take me, won't you?
Teach me
Baby, won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby
