If ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?


And let it be like they said it could be
Me loving you girl, and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?


Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older
So darling, you run to me


And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you, and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?


And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
