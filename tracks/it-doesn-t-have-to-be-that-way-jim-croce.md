Snowy nights and Christmas lights
Icy windowpanes
Make me wish that we could be
Together again
And the windy winter avenues
Just don't seem the same
And the Christmas carols sound like blues
But the choir is not to blame

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
We could easily get it together tonight
It's only right

Crowded stores, the corner Santa Claus
Tinseled afternoons
And the sidewalk bands play their songs
Slightly out of tune
Down the windy winter avenues
There walks a lonely man
And if I told you who he is
Well I think you'd understand

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
We could easily get it together tonight
It's only right

No, it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
We could easily get it together tonight
It's only right
