The first time I made love
It wasn't love at all
Didn't know what to feel, it didn't seem real
Thats all I can recall
I thought thats all there was
Now I know so much more
Now I know I never really made love before
Ill tell you when I knew
The last time I made love, I made it with you
The first time we made love
It was all that it could be
Your soul in mine, suspended in time
Blended perfectly
The magic that we made
Is something that lives on
Refusing to die, though I try to believe its gone
Once truth is always true
The last time I made love, I made it with you
Now lovers come and go
People give themselves too easily
But through it all how sweet it is
No matter what I do, when theres someone new
That last time I made love
I made it with you
