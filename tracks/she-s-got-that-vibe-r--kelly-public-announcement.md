You could be my girl, and I could be your guy

There, isn't that nice? You'll have no fear, yo
Kiss me you fool and make me melt like butter
When it comes to sayin', "I love you", I won't st-st-st-stuttter
I'll turn you on like a neon light
Make everything alright, like in the middle of the night
Yo, when you need somebody to love you
Like Flintstones, we'll have a yabbadabbadoo
Kiss and caress you and hold you and my word is bond
