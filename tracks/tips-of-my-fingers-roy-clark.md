I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
Oh, but that was as close as I came

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
That it's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right through my hands

Yes, I let you slip right through my hands...
