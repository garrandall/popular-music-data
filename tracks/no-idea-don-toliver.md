Since you've been gone, I've been just okay
I know you mad, you didn't see it my way
Since I've been gone, I've been out of space
I let lil' shawty, come here, take your place

Oh, you got it (Got it)
You couldn't keep my love, you too exotic (Couldn't keep my love, yeah)
You want a paper plane, I don't mind it (You want a paper plane, yeah)
You wonder why your girl always whining (Wonder why your girl, yeah)
