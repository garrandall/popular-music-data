Jump up on this train, girl try it
I told you money ain't no thang, girl I'll buy it
I'm talkin diamond rings and designer clothes
Since I seen you on that video, 
How could I tell Ciara no? (No, no, no, no)
You ridin' on that thing like a rodeo-deo-deo
Round and round and round
Here we go, we go, we go, we go
She ridin' that like a sports car
Ridin that like a porn star
If you wanna ride Bei Maejor let me know 


I can do it big
I can do it long
I can do whenever or however you want

I can do it up and down
I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnist
This one is my circus

I market it so good
They can't wait to try-i-i-i-i me
I work it so good
Man, these niggas
Tryna buy-i-i-i-i me

They love they way I ride it 
They love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat, I ride it

They love they way I ride it 
They love the way I ride the beat
Like a muthafucking freak

And I won't stop, don't stop.
Get it! Get it!
Imma pitch down the middle
Baby hit it! hit it!

I do it to him right
Handle my business, like a big girl should
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock
2 o'clock, 4....
5 o'clock, 6 o'clock
Baby give me more.

I can do it big
I can do it long
I can do whenever or however
You want

I can do it up and down
I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnist
This one is my circus

I market it so good
They can't wait to try-i-i-i-i me
I work it so good
Man, these niggas
Tryna buy-i-i-i-i me

They love they way I ride it 
They love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat, I ride it

They love they way I ride it 
They love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherfucking freak

And I won't stop, don't stop.
Get it! Get it!
Imma pitch down the middle
Baby hit it! hit it!

I do it tonight
Handle my business, like a big girl should
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock
2 o'clock, 4....
5 o'clock, 6 o'clock
Baby give me more.

I market it so good
They can't wait to try-i-i-i-i
Me

He love they way I ride it 
He love the way I ride the beat
Ride ride the beat, I ride it.

He love they way I ride it 
He love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherfucking freak


(I love the way you ride the beat baby, I love it!)
She ride ir like a rollercoaster.
Soon as I get her to the top she screams.
I put her out like a lite,
She'll be out for the night
When her head hit the pollows sweet dreams
Waker her up about 30mins later,
Calling me the terminator, let's go again
Red zone, I'ma get her first down
Call me Luda 
Drew Breeze I throw it in.
Touch down, he scores,
Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that
Cici better CC me.
Cause them legs just keep on going
So I gotta put her to bed.
Let the 808 thump, and the beat go bump,
Cause she ride it like a thoroughbred 


He love they way I ride it 
He love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherfucking freak

Ohh baby baby baby
Do me like you up when I'm up
When I'm done, when I'm done
Ohh baby baby baby
You can stand to look away when
I'm swirling this around.

Oh baby bay you like it
Once it get up and down.
Oh baby he love it when
I twirl this thing around

He love the way I ride it 
He love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherfucking freak
