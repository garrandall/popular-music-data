If she walks out on you
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me

When you're alone and blue
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me

If she's the one you want
Good luck and goodbye
I won't stand in your way
I won't even try

Someday you'll miss my kiss
You'll come knocking on my door
You'll come knocking on my door

But just remember this
I won't want you anymore
I won't want you anymore

When you wake up and find
I'm in your heart and on your mind
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me

When you wake up and find
I'm in your heart and on your mind
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
