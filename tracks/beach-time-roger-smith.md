I was gettin' in beach time
Lyin' on the san
Gettin' in beach time
Workin' on a tan

You were gettin' in beach time
Gazin' at the sea
Then I smiled your way
And you smiled at me

We kissed on the shore
And you said you'd be mine forever more
Then we strolled hand in hand
And we dreamed and we planned

Gettin' in beach time
Thinkin' love is grand
Now we're together
Lyin' in the sand

(You were gettin' in beach time)
(Gazin' at the sea)
(Then I smiled your way)
(And you smiled at me)

(Just gettin' in beach time)
