Start me up


Start me up


Oh, Tommy used to work on the docks
Union’s been on strike
He’s down on his luck
It’s tough
Oh, so tough


Oh, we gotta (Hold on)


Ready or not (Ready or not)


You live for the fight when that's (all that you got)


Start me up


We're halfway there


Oh, woah! Livin' on a prayer


Start me up


We'll make it – I swear


Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer


If you start me up (Uh!)
Kick on the starter give it all you got
You got it (chh), you got it (chh; you got it)
I can’t compete (Ooooo)
With the riders in the other heat
Yeah yeah! (Oh, we gotta)


(Hold on) I'll make a grown man cry (Oh we gotta)
I'll make a grown man (Got each other)


Give it a shot


Start me up


We're halfway there


Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer


Start me up


We'll make it – I swear


Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer


Livin' on a prayer!


Oh we gotta


Hold on, ready or not (Ready or not)


You live for the fight when that's (all that you got)


Oh, (Start me up) We're halfway there


We're halfway there (Woah! Livin' on a prayer!)
Livin' on a prayer!


Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear (Mercedes: Make it I swear, yeah)


Oh! Livin' on a prayer!


Start me up (If you start me up, I'll never stop)
I’ll never stop


Livin' on a prayer (Start me up)


Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear (If you start me up I'll never stop)
Livin' on a prayer (Start me up)
Oh, we're halfway there


Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer (Livin', on a prayer)


Take my hand (Yeah!) and we’ll make it I swear


We're almost there (Ohh!)


We're livin' on a prayer


Living on a prayer


You gotta


Start me up
