Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was meant for you) 
Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was made to groove) 

Here we are in the room together 
Holding hands and it's gonna get better 
And I know that you're in the mood 

So put your purse down and take off your jacket 
Oh girl it's about to get nasty 
You'll love what we gonna do 

Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was meant for you) 
Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was made to groove) 

Won't you pull back the sheets and lay down 
Put your head upon my shoulders 
Let me tell you how I wanna feel 

You're the girl that knows my pleasure 
So let me go down and find my treasure 
Let me see where my pearl is at 

Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was meant for you) 
Lay your head on my pillow 
And just relax, relax, relax 
('cause it was made to groove) 

The cutie pies they all know 
They can always lay on my pillow
