Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart, it's not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a flower, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, oo love hurts

Some fools dream of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness

Some fools fool themselves, I guess, but they're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts, oo love hurts

Some fools dream of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess, but they're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts, love hurts, oo love hurts
Oo love hurts, yeah love hurts
