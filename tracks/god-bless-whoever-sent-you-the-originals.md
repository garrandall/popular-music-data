God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you


You're much too beautiful
To be part of the human race
Whoever carved those features
On your angel face
If I put you on a pedestal
Girl, that's where you belong
I'm building my world around you
So please don't let me down


God bless whoever sent you
'Cause I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
'Cause I really needed you


Oh, you could take a sinner
And turn him into a saint
You took a nervous a guy like me
And made me something that I ain't
Oh, my life was like a dark old room
Until you gave me your love
Now you walk upon all my thoughts
Girl, you're just too much


God bless whoever sent you
'Cause I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
'Cause I really needed you


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Oh, did you know men get butterflies, oh, they really do
Girl, I get butterflies every time I look at you
Honey, what I find in you
I ain't find in anyone else
And if the man above
Made anything better
He kept it for himself


God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you

God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you

God bless whoever sent you
I really needed you
God bless whoever sent you
