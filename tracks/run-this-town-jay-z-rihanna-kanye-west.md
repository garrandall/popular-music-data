Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town


We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma six zeros dot zero
Here Doug
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas
Now we squared up
Hold up


Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
(Is who's gon' run this town tonight)
Hey-hey-hey-hey


We are
Yeah I said it
We are
You can call me Caesar
In a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader
So Eric B. we are
Microphone fiend
It's the return of the God
Peace God
(Auh! Auh!)
And ain't nobody fresher
I'm in Maison
(Ah!)
Martin Margiela
On the table screamin'
Fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw their hand in
'Cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row


Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
(Is who's gon' run this town tonight)
Hey-hey-hey-hey


It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos
Next time I'm in church, please no photos
Police escorts
Everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life
We are on a crash course
What you think I rap for
To push a fucking Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I could spend my whole life good-will-hunting
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, unh
Two bee stings
And I'm beasting
Off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok
Baby
You need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
What's that 'Ye?
Baby, these heels
Is that a may?
What?!
Baby, these wheels
You trippin' when you ain't sippin'
Have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh?
Now you know how we feel


We gon' run this town tonight!


Wassup!
