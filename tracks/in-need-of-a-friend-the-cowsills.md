Cowsill

Ah...
You say you know somebody
Someone who feels down when you're feeling sad
Who's up when you're glad
But I don't know anybody
Haven't a person, don't know where I stand
Gee you're a lucky man
Hey, I need a friend
Not just a wall that I talk to
But a mind having doors I can walk through
I need a friend
Yes, I do
You say you know somebody
Someone who shows you the way when you're lost
At any cost
But I don't have anybody
I grope in the dark and I'm totally blind
Hey don't you think that's unkind?

Hey, I need a friend
Not just a wall that I talk to
But a mind having doors I can walk through
I need a friend
Yes, I do
I think I know somebody
Someone who feels just the way that you do
He reminds me of you
But, you'll have find that body
I'm sorry there's nary a thing I can do
You see it's all up to you
But, you'll find a friend
Not just a wall that you talk to
Just show him the door he can walk through
You'll find a friend
Yes, you can
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
