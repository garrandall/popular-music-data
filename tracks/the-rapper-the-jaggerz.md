Hey girl, I betcha
There's someone out to get ya
You'll find him anywhere
On a bus, in a bar, in a grocery store
He'll say "Excuse me
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?"

Rap-a-rap-a-rap, they call him the Rapper
Rap, rap, rap, you know what he's after

So he starts his rappin'
Hoping something will happen
He'll say he needs you
A companion, a girl he can talk to
He's made up his mind
He needs someone to sock it to

Rap-a-rap-a-rap, they call him the rapper
Rap, rap, rap, you know what he's after

He's made an impression
So he makes a suggestion
Come up to my place
For some coffee, or tea, or me
He's got you where he wants you
Girl, you gotta face reality

Rap-a-rap-a-rap, they call him the rapper
Rap, rap, rap, you know what he's after
Rap, rap, rap, they call him the rapper
