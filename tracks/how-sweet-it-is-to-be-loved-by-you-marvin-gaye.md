How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion


I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby


How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby


How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else


I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby


How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
