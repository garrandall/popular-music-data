You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you
For waiting patiently

Daddy's home
Your daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side

Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home
Your daddy's home to stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
(All I could do was cry)

But I made a promise that you treasured
I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes

Daddy's home
Your daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
Daddy's home to stay
I'm gonna be here come what may
Daddy's home to stay
