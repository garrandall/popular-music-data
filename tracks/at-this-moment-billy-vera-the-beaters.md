What did you think I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling I love you
And you know I'd never hurt you-oo-wo-oo-o-o-o...

What do you think I would give at this moment
If you'd stay I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you
If I, could just hold you

If I
If I could just hold you
Again
