Come on everybody, everybody, everybody
C C Come on everybody

I'm gonna sing my song

It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist
We're gonna do the twist
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this
C'mon let's twist again like we did last summer
Yeah let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Yeah let's twist again twistin' time is here

Hey, hey, hey, hey hey baby won't you take a chance
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Oh let's dance
Oh let's dance
Oh do the twist, the stomp, the mash potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, oh let's dance

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Good golly, Good golly, Good golly Miss Molly
You sure like to ball
Good golly Miss Molly
You sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

C'mon C C C'mon baby, let's do the twist
C'mon baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And do the twist

On your marks, get set
On your marks, get set
On your marks, get set
On your marks, get set

Well I should have known it from the very start
This girl'll leave me with a broken heart
Listen people what I'm tellin' you
I keep away from runaround Sue yeah
I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
Woah Woah Woah
Oh baby that's the one I like
Who's that flyin' up there
Is it a bird (No)
Is it a plane (No)
Is it the twister (Yeah)
Yeah let's twist again like we did last summer
Come on let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Come on, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Yeah round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so and then
Come on twist again like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again, like we did last year
Great balls, great balls, great balls, great balls of fire
On your marks, good golly, get set, good golly
On your marks, good golly, get set, good golly
On your marks, good golly, get set, good golly
Now ready, ready, go

Oh baby that's the one I like, like, ike, ke
