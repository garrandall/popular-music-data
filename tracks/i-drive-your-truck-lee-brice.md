Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash

Dog tags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back

This thing burns gas like crazy
but that's alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and I've got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah, man, I crank it up

And you'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down on my face
Hey, man, I'm tryna be tough

And momma asked me this morning
If I'd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain't where I feel you anyway

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I'm missing you this much

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes, brother, sometimes I drive your truck

I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
I drive your truck
