I was out at the Old Mill town
A week ago today
What I saw was a small gas lamp
And pots made out of clay

When I wiped off a little dust
Smoke began to rise
Out of a cloud came a frightful sight
Of people running, child

And they sang, la la la la...

When I sat down beside the lamp
I couldn't believe my eyes
They were blowing a bubble pipe
About two times the size

As they sang, la la la la...

It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing this song

It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing
A happy song

It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing
A happy song
