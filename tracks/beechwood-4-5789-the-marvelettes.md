You can have this dance with me
You can hold my hand and whisper in my ear
Sweet words that I love to hear

Oh, baby, don't be shy
Just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine

I've been waiting, standing here so patiently
For you to come over and have this dance with me

And my number is beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date any old time

Don't be shy
Just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine

And my number is beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date any old time
