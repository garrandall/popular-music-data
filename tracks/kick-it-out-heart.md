Out of the street - get on home
Tail shaking filly running on her own
They say she got loose on the night she was born
Cranking it up in a school zone

'Kick it out - kick it out!' she said
'Kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive - kick it out!'

Sitting in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love getting high getting down
Sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach

Wild music blowing in her mane
She needs a bareback rider won't give her no pain
A hard racy game of give and take
Leaves them dazed- half crazed - in her wake

'Kick it out - kick it out!' she said
'Kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive - kick it out!'
