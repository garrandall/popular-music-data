Oh, the boardwalk's deserted
There's nobody down by the shore
And the Ferris wheel ride
Isn't turning around anymore
The heat wave and the crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes

(Sand in my shoes)
Brings memories of the salty air
(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me (I've still got some sand in my shoes)
With the sand in my shoes

Oh, when the water was cold
You would tremble and hold me so tight
And we'd sit on the beach
Just to wait for the stars to come out at night
The heat wave and crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes

(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, brings memories of the salty air
(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me (I've still got some sand in my shoes)
With the sand in my shoes

(Sand in my shoes) Whoa
(Sand in my shoes) Whoa-la-la-la-la-oh
(Sand in my shoes) Whoa-oh
