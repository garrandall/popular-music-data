Yeah-ah
Oogie Mane he killed it
What're you talking about bro?
Turn it up
Turn it up (Wait)
I'm working on dying
Wait, yeah

Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Wrap)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, yeah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Woah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, yeah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap

Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a gnat
Just like his bitch ass
That fuck nigga will get clapped (Will get clapped)
Put a pause on that, you still broke, you ain't back (Yeah)

No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack

I can never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue
But my new coupe is slime green

My boys will work 'til the white turn all tan
Saw a minivan following my brand new Lamb'
I had an F and an N in my hand
All my bitches tens, no, I do not fuck no fans
Check my DM, found out she was a man (No, no, no)
I can't DM never ever again (No)
Losing all my vision, that's the only thing that's tran
Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted
I don't wanna know more, then I gotta clip it

Balmain jeans, on the front, got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July, cold just like December
It's too low in the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip (Yeah)

Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, I'ma go for the finish
Overseas, I'm eating croissants
Told that fuck nigga, "Don't touch my crumpet" (No)
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick

Went back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Bentley, Hellcat, new Lambo and Maybach
I can't talk on the phone, think my shit is tapped (Hello)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Wrap)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, Rackie)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fendi knapsack, boy I'm speaking Fendi facts (Facts)

I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (Nat, nat)
Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back
650 for a hat, 66,600 for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with them racks

Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Facts)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, facts)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, facts)
