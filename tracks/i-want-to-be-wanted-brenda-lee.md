(Wanted wanted)
Alone, so alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted (wanted)
Alone, watching lovers passing by
I want to be wanted

When I am kissed
I want his lips to really kiss me
When we're apart
I want his heart to really miss me
I want to know
He loves me so his eyes are misting
That's the way I want to be loved

Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted (wanted) right now
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted

I want someone
To share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know
I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me?

(Alone) Just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted (right now)
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted

I want someone
To share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know
I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me?
(Someone, somewhere) Meant for me
