We've been together now for such a long time
Through every trial we'd ever care to go
When I look back I almost can't believe it
We're not the same people that we used to know
With all the years behind me spent pretending
I didn't need someone like you around
It makes it even harder to imagine
The life I'd be livin', if I hadn't found
SOMEONE TO HOLD ME, THE WAY THAT YOU DO
SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ME, THE WAY I NEED YOU
SOMEONE TO SHOW ME, A WAY THAT IS TRUE
SOMEONE TO LOVE ME...THE WAY THAT I LOVE YOU
When there was no one left for me to turn to
When all the world I knew was fallin' down
Oh there were times I could not face the mornin'
But everything's changed since the day that I found

Come on-Come on-Come on-Come on now!
