You ask me if there'll come a time 
When I grow tired of you 
Never my love 
Never my love 

You wonder if this heart of mine 
Will lose its desire for you 
Never my love 
Never my love 

What makes you think love will end 
When you know that my whole life depends 
On you (on you) 

Never my love 
Never my love 

You say you fear I'll change my mind 
And I won't require you 
Never my love 
Never my love 

How can you think love will end 
When I've asked you to spend your whole life 
With me (with me, with me)
