I told this heart of mine
Our love could never be
But then I hear your voice
And something stirs inside of me

Somehow I can't dismiss
The memory of your kiss
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

No matter what I do
No matter what I say
No matter how I try
I just can't turn the other way

When I'm with someone new
I always think of you
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

You're not in love with me
So why can't I forget?
I'm just your "used-to-be"
It's wrong and yet

I know forgetting you
Would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I
Just can't seem to break the string

I say I'll let you go
But then my heart says no
Guess my heart has a mine of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
