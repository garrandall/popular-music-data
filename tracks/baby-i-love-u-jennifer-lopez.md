Boy, I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt
The way you were feeling me, baby
I'm so out of control, yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless, baby


What I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night? Oh


Baby, I love you (Love you)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, baby)
Can't be without you (Be without you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, baby)
Can't be without you


Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed, you're not the same
It's a new day


Oh, what I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye


Baby, I love you (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I need you (Gotta have you, baby)
I gotta have you (Can't be without you)
Can't be without you (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (I gotta have you)
I gotta have you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't be without you


Oh I love the way you kiss me
Oh, baby please, I'm about to lose my mind
Oh, talk to me, oh
'Cause I'm begging for you and I'm down on my knees
Baby, I know you're the one that I need
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you


(Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you, love you
(You know I need you)
Baby, I need you, I need you
(Gotta have you)
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
(Can't be without you)
Can't be without you, baby, I love you
(Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you, oh
(You know I need you)
Baby, I need you, oh, I swear I do
(Gotta have you)
I gotta have you, this no big love, babe
(Can't be without you)
Can't be without you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you
(You know I need you)
Baby, I need you, oh, woah
(Gotta have you)
I gotta have you, ladies, do you know what I'm talking about?
(Can't be without you)
Can't be without you, oh, woah
(Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you, when a man gets inside your soul
(You know I need you)
Baby, I need you, and it takes hold, and it won't let go
(Gotta have you)
I gotta have you
(Can't be without you)
Can't be without you, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
