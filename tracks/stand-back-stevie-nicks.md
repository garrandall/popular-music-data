No one looked
I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First he took my heart then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

(Stand back, stand back)
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

La, la, la-la, la, la, laaa, la-la
La, laaaa
La, la, la-la, laaaaa

Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
But one man did not call
He asked me for my love
And that was all

(Stand back, stand back)
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

La, la, la-la, la, la, laaa, la-la
La, laaaa
La, la, la-la, la, la, laaaaa
Too few, too few
Laaaaa
La, la, la-la, la, la, laaa, la-la
La, la, laaaa
La, la, la-la, laaaaaa

So I walked, walked down the line
Away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than I could do
One man did not fall
Well, he asked me for my love
That was all

(Stand back, stand back)
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I could cry
I need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy
Well, I need to be standing in
(Stand back)
Well, I need to be standing in
(Stand back)
Well, I need to be standing in
(Stand back)
Take me home
Take me home
(Stand back)
Don't you take me home
Well, I need a little sympathy
(Stand back)...
