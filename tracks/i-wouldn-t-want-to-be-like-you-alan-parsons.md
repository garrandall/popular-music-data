If I had a mind to
I wouldn't want to think like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you


I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you


If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was a fall guy
I wouldn't need no alibi...

Back on the bottom line
Diggin' for a lousy dime
If I hit a mother lode
I'd cover anything that showed

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't wanna

I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
