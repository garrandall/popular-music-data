If money grew on hackberry trees
If time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
That'd be alright
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
That'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright


Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
That'd be alright
If my dear old dog never got old
If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
That'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright


Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
That'd be alright
