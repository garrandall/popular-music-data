Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet
She's a real ball of fire
She's a gas, man, can't be beat

She wins all the contests
Down in Philly, PA
She's the number one
Dancer in the USA

That's Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet

Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet
Has a little bit of rhythm that was
Brought up on a swinging street

When the band starts playing
She never stops
Don't you know she's the
Queen of the record hop

That's Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet

Wow, Patty

Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet
She's the kind of girl
All the guys say they want to meet

From New York City down to Idaho
You'll see Patty baby
Wherever you go

That's Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet

Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet
Ow, that's Patty baby
The girl with the dancing feet
