Driven out by thieves,
I watch them pillage the planet
Fueled by a fattening greed,
Trees fall to the hatchet

We're chopping against the grain,
Our spirits in a vacuum
Sadly ignore the pain,
The end arrives, we all lose
We all lose, I hope it comes, it comes, it comes around

Driven out
Holding out
Day by day survival
Castaways have silent lives
With the strength to rival you

See now I'm driving in my car
I used to be able to walk this far
Now I turn on the light
I used to be able to sleep at night

I'm cooking with microwaves
To warm up food that's not seen the soil
Plugged into my TV
I'm used to the lies they're telling me
I hope it comes, it comes, it comes around

Driven out
Holding out
Day by day survival
Castaways have silent lives
With the strength to rival you

Driven out
Holding out
Driven out
Holding out
With the strength to rival you

I'm hoping that we find,
More to life than meets the eye
Can we escape the grind,
Build a life that's more worthwhile
Rid of this empty pride,
Full of selfishness inside
Bathe in a turning tide,
Until then we all hide
We all hide
I hope it comes, it comes, it comes around

Driven out
Holding out
Day by day survival
Castaways have silent lives
With the strength to rival...

Driven out
Holding out
Could take up your best time
Driven out
Holding out
With the strength to rival you
Rival you
Rival...
