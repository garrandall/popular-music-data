"baby, I see you packing
But it's no surprise for me
You see, I knew it was coming for a long time
Say what ? no, no I won't cry
You see i'm a big girl now, and I just can't cry no more
But there's something I want you to know:
That I love you, I love you, I love you!
And there's one more thing I want you to know:
That if you ever need a friend
You can count on me
And honey:"
If you're falling down
And you can't seem to stay on the ground
And when friends get few
I'll be there to get you up
And if she puts you down
I'll be around, so don't be afraid
Cause i'll be there to get you up
And if it steal the smiles, rain and shine
If you're sad or glad, happy or bad
You can cry to me (cry to me)
Cry to me (cry to me)
No matter how harder things got to be
You can cry to me
Cry cry cry cry to me
Now I know I must sound
Just like a fool man love
But I can't help myself really comes to loving you baby
And I know you said
That our love was true
But if it "don't" work out
Honey here's what I want you to do
Drown my number
Knock on the door
Write me a letter
But just let me know
Cause you can cry to me (cry to me)
Honey cry to me (cry to me)
No matter how harder things got to be
You can cry to me (cry to me)
Oh yes you can cry, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh baby, oh baby how i'm gonna miss you ...
Cause we've been together for so long
But I know it's gonna be hard to live without you
But I want you to know that
When times get harder you can drown my number
Knock on my door
Honey send me a telegram
But just let, just let me know
You can cry to me (cry to me)
No matter how harder things got to be
Cry to me (cry to me)
You can cry to me
Oh baby, oh baby
It's been so good, it's been really good
I hope you feel the same way I do
I hope that you feel that it's been good too
