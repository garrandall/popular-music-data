All our love, peace, and happiness
We're gonna give to you now
All our love, peace, and happiness
And you can share yours too

All our love, peace, and happiness
We're gonna give to you, yeah
All our love, peace, and happiness
You can share yours too

It's a small step for man
But it's a giant leap
For all mankind

I got love, I got peace
I got happiness and
You can have it too, yeah

Together, we stand
Divided, we fall
Love, peace, and happiness
Is the best part of all

Oh, love, peace, and happiness
Oh, love, peace, and happiness
Oh, love, peace, and happiness
Oh, love, peace, and happiness
