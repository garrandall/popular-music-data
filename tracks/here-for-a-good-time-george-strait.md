I'm not gonna lay around and whine and moan
'Cause somebody done done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I'm gonna sit around
And sing some old sad song

I believe it's half-full not a half-empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine
To hell with the red wine
Pour me some moon shine

When I'm gone
Put it in stone
"He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

Folks are always dreaming 'bout
What they'd like to do
But I like to do just what I like
I'll take the chance
Dance the dance
It might be wrong
But then again it might be right

There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it
I say, "Bring on anything."

I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine
To hell with the red wine
Pour me some moon shine

When I'm gone
Put it in stone
"He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
