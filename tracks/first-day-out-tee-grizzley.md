Free my nigga J Real man
FGE shit, Rap God
Finna kill 4 remixes in one day
First remix since a nigga been home from jail

Got money in two different cities I was selling packs
Three pistol cases even 12 know that I never lack
Yo FGE! Ain't it a blessing?
We put God first 'stead of complaining and stressing
How we came up from nothing hustlin' now we fly like the Jetsons
Ain't it a blessing that we're free and stealing each other presents?
Yo G-O-D, thanks for the blessing
When 12 searched us and found that Smith & Wesson
They locked us up and asked us questions
Tried to change the direction
My niggas didn't let 'em finess 'em for a fuckin' confession

Kick doors in my Timbos, uppin' big poles
Get smacked with the pistol, leave your shit swole
Fall back nigga limbo if it ain't ten-fold
Pop that pussy like a nympho or a pimp hoe
Still reminiscing on them days when I was broke as hell
Till I set grams up on the scale yeah I had dro for sale
Didn't get high off my supply so I was smoking L's
I had shit planned I never thought that I would go to jail
Be reading books and doing push-ups in a holding cell
Had CO's bringing me bundles of all my open mail
I know the system's against us and we supposed to fail
The white walkers amongst us youngers is cold as hell
They came to my block I was plottin' bitch I was loading shells
Brought toys to school inside my bookbag it wasn't show and tell
You niggas hate 'cause I'm speaking facts and I'm dope as hell
You should've seen them crackers faces when I posted bail
Been fighting demons all my life I swear I know 'em well
I'll take your life then act surprised if I do go to jail
Came from a portal, Rap God I'm immortal
Tats on my torso got cheese like Digiorno
Pockets like bolo, horse on me no polo
I roll up no yo-yo then cut like I'm Zoro
This monster is armed that's on foenem no Goro
Leave pussy wet watch me do it no porno
Tony always beast and you niggas know that's themode he in
Trippin' splashing sauce on your TV like Nickelodeon
Ballin' like I'm Kobe and Mike on 'em like a podium
Broski blowin loud like a dynamite no Napoleon
Foreign thing, all on my dick, shawty Cambodian
Don't slip I'll come with that mop, like a custodian
When I show up niggas shut up they don't know what he on
His homie played them games with me and now his buddy gone
They wanna stand by your side when they know your money long
Now watch how many disappear when you tell 'em your money gone
Niggas been praying on my downfall
Don't cross that line like a foul ball
I might have to let a hundred rounds off
AK-47 with me it'll kill a clown y'all
Wet 'em and dead 'em before I let 'em take my crown off
Dreams of killin' 12 turn a pig to a groundhog
Too fuckin high and godly to ever be around y'all
Flow so deep, go over heads I could drown y'all
New fans searching for my tracks like a hound dog
Didn't have a penny but I done made my family proud y'all

Squaaaa
Shout out to the home Tee Grizzley too man, keep doing your thing man much love
And shout out to my squad FGE shit man you already know what it is man Rap God
