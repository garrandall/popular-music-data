You're keeping in step 
In the line 
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine 
Cause you do 
What you're told 
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold 

Just how deep do you believe? 
Will you bite the hand that feeds? 
Will you chew until it bleeds? 
Can you get up off your knees? 
Are you brave enough to see? 
Do you want to change it?

What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
On which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you want to change it?

So naive
I keep holding on to what I want to believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on


Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
