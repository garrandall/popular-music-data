Well I wonder what it's like to be a rainmaker
I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain
I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on every one
You can come and see them when I'm ... done
When I'm done

I wonder what it's like to be a superhero
I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown, yeah
From some other planet, I'd get this funky high on a yellow sun
Boy, I bet my friends will all be ... stunned
They're stunned

Yeah!

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here?
If I was someone else would it all fall apart?
Strange, where were you when we started this gig?
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

Do you?
Do you?
And me

Well I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho
I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I said (just what I said)
Well I'd shout out an order "I think we're out of this, man, get me some
Boy, don't make me want to change my tone
My tone

Yeah!

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here?
If I was someone else would it all fall apart?
Strange, where were you when we started this gig?
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

Please don't change
Please don't break
Well the only thing that seems to work at all is you
Please don't change at all
For me to you
And you to me, yeah

Yeah!

Straight up, what did you want to learn about here?
If I was someone else would this all just fall apart?
Strange, where were you when we started this gig?
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

I wish the real world would just stop hassling me
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

To you and me
