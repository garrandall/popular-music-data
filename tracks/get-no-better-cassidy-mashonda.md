Me and you (it don't get no better) what we can do (it don't get no better) our love

Hey you know what you remind me of the sun that shines above I think that I'm in
Love cause every time I look in your eyes they be dumb bright like the sunlight when I look in
The sky and you always look fly, you stay with a mean outfit and got shoes that they didn't even come out yet.
Always got your your nails done, always got yourself fixed you the type of chick I
Can see me going out wit and I ain't knocking yo hustle but you should be somebody's wifey icey
Wit a rock on your knuckle and we would look hot as a couple cause you shaped so beautifully and
You almost as cute as me.




Mmmm wit yo sexy self go to my hotel and undress yourself and after we have sex
Don't stress yourself I will respect you if you respect yourself girl it's whatever I get the
Chedda when we get together it don't be no better and you can see I'm throwin' it cause my arm
On chill it look like i spilled freon on it.
I make hella paper on the block that's why I'm bout
To put a three story elevator in my yacht they going keep hating it boo, but keep holdin' me
Down strong dis song dedicated to you.




Baby I can't deny that I'm feeling you, the way that you look and the things you do.
Knowing, knowing baby it don't whoa oh whoa it don't get no better



I go by the name of Cassidy "da problem", me and mashonda
