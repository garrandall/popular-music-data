See I've been watching you for a while your smile and stuff
and I don't know if I can be with you for tonight alright,
is that alright baby, baby


There is only one for me
You have made that a possibility
We could take that step to see, oh
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes


All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so


Loving you has taken time, taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognize the butterflies inside me
Sense is gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes
