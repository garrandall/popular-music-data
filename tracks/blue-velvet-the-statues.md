She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From her eyes

She wore blue velvet
And as the night danced slowly by
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love we held tightly
Feeling this rapturous glow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she's gone
Gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
And in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years

And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears
(I can still see blue velvet through my tears)
