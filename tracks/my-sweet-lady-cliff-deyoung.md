Lady, are you crying
Do the tears belong to me
Do you think our time together
Is all gone

Lady, you've been dreaming
I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you
Our time has just begun

Close your eyes
And rest your weary mind
I promise I'll stay
Right here beside you

Today our lives were joined
Became entwined
And I wish that you could
Know how much I love you

Oh, oh, my lady, are you crying
Do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together
Is all gone

Lady, my sweet lady
I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you
Our time has just begun
