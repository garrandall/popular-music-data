Well my wave length gets a little longer,
Every time I wave goodbye,
Sentimental break down,
You know I break down and lie,
Where I'm not supposed to lie my head,
Always seems my softest pillow.

And as I board my plane,
Something inside my brain,
Hates to wave L.A. goodbye,
L.A. goodbye, goodbye,
L.A. I'm gonna see you 'round sometime,
L.A. goodbye,
L.A. I'm gonna be a 'round sometime,
L.A. goodbye.

Sunset strip and a field trip,
Over to your hide away,
Sunset Princess beckons and,
We love the night away,
Now I feel light years away,
From the west side of Chicago.

And as I board my plane,
Something inside my brain,
Hates to wave L.A. Goodbye,
L.A. goodbye, goodbye,
L.A. wouldn't see you around now,
L.A. goodbye,
Can't you see the tear in my eye now,
L.A. goodbye,
L.A. stop to cry now,
L.A. goodbye I'm going to see you around.
