It was Saturday nite,
the moon was bright
Shining down, it's harvest light
Music all around to hear, set the stage
And atmosphere-many dress to suit
Their taste, participate in the ego race
Tonite's the night, for you to be
Biggest man in history

Saturday nite's your curtain call
You found your place after all
I saw a face in the crowd
Sayin' nothin', yet talking loud

Life is just a day
Living games we play
London Bridge is fallin' down
Do what Simon says
Doing what you feel,
Games can be unreal
Humpty-Dumpty when you fall
There be no one here to call
Life is stil your mystery
You see, you see, you see

Many friends, who gather 'round
In hope, to feel safe and sound
We emphasize, to make it clear
Our stumbling nations atmosphere
While looking thru the looking glass
Our vision show, a stormy past
When you gonna wake, and see the sun-
Stop wasting time and having fun

Life is just a day
Daily games we play
London Bridge has fallen down
You did what Simon said
Doing what you feel
Games are so unreal
Humpty-Dumpty why'd you fall
You see there's no one here to call
Now we've solved this mystery
You see, you see, you see
