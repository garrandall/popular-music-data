Dime porque
Tell me why
Que ha pensando
You need to tell me what you're thinking

I can see it in your eyes
Every tear, every cry
Something's telling me
That maybe it's not the same

Oh, you can tell me, it's all right
Everything will be fine
But if my heart doesn't know it
If you can't show it
You're giving me the notion

That we're going
Through the motions of love
If you're going through the motions
Listen to me, if you really love me
You've got to do more than try
If you're going through the motions

If you really love me
You've got to do much more than try
Kick it to 'em, frost

Give you something going home
Let's try to be strong
There isn't anything
That we can't get by

Oh, I'm not playing games
Baby, I'll take the blame
Cause if it's me you're decieving
This heart's not believing and
You're only giving me the notion

Do you understand what I'm saying
Just chill

Please don't tell me I don't love you, lady
Please don't tell me I don't care
All I know, all I know is
That I need you, baby
Loving you, wanting you
I need you always to be there

Break it down, break it down
This is the situation
I cannot read your mind
If there's a problem, come to me
I know we can work it out

If you're going through the motions of love
If you're going through the motions
Listen to me, if you really love me
You've got to do more than try, try, try
If you're going through the motions
Going through the motions, girl

If you're going through the motions
Love, love, love, love, love, love
If you're going through the motions
If you really love me
You've got to do more than try
If you're going through the motions
Everybody, everybody

If you're going through the motions of love
If you're going through the motions
Through the motions, if you really love me
You've got to do more than try
If you're going through the motions
If you know what I'm talking 'bout, baby
Sing it

Oh, oh, oh
Don't keep going through the motions
Tell me again

Through the motions
If you really love me
You've got to do more than
Got to do, got to do more than
Got to do, got to do more than
Try, try, try, try...
