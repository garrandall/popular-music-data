Me and Kurt feel the same
Too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain
All I do is complain
She needs something to change
Need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (say)

I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

We're both actin' insane
But too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again
80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained
Looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

I want you out of my head (head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes


I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive
It got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV?
I'm watchin' a fight
I flood the garage
Blue diamond, no shark
Your Barbie life doll
Is Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive
Your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side (yeah)
The one that's unbothered
And I don't want you to never go outside (outside)
I promise if they play, my nigga slidin' (slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I want you out of my head (out of my head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm no good at goodbyes
