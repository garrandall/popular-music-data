Do you remember the nights we
Stayed up, just laughing
Smiling for hours at anything?
Remember the nights we
Drove around crazy in love?


When the lights go out
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream


Do you remember the nights we
Made our way dreaming
Hoping of being someone big?
We were so young then
We were too crazy in love





When the lights go out
(And when the lights go out)
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream
