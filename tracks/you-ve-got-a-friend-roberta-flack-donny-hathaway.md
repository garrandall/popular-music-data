Woo, hoo, hoo
Woo, hoo, hoo

When you're down and troubled
And you need some lovin' care
And nothing, nothing is goin' right

Hm, close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know
That you got a friend
People can be so cold

They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, running, running
To see you again

Look out, hey
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
(I'll be there)
You've got a friend

Say it again, woo, hoo
You've got a friend
You got a friend, indeed
You got a friend, you got
You got a friend, oh darling

You got a friend, do you need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got a friend
You got a friend
