Everybody has something they have to leave behind
One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time
There's no use look'in back or wonder'n
How it could be now or mighta been
Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go


I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that ive moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you

Somewhere in my memory I lost all sense of time

Soon my road can never be 'cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use look'in back or wonderin
How it could now or mighta been
Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go



You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will you know you will o baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use lookin back or wonderin
'cause love is a strange and funny thing
No matter how I try and try I just can't say goodbye
No no no no no
