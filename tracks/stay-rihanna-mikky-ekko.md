All along it was a fever
A cold-sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay


It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
Yeah, it takes me all the way
I want you to stay


Oh, oh oohthe reason I hold on
Oh, oh oohcause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving


Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move


Makes me feel like I can't live without you
Yeah, it takes me all the way


I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh
