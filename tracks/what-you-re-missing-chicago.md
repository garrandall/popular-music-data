All we wanted was each other
Nothing more
You were looking for an answer
You were out the door
I didn't know what you were after
I knew you had to take a chance, girl
Did you forget about the laughter?
Say oh, oh no


Oh, what you're missing could have been yours from the start
You won't listen when it's coming from the heart
Now you're missing me
You'll find that out when we're apart


Had some crazy conversations
You know they seemed so right
Remember how it used to keep us up all night?
I didn't know what you were after
Maybe there never was an answer
Did you forget about the laughter?
Say oh, oh no
