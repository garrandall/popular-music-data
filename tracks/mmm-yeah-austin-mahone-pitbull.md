Austin M keep doing your thing
Let these boys keep slipping man
I'm not into gymnastics but I'm into flipping things

I told these women that it's all about a team,
Jordan and Pippen man
So do you wanna join the team
Now tell me little miss thang
DalÃ©!


When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I ask her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was


Rock'n'roll one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it cause I mean what I say say say say
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walks past me I say hey, hey, heyâ¦

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walk pass me like I ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place
Like man

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I ask her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Six inch heels clicking up down the street
You know she's coming and then she walks away way way way
I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I say say say say say

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walk pass me like I ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place
Like man

When I saw her (saw her)
Walking down the street (down the street)
She looked so fine (so fine)
I just had to speak (yeah)

I ask her name (what's your name?)
But she turned away (hey!)
As she walked
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
She look so good but she bad bad
You can see that back from the front front
Booty like Kriss Kross, jump jump
Meet me in the middle of the ocean
We can find ourselves and lose our minds, rewind
Wawawawa, play
Find ourselves and lose our minds today
Austin M. and Armando acabando latinos y gringos gozando me entiendes
For those that thought that we would stop
Definitely don't have a mind to think with, brainless
Most of them broke but they famous
Some got hits but they nameless
But mamita, forget about that
When I see you
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was
