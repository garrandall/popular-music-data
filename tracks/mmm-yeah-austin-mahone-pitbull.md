Austin M, keep doing your thing
Let these boys keep slippin', man
I'm not into gymnastics
But I'm into flippin' things
I tell these women that it's all about a team
Jordan and Pippen, man
So do you want join the team?
Now tell me, Little Miss Thang, Dal√©


When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak
I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was


Rock and roll one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it cause I mean what I say, say, say, say
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walks past me I say "hey, hey, hey"


So tell me where you from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl, I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place, like, man


When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak
I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was


6 inch heels clicking up-down the street
You know she's coming and then she walks
Away-way-way-way
Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I say, say, say, say, say


So tell me where you from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl, I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place, like, man


When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak
I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
She look so good, but she bad, bad
You can see that back from the front, front
Booty like Kris Kross, jump, jump
Meet me in the middle of the ocean, we can
Find ourselves and lose our minds, rewind
Wawawawa, play
Find ourselves and lose our minds today
Austin M. and Armando acabando
Latinos y gringos gozando me entiendes
For those that thought that we would stop
Definitely don't have a mind to think with, brainless
Most of them broke, but they famous
Some got hits, but they nameless
But, Mamita, forget about that
When I seen you (all that I could say was)


Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
