I wanna try something, all night
I wanna try something, all night

Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I prolly should wait, but I wanna letcha go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

The way you looking tonight (tonight)
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at 2
I'll still be moving witchu
You ain't looking at nobody
Just my body

Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I prolly should wait, but I wanna letcha go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

Ah oh, ah, I wanna try baby
Ah oh, all night
Ah, babe


Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby

I feel the same, yeah yeah
Taste your lips girl when we kiss
Why don't we handle this?
Girl you know I need some affection, yeah yeah


Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I prolly should wait, but I wanna letcha go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something


Ah oh, ah, I wanna try baby
Ah oh, all night
Ah, babe


This ain't forever baby, just tonight
Just sit back and take my direction yeah

Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I prolly should wait, but I wanna letcha go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night

Ah oh, ah, I wanna try baby
