Kick it
K-k-k-k-kick it

You woke up late for school, man you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes with no homework
Your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk, yeah

So we gotta fight for the right to party
Yeah, dig it
Now we gotta fight for the right to party

Over here
Yeah
Ow, ow, ow
Bring it down, bring it down, yeah
Come on, dig it

(We gotta special gues here tonight, one time only
Bling, Bling is in the house!)

Well, your pop caught you smoking, man he said, "No way!"
Man, that hypocrite, she smokes two packs a day
Well, living at that home is such a drag
My old lady threw away my best porno mag

Busted!

You gotta fight for the right to party
Wooh, party
Yeah, now we gotta party, ow
Hey, hey, hey, party
Yeah, let's go

Yeah
Yeah
Hey, hey
Yeah, wooh

Yeah, just like that
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Busted!
