Kick it!


You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom "Please?", but she still says "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk


You gotta fight for your right to party


Your pop caught you smoking, and he said: "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)


You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, â€œWhat's that noise?"
Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys


You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party


Parrrrrrty
Parrrrrrty
Yeah!
