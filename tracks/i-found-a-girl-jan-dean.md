I, I found a girl
Anybody can see just by looking at me
That I found a girl

Sun that never shined
Is shinin' tonight, I'm feelin' groovy tonight
'Cause I found a girl

I used to go to parties all alone
But now I can't see how
I lived a life of misery
But things are different now

'Cause I, I found a girl
Who coincidentally just happens to be
In love with me

Stars that never shined
Is shinin' tonight, I'm feelin' groovy tonight
'Cause I found a girl

I used to go to parties all alone
But now I can't see how
I lived a life of misery
But things are different now

'Cause I, I found a girl
Who coincidentally just happens to be
In love with me
