Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown


Hot and cold
Bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold yeah
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might
Wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you'e left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown


Oh, nothing
Oh, where's your crown?

I wish I may
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it
Careful what you wish
You just might get it


Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?


Nothing
No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to never never land
