I've searched and I've searched
Oh, but I just couldn't find
No way on Earth
To gain peace of mind

You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I she'd were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord
(I am happy with the Lord)

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

Oh, I've searched (I've searched)
And I've searched (I've searched)
Oh, but I just couldn't find
No way on Earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
He will make your burden lighter
And you'll surely find a way
(And you'll surely find a way)
