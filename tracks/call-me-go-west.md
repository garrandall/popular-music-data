Face to face
My reflection in your eyes
I was scared to say too much
Perfect strangers in perfect worlds apart
Almost close enough to touch
Staring at my shoes
Feeling so confused
Shot down without a gun
Victim of a hit and run
Won't you...

Call me - call me
No time to hesitate - we must communicate
Call me - call me
Won't you call this number now

Mesmerised
I go back to where we met
A reconstruction of the crime
I can't track you down
Nowhere to be found
Now my one shot at success
Is the power of the press
Won't you...

Call me - call me
No time to hesitate - we must communicate
Call me - call me
Won't you call this number now

Worlds apart - we are worlds apart

Watch this space
There's a message here for you
No need to read between the lines
I am inside out
There can be no doubt
I want you and no-one else
Please identify yourself

Call me - call me
No time to hesitate - we must communicate
Call me - call me
Won't you call this number now
Call me - call me
I'll be waiting here for you - I don't know what else to do
Call me - call me
Won't you call this number now (girl, won't you call me)
Call me - call me
