Your pillow wasn't slept upon
Your closet was empty, too
All of your shirts and ties were gone
There wasn't a trace of you
How could you go and leave so completely?
Nothing was left
Of all the memories that we used to share
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half-filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair

At least you could have said goodbye
You shouldn't have to run away
Were you afraid that I would cry?
My tears might have made you stay
Gone are the dreams that kept us together
Nothing was left
To show that we were once so happy then
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half-filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair

How could you go and leave so completely?
Nothing was left
Of all the memories that we used to share
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half-filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
