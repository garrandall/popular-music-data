Boy, so what's been on your mind?
For me, it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright
'Cause here, we get to take our time
You, you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright

I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So are you ready, baby?

You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
And then I'm like, oh, your love
My my my my my
And then I'm like, oh, yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

After that, when you catch your breath
You look at me and say
Love, are you real?
Just don't pretend you're just a friend, babe

I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So are you ready, baby?

You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
And then I'm like, oh, your love
My my my my my
And then I'm like, oh, yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

Just don't pretend you're just a friend (just a friend)
Don't pretend you're just a friend (just a friend)
Don't pretend you're just a friend (just a friend)
Don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
You got me screaming
My my my ma-ma my my
And then I'm like, oh, your love
My my my my my
And then I'm like, oh, yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore, babe
