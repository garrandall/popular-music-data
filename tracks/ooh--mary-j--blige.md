In the middle of the night, you hold me tight
Said it's alright, I'm yours forever
I do what you want, if you don't hurt me
I'll cook and clean, I'll make you happy


Oh, what you do to me
(What you do to me)
Oh, you're my everything
(You're my everything)
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad I found you)
Oh, I can't live without you


Got a jones in my bones, and it's all for you, babe
Can't leave you alone, I'm so addicted
I can't shake thang, it's the sweetest pain
So who's your girl? You better say my name


Oh, what you do to me
(What you do to me, baby baby baby)
Oh, you're my everything
(You're my every, everything)
And oh, I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad I found you, yeah)
Oh, I can't live without you


What you do to me, it's just a mystery
It's hard to believe, that you are here with me
Making all my dreams a sweet reality
All my life I tried to find what's best for me
It's you


Oh, what you do to me
(What you do to me, baby baby)
Oh you're my everything
(You're my everything)
Oh I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad I found you, baby)
Oh I can't live without you
(What you do to me, baby)
Oh, what you do to me
Oh, you're my everything
(You're my everything, everything)
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
Oh, I can't live without you
(I can't live without you)
Oh, what you do to me
(What you do to me, baby baby)
Oh, you're my everything
(You're my everything)
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad that I found you)
Oh, I can't live without you


What you do to me it's just a mystery
It's hard to believe that you are here with me
Making all my dreams a sweet reality
(You made all my dreams, made 'em all come true)
All my life I tried to find what's best for me
It's you


Oh, what you do to me
(What you do to me)
Oh, you're my everything
(Everything, baby)
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad I found you)
Oh, I can't live without you
(I can't live, I can't live without you)
Oh, what you do to me
Oh, you're my everything
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
(I'm so glad I found you)
Oh, I can't live without you
