She was mine only yesterday
Both our hearts beat as one
But then I felt her slip away
As a cloud stole the sun

And the he-e-e-avens cri-i-i-ied...

And the tears filled the stre-e-e-am...
And the stream filled the river
The river filled the sea
All because, she took her love
Away from me-e-e-e-e...
Though each dawn brings the sun again

Yesterday will remain
Every day I'll remember when
All the clouds filled with rain
And the heavens crieeeed...

And the tears filled the streaaaaaam...
And the stream filled the river
The river filled the sea
All because, she tock her love
Away from meeee... eee...!
