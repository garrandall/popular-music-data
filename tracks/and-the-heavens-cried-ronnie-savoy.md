She was mine only yesterday
Both our hearts beat as one
But then I felt her slip away
As a cloud stole the sun

And the heavens cried

And the tears filled the stream
And the stream filled the river
The river filled the sea
All because, she took her love
Away from me
Though each dawn brings the sun again

Yesterday will remain
Every day I'll remember when
All the clouds filled with rain
And the heavens cried

And the tears filled the stream
And the stream filled the river
The river filled the sea
All because, she tock her love
Away from me
