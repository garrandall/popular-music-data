On heavenly rain, you fell into my life
Unforgettable smile, unforgettable lies
In the name of the cross or a banner of love
With a hand of a friend or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

We're going to set fire to the house in my heart
We're going to set fire to the whole damn world
I don't understand the wicked things we do
In the name of the good, in the name of the few

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes
The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

Don't look up at me with your innocent smile
When the bed is burning around my head
When a war breaks out, it'll be no surprise
Your unforgettable smile, your unforgettable lies

And I've gotta start running to make my start
We've gotta get together before we fall apart

They're pulling down the old slums to build the new
They're bringing back the old rules to please the few
In the name of the cross or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

They're pulling down the old slums to build the new
Pull down the love I built with you
Promise of tomorrow you never kept
And you tried to burn the house down when I slept
The nation's in disorder, there's chaos in my heart
We've got to get together before we fall apart

Before we fall apart
Before we fall apart
Before we fall apart
Before we fall apart
