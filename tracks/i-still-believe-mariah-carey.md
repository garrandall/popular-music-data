You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed


I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again


Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, oh oh I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together woah oh no, no, no, oh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again ummm
Oh woah, oh hoh, oh hoh


I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again (oh baby, yeah yeah)
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah
I still believe (Oh baby, I do)
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)
In love again, yeah
I had a dream (I missed your love)
Someday you and me (uhm, uhm)
Will find ourselves in love again (ah, yah, yah, yah, ah)
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
