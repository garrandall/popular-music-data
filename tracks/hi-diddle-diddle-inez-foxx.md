Hi Diddle Diddle
Hi Diddle Diddle
Hi Diddle Diddle
Ha ha Diddle Diddle

Hi diddle diddle
Cats in the middle (cats in the middle)
And the cow jumped over the moon
And me and my baby were on a hayride yes we were


It happened one night when the stars were bright
And I was lookin good in my tight blue jeans
I remember that night when I looked around for my baby and I
Thought he had split the scene

I started asking around for my baby
When I saw his red shit from under the hay
And by that time somebody whispered in my ear
That he was kissin Annie Mae

And I, I said to myself, Inez baby don't blow your cool
'Cause if you do you'll end up in a fool 
But to my surprise I couldn't keep cool and I just 

That's when, that's when I kicked the hay up and
He jumped up with the evidence all over his face yes it was
I said to ... But no more this lovin you'll ever get

Hi Diddle Diddle
Hi Diddle Diddle
Hi Diddle Diddle
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Hi diddle diddle
Cats in the middle (cats in the middle)
And the cow jumped over the moon
And me and my baby were on a hayride yes we were
