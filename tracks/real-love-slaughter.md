I lie awake in the morning light
No one to hold
Another sleepless night
'Cause it's over now that you've left me
Oh so lonely
Oh, I hear it calling
Oh, I hear it calling
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love isn't anyone true anymore
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love where are you
All through my lifei've been feelin' down
Searchin' to find
I'm lost and not found
There's gotta be someone
Someone who understands me
Oh, I hear it calling
Oh, I hear it calling
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love isn't anyone true anymore
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love where are you
Oh, I hear it calling
Oh, can't you hear it calling
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love isn't anyone true anymore
Real love won't somebody show me
Real love where are you
