Gotta get it, got to, got to, get money
Gotta get it, got to, got to, get paid
I need money
Money is the thing that i need
To ful fil my greed
Marky Mark would like 2 say

That im fiending, just 2 get paid
Forget love and all that crap
Im just tryin 2 keep my pockets fat
I need Cash in a hurry and it just aint funny
Yo... I need money!

I need some money
I need money (R2)

Well its friday nite and im calling up my honey
Bitch better have my money!
Word! cuz times are hard
I lost my job, my wallet, my friends and my credit card
My brothers a millionare and he dont even share
For all he cares i could be on the welfare
I need cash in a hurry and it just aint funny
I need money

CHORUS
I Need money, yeah thats my situation
So right a check cuz im takin donations
Or handouts, It dont matter
As long As my pockets get fatter & fatter & fatter
Cuz im hungry for the green backs
For a dollar I'll even sell big macs
Thats right cuz brother i found
That money makes the world go round
Dont care what you people say
I just wanna get Paid!
U call me greedy but u know its true
That u want money too!
I need. u know what i need
I need. u know what i need
We all need

CHORUS
