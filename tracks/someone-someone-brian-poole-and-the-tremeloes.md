Someone (love you), Someone (love you), Someone who really love you
(Someone) when Someone really loves you (Someone) that's when your life begins
Once I was loved by no one, no one depended on me
I thought that I was truly happy, but oh how wrong can you be
Someone (love you), Someone (love you), Someone who really love you
(Someone) when Someone really loves you (Someone) that's when your life begins
A heart can be easily broken, a heart can even stand still
A heart can be easily broken, but I know that mine never will
Once all the stars where shining, now its so easy to see
Once all the stars were shining, but now they are shining for me
Someone (love you), Someone (love you), Someone who really love you
(Someone) when Someone really loves you (Someone) that's when your life begins
That's when your life begin
That's when your life begin
