They said it was impossible
For these arms of mine to hold you
That one fine day
He'd up and leave me flat
But ha, ha, ha
I got the last laugh baby
How about that
The impossible happen
The impossible happen

They said it was impossible
When one love to made you happy
You'd bounce around
Just like an acrobat
But ho, ho, ho
I got the last laugh baby
How about that
The impossible happen
The impossible happen

They told me not to open my arms but I did
They told me not to give you my lips but I did
They said the only thing you do is take, take, take
To give you my love would be my greatest mistake

They said it was impossible
For those wedding bells to ding dong
Oh no, they said you'd never go for that
But ha, ha, ha
I got the last laugh baby
How about that
The impossible happen
The impossible happen

They told me not to open my arms but I did
They told me not to give you my lips but I did
They said the only thing you'd do is take, take, take
To give you my love would be my greatest mistake

They said it was impossible
For those wedding bells to ding dong
Oh no, they said you'd never go for that
But ha, ha, ha
I got the last laugh baby
How about that
The impossible happen
The impossible happen.
