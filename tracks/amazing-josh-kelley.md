You paint a picture on the wall
Cause you've got a lot to tell me
But you don't think you could say it better oh baby

You're bringing up times I can't recall
And I'm sure they made your point
But I just can't seem to remember yeah

And I know you've got the feeling
And I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons
And the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination


So come on let me see
I say baby you are amazing
I want to let you see
That you are everything and more to me
I will let you be I will I will

Cause I saw you walking down the hall
And I had a lot to tell you
But I didn't think you could say it better oh baby

You're good at makin me feel so small
And I know you made your point
But I just don't want to remember yeah

And I know you've got the feelin
And I can't say I'm agreein with your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons
And the hints that I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination



Cause I'm dancing around
In your world of play
I'm takin my time to make sure you stay
I would give my life to make it okay yeah

So come on let me see...
