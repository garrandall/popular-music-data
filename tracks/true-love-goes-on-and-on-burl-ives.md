True love goes on and on
My darling, I'll always love you

The white snow of Christmas will melt away
The darkness of evening will end the day
And time will wither the strongest tree
But nothing will change you and me

For true love goes on and on
Our love will be ever new
True love goes on and on
My darling, I'll always love you

The mightiest mountain may tumble down
The world may even stop spinning round
A star may fall to the deep blue sea
But nothing will change you and me

For true love goes on and on
Our love will be ever new
True love goes on and on
My darling, I'll always love you

Some days the sun will forget to shine
In autumn, the leaves will desert the vine
An ocean may someday a desert be
But nothing will change you and me

For true love goes on and on
Our love will be ever new
True love goes on and on
My darling, I'll always love you
