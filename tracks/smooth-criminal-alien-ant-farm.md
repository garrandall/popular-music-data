Ten somersets will undertake on solid ground
The Beatles were my thing Supertramp Jackson Browne
Maybe I threw on The Police or ELO to take me home
And every time I listened to The Pixies with you
Purple rain falls on the dark side of the moon
Maybe I'll take this journey through Zooropa with U2

They helped me through
With rhythm and blues, my country too
They watched me grow
With rock and roll, with heart and soul

And they were singing my life with every line
Pulling my strings every time
Even through my torment we share this moment
Through the ups and the downs, the lows and the highs
We'll never forget, you opened our eyes
Even though I don't know you, I feel like I owe you

Phil Collins on the record player spinning round
It's In The Air Tonight, I feel good James Brown
And maybe Queen will headline like a Smooth Criminal
Sade all day, McKnight all night
Kiss is here to party, Beasties fight for your right
The Stones will keep us rolling with The Eagles we can fly

They helped me through
With rhythm and blues, my country too
They watched me grow
With rock and roll, with heart and soul

And they were singing my life with every line
Pulling my strings every time
Even through my torment we share this moment
Through the ups and the downs, the lows and the highs
We'll never forget, you opened our eyes
Even though I don't know you, I feel like I owe you

I got Joni Mitchell when I need a soul sister
And I got Keith Richards when I'm low
I got Stevie Wonder with you underneath my covers
And I got Otis Redding for the love

And they were singing my life with every line
Pulling my strings every time
Even through my torment we share this moment
Through the ups and the downs, the lows and the highs
We'll never forget, you opened our eyes
Even though I don't know you, I feel like I owe you

Even though I don't know you, I feel like I owe you
I feel like I owe you, yeah

I got Stevie Wonder with you underneath my covers
And I got Otis Redding for the love
