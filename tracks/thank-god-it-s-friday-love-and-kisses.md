We sit alone in the darkest corner
Waitress comes and takes our order
And looks at us so suspiciously
It's plain to see that we're lovers
Trying to be alone with each other
It's so hard for us to break free
She whispers softly, "I love you"
This ain't your average rendezvous

Cause I'm in love with a married woman
And I don't care, I don't care who knows it
Yes, I'm in love with a married woman
And on her left hand there's a wedding band
She wears faithfully
And I thank God she's married to me

No cheap hotel where we'll check-in
No other lives we'll be wrecking with alibis
To hide a cheaters kiss
Cause if there's lipstick on my collar
You can bet your bottom dollar
It's the color she wears on nights like this
And every Friday here at five
We try to keep the fire alive

Cause I'm in love with a married woman
And I don't care, I don't care who knows it
Yes, I'm in love with a married woman
And on her left hand there's a wedding band
She wears faithfully
And I thank God, I thank God
I thank God she's married to me
