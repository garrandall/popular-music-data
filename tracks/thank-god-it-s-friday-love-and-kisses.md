Friday
Thank God it's Friday
Friday
Thank God it's Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday...

Hey, put a smile on your face
Things are coming your way out there somewhere tonight
It's the right time and place

I saw you, baby, for the very first time
Couldn't take my eyes off you
Girl you just had to be mine
You're the key I'm dreaming of
For it just had to be you
Girl, I know this time I'll make all my dreams come true

Hey, see the stars in his eyes
And that music in you tells you how you can find
Your way to paradise

Friday
Thank God it's Friday
Friday
Thank God it's Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday...

Hey, put a smile on your face
Things are coming your way, out there somewhere tonight
It's the right time and place
Hey, see the stars in his eyes
Tells you how you can find love (repeat and fade)
