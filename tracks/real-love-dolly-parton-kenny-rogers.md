They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life

We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need

You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up

Oh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough

We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need

We got real love

We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need

We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need
