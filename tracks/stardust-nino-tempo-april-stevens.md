And now the purple dusk
Of twilight time
Steals across
The meadows of my heart

High up in the sky
The little stars climb
Always reminding me
That we're apart

Sometimes I wonder why
I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new

And each kiss an inspiration
Whoa, but that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his
Fairy tale of paradise
Where roses bloom

Though I dream in vain
In my heart
It always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love refrain

Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

Though I dream in vain
In my heart
It always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love refrain

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his
Fairy tale of paradise
Where roses bloom

Though I dream in vain
In my heart
It always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love refrain

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale...
