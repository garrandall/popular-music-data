EAGLE'S CALLING AND HE'S CALLING YOUR NAME
TIDES ARE TURNING BRINGING WINDS OF CHANGE
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY
THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAY


THE PROMISE
THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAY

AS THRU TIME THE EARTH MOVES UNDER MY FEET
ONE STEP CLOSER TO MAKE LOVE COMPLETE
WHAT HAS THE FINAL SAY

THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAY



AND SO TIME OVER TIME
WHAT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD
NO ONE KNOWS
(No One Knows)
SO THE ONLY PROMISE IS A DAY TO LIVE, TO GIVE
AND TO SHARE WITH ONE ANOTHER

SEE THE WISDOM FROM MISTAKES IN OUR PAST
HEAR THE YOUNGER GENERATION ASK
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY
THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAY



AND SO TIME OVER TIME
WHAT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD
NO ONE KNOWS
SO THE ONLY PROMISE IS A DAY TO LIVE, TO GIVE
AND TO SHARE WITH ONE ANOTHER
