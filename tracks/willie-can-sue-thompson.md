Hey Willie
Willie can you cook? Can you cook? Hey Willie
Willie can you save a dollar bill?
Willie can you sew? Can you sew? Hey Willie

Willie can you give a girl a thrill?
Willie can you ride a black-eyed stallion?
Willie can you fight a bear?
Willie can you love? Can you love? Oh Willie

Willie will you braid my hair?
Willie can you do the things I ask you?
Willie can you do them true?
Willie can, Willie can, Willie can, fair lady

If Willie takes a shine to you
Oh, Willie can you dance? Can you prance? Hey Willie
Willie can you take me to the fair?
Willie there's a moon, there's a moon, oh Willie

Willie will you say you care?
Willie can you dig a hole to China?
Willie can you climb a tree?
Willie can you kiss? Can you kiss? Oh Willie

Willie will you please kiss me?
Willie can you do the things I ask you?
Willie can you do them true?
Willie can, Willie can, Willie can, fair lady

If Willie takes a shine to you
Oh, Willie can you run? Can you run? Oh Willie
Willie can you catch a honey bee?
Willie can you sing? Can you sing? Oh Willie

Willie will you sing to me?
Willie can you try to swim the Channel?
Willie can you fly a kite?
Willie are you bold? Can you hold me Willie?

Willie will you squeeze me tight?
Willie can you do the things I ask you?
Willie can you do them true?
Willie can, Willie can, Willie can, fair lady

If Willie takes a shine to you
Willie can you do the things I ask you?
Willie can you do them true?
Willie can, Willie can, Willie can, fair lady

If Willie takes a shine to you
