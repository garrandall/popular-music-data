This snowman is shaping up to be an 8
But not out of 10
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mother's pray it'll last a long time


I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

I want to wish you merry Christmas
Ho Ho Ho


Now they boys are all grown up
And their working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to god it don't last a long time


I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring


I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled


I want to wish you merry Christmas
(Can't do that)
I want to wish you merry Christmas
(Can't do that)
