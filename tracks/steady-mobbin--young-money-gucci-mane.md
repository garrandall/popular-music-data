Man fuck these niggas
I'ma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun butt these niggas
Take the knife off this AK and cut these niggas
Yeaah, and fuck these bitches, I swear I care about everything but these bitches, I don't care, I "so what" these bitches and I put young mula baby way above these bitches,
If it ain't broke don't break it and if he ain't shook, I'm gon shake em, I hope I don't look weak cause when a wolf cry wolf, you still see that wolf teeth muthafuckaa.

Futuristic handgun, if you act foul you get 2 shots and one, I'm at your face like lancome, hehe, you niggas softer than Rosanne son.
Hey, you cannot reach me on my samsung, I'm busy fucking the World and giving the Universe my damn tongue, crazy muthafucker I am one, but the crazy thing is, I began one, all white bricks, I'm straight like it's jumpin back to 36 nicka! big house, long hallways, got 10 bathrooms I can shit all day nigga

Desert Eagle on me You would think I'm a eagles fan Toni Braxton sniper rifle make you never breath again Fuck that nigga Kill that nigga bring him back kill him again 


Yeahh. The, the money is da motive, fuck with da money it get ugly as coyote, ok I'm reloaded, better pull it if you tote it, I buy a pound, break it down and put it in a stogie. Swagga so bright I don't even need light, I'm with a model broad she don't even eat rice, but would you believe it she dikes and she asked me for a pitcher so I gave her 3 strikes. 

I'm da man around this muthafucker, I'm so hot you probably catch a tan around this muthafucker, this rap game I got my hand around this muthafucker, yeah I said game, but I ain't playing around this muthafucker.
