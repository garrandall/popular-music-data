Down on the corner there's a reason to smile
When those evenin' shadows fall
Some kinda feelin' that it's hard to deny
Once the neon lights start to call
People out there searchin' for action
Daytime distraction slippin' right on by

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
And let the lovin' flow

Caught in the madness of a summer romance
At a moonlight rendezvous
Lost in the spirit of a sensual dance
That can cast a spell over you
All you need's a night to remember
Flyin' together on the highest high

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow

Could be the start of a million dreams we share
So lay back in the feelin' let the evenin' take you there

All we need is a night to remember
Flyin' together on the highest high

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow
All night we'll taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
That's the only way to go
