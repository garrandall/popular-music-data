It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go
Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again
With a girl, the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your night times warm and out of sight


(Been so long, long, long, long)
Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)


Well I've been thinking about
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again
Ow! Come on and do it again
