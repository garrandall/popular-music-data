Felt this way yesterday
Today I keep hurtin', yeah hurtin'
Time goes by, right on by, and I
I'm still hurtin', yeah hurtin'

You walked away, the pain began
I knew I'd never love again
Oh my heart tore apart
And I'm sure hurtin', yeah hurtin'

You walked away, the pain begain
I knew I'd never love again
Seems to me my destiny
Is to be just hurtin', yeah hurtin
