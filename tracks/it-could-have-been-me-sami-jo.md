Holding you as music softly playin,
Sounds of people's whispers sayin',
She's a pretty bride;
You're such a lucky man.

I smile and blink the tears away,
And find the proper words to say,
While aching with a pain,
They just can't understand.

It could have been me,
Wearing that dress of white.
It could have been me,
Holding you close tonight.

It could have been me,
Giving your children life.
Why can't it be me,
Who'd be your wife?

Now we're gathered,
All together,
You vow your love,
For worse or better.

Lift her veil and kiss her,
With a tender blow.
Then leading her,
Back up the aisle,
I try meet your eyes and smile,
But all the time,
My heart is breaking so...

It could have been me,
Wearing that dress in white.
It could have been me,
Holding you close tonight.

It could have been me,
Giving your children life.
It could have been me,
Who'd be your wife?

I toast the lovely bride and groom,
And as you leave the noisy room,
They say it's my turn to catch,
The bride's bouquet.

And as the crowd,
Goes streaming past,
And someone says,
He's hers at last,
I hold my pretty flowers,
And slowly walk away.

Could this be a dream,
Will I be wearin' that dress in white?
Could it really be me,
Who'd be holdin' you close tonight?

Please say that it's me,
Who'd be giving your children life.
Wake me from this dream,
Take me for your wife.

It's only a dream,
I'll be wearing that dress in white.
It was just a bad dream,
I'll be holding you close tonight.

I'm proud that it's me,
Who will be giving your children life.
That god that it's me,
Who'll be your wife.

It's only a dream,
I'll be wearing that dress in white.
It was just a bad dream,
I'll be holding you close tonight.

I'm proud that it's me,
Who will be giving your children life.
That god that it's me,
Who'll be your wife.
