Oh, oh, oh
I remember when we were kids
We shared all the hurt and tears
No matter what the weather (what the weather, what the weather)
We were always together
Then we grew up
And time went on
We became separated

When I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited
I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad day
When Toby went away

Sad day
Toby went away
Sad day
Toby went away

I came home from spring vacation
Expected to find my Toby waiting
Called her on her private phone
She didn't answer
Something was wrong
I ran all the way to her house
Rang her bell
Her mother answered and told me
To come and sit a spell

I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she'd say
And what she said
Brought tears to my eyes
I couldn't push away
Toby left on a cloudy, rainy day
She went to sing with the angels
Toby's gone away

It was a sad day
Oh, oh, Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away

It was a sad day
Oh, oh, when Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad, sad day
When Toby went away
