Fairs-Kerley

Didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And to gaze out at the night
Through your window

Just the way things are
Can be reflected in a star
And you don't stop to think
It could be that we're in love
Could be we're in love

To walk along the sand
You don't have to understand
What the world is really like
Outside your window

And didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And not stop to think
It could be that we're in love
Could be we're in love
Could be we're in love
Could be we're in love

And I don't want to go
You know I love her so
And I don't want to go
You know I love her so

Didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And to gaze out at the night
Through your window

Could be we're in love
Could be we're in love
It could be we're in love
