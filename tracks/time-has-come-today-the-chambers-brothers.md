Time has come today
Young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day
And I don't care what the others say
'Cause they say we don't listen anyway
Time has come today, Hey!
The rules have changed today, Hey!
I have no place to stay, Hey!
And I'm thinkin' about the subway, Hey!
Love has gone away, Hey!
And tears have come and gone, Hey!
Oh my God, I have to run, Hey!
I have no home, Hey!
I have no home, Hey!
Now the time has come, Time!
There's no place to run, Time!
Might get burned up by the sun, Time!

Well, I've had my fun, Time!
Well, I've been loved and put aside, Time!
And I've been crushed by tumblin' tide, Time!
And my soul's be psychedelicized, Time!
Now the time has come, Time!
There are things to realize, Time!
Time has come today, Time!
Time has come today, Time!
Time!
Now the time has come, Time!
There are things to realize, Time!
Time has come today, Time!
Time has come today, Time!
Time!
Now the time has come, Time!
Time has come today, Time!
Time has come today, Yeah!
