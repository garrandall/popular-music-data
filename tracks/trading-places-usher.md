Hey, I know what you used to 
We're gon' do something different tonight 

Now we're gonna do this thing a little different tonight 
You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride 
You gon' knock and then you gon' wait 
Ooh you gon' take me on a date 
You gonna open my door
And I'mma reach over and open yours 

Gon' pay for dinner take me to see a movie 
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me 
Girl now take me home and get up in my pants 
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed 

I'm always on the top tonight I'm on the bottom 
'Cause we're trading places 
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping 
'Cause we're trading places 
Now put it on me baby 'til I say, "Ooh, weee!" 
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me 
This is how it feels when you do it like me 
We're trading places 

Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
We're trading places 

I'll be waking you up to a cup of Folgers
Pancakes and eggs I owe ya breakfast in bed, oh baby 
And your orange juice sitting on the coaster 
Toast on the side baby strawberry and grape jelly 

You finished let me get that drink, 
Pull the curtain from the window 
Time to get up and let me make this bed up, baby

Today we're going shopping blow 30 on me 
Make it 60, spend it like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gon' rent a movie 
You order Chinese food right before you do me

You're coming on strong baby let me wash my hands 
She said, "Hurry up then get your ass to bed."

You get on top tonight I'm on the bottom 
'Cause we're trading places 
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping 
'Cause we're trading places 
Now put it on me baby 'til I say, "Ooh, weee!" 
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me 
This is how it feels when you do it like me 
We're trading places 

Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
Gon' get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
We're trading places 

(Yeah) Wash the car 
(Yeah) I'm gonna walk the dog 
(Yeah) Take out the trash 
(Yeah) With nothing but your T-shirt on 
(Yeah) I'm gonna press your shirt 
(Yeah) I'm gonna wrinkle mines up 
(Yeah) In the kitchen girl we crazy we don't give aâ

Where you want me? 
Oh baby 
Give it to me baby baby baby 
Ooh ooh baby
Baby yeah 

You get on top tonight I'm on the bottom 
'Cause we're trading places 
When I can't take no more, you say you ain't stopping 
'Cause we're trading places 
Now we're gon' do this thing a little different tonight 
Trading places 

Stay tuned for part 2 
You been me I been you
But we're gon' switch this thing back 
I'mma put it on your ass
