Man, I know what you used to
We gon' do something different tonight
Ohh-uuu
Ohhh, oh-uuu


Now we gon' do this thing a little different tonight
You gon' come over and pick me up in your ride
You gon' knock, then you gon' wait
Oh, you gon' take me on a date
You're gonna open my door
And I'ma reach over and open yours
Gon' pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear, how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed


I'm always on the top, tonight, I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places
Now put it on me, baby, 'til I say, "oo wee"
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
We're trading places


I plan on waking you up to a cup of Folgers
Pancakes and eggs, I owe you breakfast in bed, oh baby
And your orange juice sitting on a coaster
Toast on the side, baby, strawberry and grape jelly
You finished, let me get that drink
Pull the curtain from the windows
Time to get up, baby, let me make this bed up, ah yea'
Today, we going shopping, blowing 30 on me
Make it 60, spend it like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gon' rent a movie
You order Chinese food right before you do me
You coming on strong baby let me wash my hands
She said, "Hurry up", then, "get your *** in bed"


You get on the top, tonight, I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places
Now put it on me, baby, 'til I say, "oo wee"
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places
Gon' get it (gon', get it), get it get it
(Gon' get it get it), get it get it
Gon' get it (gon' get it), get it get it
(Get it get it), get it get it
Gon' get it (gon' get it), get it get it
(Get it get it), get it get it
We're trading places


(Yeah) Wash the car
(Yeah) I'm gonna walk the dog
(Yeah) Take out the trash
(Yeah) With nothing but your T-shirt on
(Ooooo, yeah) I'm gonna press your shirt
(Yeah) Gonna wrinkle mines up
(Yeah) In the kitchen, going crazy
(Yeah) we don't give a... whaaat
Where you want me?
Ohhh oh
Ohh oh
Ohhh babyyy
Give it to me, babyyy
Ohhhh oh
Ohhhh oh
Ooo-u babyy
Babyyy yeaaa
Oooo-uuu
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
Uu-u


You get on the top, tonight, I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, you say you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places


Now we gon' do this thing a little different tonight
Trading places
Stay tuned for part two
You've been me, I, I've been you
But we gon' switch this thing back
I'ma put it on your...
