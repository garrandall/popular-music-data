If she has wronged you
Found someone new
But you feel it's not over
Here's what you must do

Punish her - kill her with kindness
Oh, buy her red roses everyday
Ah, punish her with so much affection
That she will cry for the love she threw away

She'll soon rediscover with tears in her eyes
That you're the only lover she was born to idolize

Just punish her - blind her with kisses
Ah, till she can't see how she let you go
Then whisper darling, darling, darling
I still love you so

Punish her, punish her
Punish her, punish her

Ah, punish her - blind her with kisses
Till she can't see how she let you go
Then whisper darling, darling, darling
I still love you so

Punish her, punish her
Punish her, punish her
