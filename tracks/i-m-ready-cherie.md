I'm in a new place, with the same face
And nothing is familiar to me
But there's a storm rush, then the wind starts
And it's bringing out the woman in me


I know that you're out there somewhere
Waiting on a deeper connection
Now I'm looking to my left, searching on my right
'Cause we could be the greatest adventure, I'm


I'm ready
Come and find me
I'm not gonna, I got the sun on my side
It's heavy 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready, ready
I'm ready


I'm feeling my best
So baby, beware
'Cause now it's just a matter of time
(Now it's just a matter of time)
Before our paths cross, and the sky falls
The very moment that I tell you you're mine


I know that you're out there somewhere
Moving in another direction
So just hurry up and come, as fast as you can run
I've been waiting far too long, and...


I'm ready
Come and find me
I'm not gonna, I got the sun on my side
It's heavy 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready, ready


Oh, you
You gotta be close
Because I breathe you in and out, wherever I go


I'm ready
Come and find me
I'm not gonna, I got the sun on my side
It's heavy 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready
I'm ready
Come and find me
I'm not gonna, I got the sun on my side
It's heavy 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready, ready
I'm ready
Come and find me
I'm not gonna, I got the sun on my side
It's heavy 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready, ready
I'm ready


I'm ready
I'm ready (Ready, ready)
I'm ready
