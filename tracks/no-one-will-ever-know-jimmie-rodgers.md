My heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops
Start to flow

I'll cry myself to sleep
And wake up smiling
I'll miss you but

I'll them we grew tired
Tired of each other
And realized our dreams
Could never be

I'll even make believe
I never loved you
Then no one will ever know
The truth but me

I'll them we grew tired
Tired of each other
(So tired, so tired)
And realized our dreams
Could never be
(Never, never be)

I'll even make believe
I never loved you
Then no one will ever know
The truth but me

The truth but me
