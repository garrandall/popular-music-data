Give a little, take a little 
And let your little heart just cry a little 
That's the story of
That's the glory of love

Ya'll, I know what I'm talking about
Mhmm

Sigh a little, yeah, cry just a little 
And let that old wind just blow right on by a little, yeah
That's the story of
That's the glory of love

I still know what I'm talking about, ya'll

When this whole world, gets tired of us
We'll have each other and all our charms
When this whole world gets through with us
We'll have each other's arms, yeah yeah

Cry a little, sigh just a little
Let that old win just-a blow right by a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love, oh

It's the glory, glory, the glory, the glory of, it's the glory of love
Everybody knows it's the story of, it's the story of, it's the glory of love,
I got to tell you bout the glory of, the glory of, the glory of love
You got to know what the glory is, the glory is, 
everybody ought to know what the glory of love is, 
the glory of, it's the glory of, the glory of love?
