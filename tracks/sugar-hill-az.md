I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

At times I wanna watch out the Mariot, zoning on owning co-ops,
Foreign drop top coups, and yachts guzzling straight shots a scotch,
Formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock cause its scorching hot,
Making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me, Pataki, got all
Kinds of undercovers coming at me, perhaps he, won't be happy, til they
Snatch me, and place me where half slacks be, sitting in Catsaki, but
Never me, see, my destiny ta be forever free, in ecstacy, on a hill
That awaits for me, so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush,
Vivid enough ta make living this a must, plus this is real

I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

First line & (sugar hill baby, sugar hill baby)
Second line & (ayo son pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the grants in the safe, cause we spending the jacksons, the
Washingtons go to wify, ya know how we do)

No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubberbands, I'm a
Recovered man, our plans ta discover other lands, suburban places got me
Seeking for oasis, cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime
Faces, sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas, though this ain't
Promised, I'm as determined as them old timers, I wanna villa in a Costa
Rica, so I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta treat
Ya, laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid, wearing
The finest fabrics tailors ever made, me and my team, carrabeans
Forseen, I guess being down for so long I'm all in store ta see my dreams

I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master, ain't
Much more life ta feind after, but another chapter, a new way of life to
Adap ta, cause these streets a gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture
De ja vouz, I could vision my killa crew, more hospitable, consciously
Aware plus political, cause though they claim that every man created equal
What's his native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through,
But once established we living lavish, like the house of versi, paris,
I gotta have it, it so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush,
Vivid enough, ta make living this a must, plu this is real

I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on bubbly)

Its so crazy I'm down with AZ, its so lovely sippin on bubbly
Its so crazy jones and AZ, its so lovely sippin on bubbly
I wanna chill on sugar hill baby
I wanna chill on sugar hill baby
I wanna chill, I wanna chill, I wanna chill on sugar hill baby
Sugar Hill
