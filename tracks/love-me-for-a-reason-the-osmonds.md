I've never been so all alone.
Darkness never touched my day.
Never once I looked for love
The only reason is because
It always came my way.

I never had to get down on my knees.
I can't remember once I cried.
But now someone without warning
Is making darkness of the morning
And it's tearing me up inside.

Can't you see that I'm dyin'?
Tell the doctor it's a broken heart.
The only one who can make it start
Is killing me, killing me
'Cause I know I can't have her.
Yet I gotta keep tryin'
I know there's gotta be a way.
Until I know she's here to stay,
It's killing me, killing me
'Cause I know that I love her.

Nothing matters anymore.
My only want has been denied.
Now I'm left here all alone
Without someone of my own,
And it's tearin' me up inside.

Can't you see that I'm dyin'?
Tell the doctor it's a broken heart.
The only one who can make it start
Is killing me, killing me
'Cause I know I can't have her.
Yet I gotta keep tryin'
I know there's gotta be a way.
Until I know she's here to stay
It's killing me, killing me
'Cause I know that I love her.
