You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin', and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy


You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'


I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day


You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're lookin' fancy, and I like your style
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you show us everything you've got
Baby, baby, that's quite a lot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy


You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'


I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day


I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day


I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
