You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, well drive you crazy
You say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, well let you in
You drive us wild, well drive you crazy
You keep on shoutin, you keep on shoutin
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day

You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're lookin fancy and I like your style
You drive us wild, well drive you crazy
You show us everything you've got
Baby, baby that's quite a lot
And you drive us wild, well drive you crazy
You keep on shoutin, you keep on shoutin

I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll
