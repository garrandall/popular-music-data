The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh and I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary

She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into feel good
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when
I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

So now when I get lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when
I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh and I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

Lyin' in the arms of Mary
Lyin' in the arms of Mary
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Lyin' in the arms of Mary
Whoa, whoa, whoa
