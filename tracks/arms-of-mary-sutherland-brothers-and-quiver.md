The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley, Oh
Well I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them in to feel good, Oh
How I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't good when I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take Oh

So now when I get lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't good when I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley Oh
Well I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary, Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
