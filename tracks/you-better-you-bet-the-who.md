You better you better you bet, oh
You better you better you bet, oh
You better you better you bet, oh
You better you better you bet, oh


I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hm)
To the sound of old T-Rex (oh)  â€“ and Who's Next


When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet


You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife


I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Oh, a little is alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight


When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet


You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife


I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying "you better"
You better bet your life

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now




I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free


When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better (oh)
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better
You better you better you bet


You better bet your life
Or love will cut you
Just like a knife
