When I'm with you
I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up
My tongue is tied it's crazy

Can't walk, can't talk, can't eat, can't sleep
Oh, I'm in love, oh I'm in deep 'cuz baby

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
'Til all that's left of my strength is a memory, wo...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak

Convincing eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power

You know you've got a hold over me
You know you've got me where I want to be 'cuz lover

Like a wave you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this I don't know
I just know there's just no way to fight it, wo...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
I get weak I get weak I get weak

Just a kiss you can strip me defenseless
Just a touch I completely lose control
'Til all that's left of my strength is a memory, wo...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak I get weak I get weak
