Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na
No-no, hey


I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you


So I'm s'posed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home?
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you, but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean, I'mma stay if you could tell the truth
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask


Is that your bitch over there, giving me the ugly stare?
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair?
You ain't gon' respect me no, no, no till I'm not there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared


I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you


So you bought me a car, he can buy that too
I can take care of myself and I can find someone to do it too, baby
You actin' like you upgraded me, I upgraded you
You and me, Fashion Week at Paris, I put you on to that new
But you took advantage, oh you took advantage, oh you took advantage
I cannot understand, I cannot understand, I cannot understand it
I thought you'd always be there for me, yeah, yeah
But if you ask me if I knew betta now, hell yeah


So you can keep that bitch over there, giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair
You ain't gon' respect me no, no, no till I ain't there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared


I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you


Baby, tell me what's it
Gonna take to keep it
All the way one hundred
You won't get it till I'm gone away
Away


I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you


Oh, I hate, I hate that I'm
Singing this song
Singing this song
‘Cause I love you
Yeah, I love you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I’m all cried out
I’m all tried out
I’m all fired out
Yeah, right now, it’s killing me
Cause now I have to find someone else
When all I wanted was you
