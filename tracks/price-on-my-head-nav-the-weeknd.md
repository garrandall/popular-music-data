I pull up to my town
With a price on my head
I pull up to my town I'm outside
They want see me drown
It's on sight it's what they said
I heard these niggas want to take my life
I don't apologize I would die for this shit
I don't apologize I don't hide
I'm Kubrick with the shine
Got that ice on my neck
They wanna throw a bag on a

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm asleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm asleep when I'm dead

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm asleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm asleep when I'm dead

I cut off all my side hoes
In the cab, with a dime though
All these girls been ran through
On the low real snipe mode
I can't sleep, that's insomnia
So much ice like I'm Tanya
All my boys livin' debt free
Hit Squad like Wesley
I want head on a jet ski
She give me head for a Fendi
For a Prada she get sexy
For a Lambo or a Bentley
My mansion is no joke
House party like 1 Oak
Weed louder than gun smoke
Get high off one toke

You're beefin' with yourself tell the truth
Niggas on your side they would ride for me too
Still wastin' they time tryin' to come for me too
I'm too busy faded in Japan with the crew
With the crew, with the crew, with the crew
Shout out all the girls who've been ridin' for me too
Niggas want me dead, I've been dead, nothin' new
Niggas want me dead for a bag

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead

They tried to get me and they missed if we send shots then they gon' hit
I can get you top taken off for less than a quarter brick (Yeah)
One of my rings could get him off, we'll check him off the list
My shooter a Codeine addict he'll do it for a pint of Actavis
Since I make cash got a lot of racks I still want more
I can tell by the way you carry yourself you've never sold no dope
Growin' up my momma beat my ass and cleaned my mouth with soap
Now she showin' up to work in a Balenciaga coat

Price on my head got your life on my neck
Put a brown kid in the south side racks and me is what you get
My block was like the car wash you drive in you gon' get wet
Had to take a lot of losses made me comfortable with death
Took to much Act' had to pop a Xan to reset
His bitch gave me some top and now he want to send me threats
Livin' my best life I know my ops just wanna see me dead
Took his life I paid him double what they put on my head

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Nine when I rest with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid I'm a sleep when I'm dead
