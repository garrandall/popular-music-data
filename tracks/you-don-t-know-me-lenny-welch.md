You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so

And anyone could tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me

No, no, no
You don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight

To you, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
But you don't know me

For I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart ached
With love for you

Afraid and shy
I let my chance go by
The chance you might
Have loved me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy

To never, never, never know
The one who loves you so
No, you don't know me

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy

To never, never, never know
The one who loves you so
No, you don't know me
