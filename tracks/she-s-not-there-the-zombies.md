Well no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried


But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!


Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there


Well no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well no one told me about her
Though they all knew


But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!


Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!


Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there
