Got someone else to keep you warm
You've been seen in cozy places
But there's a calm before the storm
Like he's been seen with other faces
Folks say he changes with the night

To break her heart is second nature
Oh girl
He'll never do you right
I'm warning you
Your heart's in danger

But you can put your love on me
And you won't be lonely
I'll be waiting patiently
Cause I love you only

He can never love you like I do
Like I do
No, he'll never ever love you, baby
Like I do

Oh
He'll never ever need you
Need you
Half as much as I do
Like I do

He could never want you
Never want you, baby
Like I do

I know I can be oversensitive
Well, I wouldn't if you didn't mean so much to me
The grass always seems greener
Over on the other side
You see
But you can bet your love on me

Girl, you won't be lonely, no
I'm into you totally
You see
You see I love you only

I see that fire in your eyes
And all this passion comes as no surprise
Here's hoping soon you'll recognize
But until then
Let me emphasize

Na, na, na, na, na
He'll never love you
Like I do
Na, na, na, na, no

Bet your love on me
Bet your love on me
And you won't be lonely

I'm into you totally
Totally
Cause I love you only
He'll never ever, ever
Like I do
Never
Not like
