When I think about you baby, I can't help it (help it)
I lose all my focus and I just can't stand it
I get so excited every time I hear your name (your name)
and you don't reciprocate and it's a damn shame. Oh

See, all I'm trying to do girl is give you my time
(give you my time)
Baby, you know, you better not move too slow 'cause I'm movin' on
I'll take the chance and roll the dice,
I might miss out on the love of my life.

'Cause you know as time moves on
I won't always be around
And I'll be gone, and I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you, and you know this much is true
As time moves on I gonna be gone 'cause I'm movin' on

I know it sounds crazy but I just can't do this (do this)
It feels like we're wasting time so I'll get to it
When I look into your eyes I can see right through you (through you)
And you don't feel the same way that I do, Oh

See, all I'm trying to do girl is give you my time
(give you my time)
And you know, you better not move too slow 'cause I'm movin' on lady
I'll take the chance and roll the dice,
I might miss out on the love of my life.

'Cause you know as time moves on
I won't always be around
And I'll be gone, and I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you, and you know this much is true
As time moves on I'm gonna be gone 'cause I'm movin' on

I'm telling you, you really missed out on a good thing for sure.
As a matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't walk through that door.
I'm a better man for it, said I can learn from it or ignore it.
You know I've seen it all before
Now your best friend's at my door.

I'm movin' on
Oh

'Cause you know as time moves on
(Said I'm movin' on)
As time moves on

'Cause you know as time moves on
I won't always be around
(No, I won't)
And I'll be gone, and I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you, and you know this much is true
As time moves on I'm gonna be gone 'cause I'm movin' on

I'm movin' on baby,
I'm movin' on
movin' on

Ah, I'll be gone,
Yes I will.
