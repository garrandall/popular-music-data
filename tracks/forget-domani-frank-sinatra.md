Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Domani, forget domani
Let's live for now and anyhow who needs domani?
The moonlight, let's share the moonlight
Perhaps together we will never be again

Ah, che luna, oh, che mare
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
I get so dizzy when you're standing near
It's not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
Let's take the minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say
"When you're in love, tomorrow never comes"

Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Domani, madonne, domani!
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
Let's take the minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say
"When you're in love tomorrow never comes"

Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Oh, let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Oh, let's forget about tomorrow
