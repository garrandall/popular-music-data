Hey girl, you got me walking in the dark
I've got a feeling that my heart is just your game
'Cause you and I, we were so happy at the start
But you've been playing much to hard for me to take

How could you lie to me?
Your actions don't vouch for what you say
I'm just like a child at play
And your love's a toy you tried to take away from me

Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play

It's hard to say the things I feel for you today
But now I know my heart will never be the same
Girl, I'm no toy for you to play with everyday
I'll show you just the kind of game I like to play

How could you lie to me?
Your actions don't vouch for what you say
I'm just like a child at play
And your love's a toy you tried to take away from me

Stop, you can't lie to me anymore
Stop, you can't lie to me anymore
Stop, you can't lie to me anymore
Stop, you can't lie to me anymore

No, no, no, no more lies
No, no, no, no more lies
No, no, no, no more lies
No, no, no, no more lies

Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
