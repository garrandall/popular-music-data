Saturday night and a six pack, girl,
A big star shining on a small town world,
It's a helluva life, it's a helluva life.

And KC lights on a dirt road dance,
You take that kiss just as far as you can,
It's a helluva life, oh, it's a helluva life.

And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swaying,
To a song that's playing on the radio station.
The bad times make the good times better,
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride...
Yeah, it's a helluva life. It's a helluva life.

And we all have faith, and we all have hope,
But we're all a little lost in the same damn boat.
It's a helluva life, yeah, it's a helluva life.

Something bout the night girl,
When you got the right girl,
Sitting right beside you,
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking bout why we're here,
And where we're going,
Baby, here we are,
And all I know is...

Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swaying,
To a song that's playing and the world starts fadin'.
The bad times make the good times better,
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride...
Yeah, it's a helluva life, it's a helluva life.

Something bout the night, girl,
When you got the right, girl,
Sitting right beside you,
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking bout why we're here,
And where we're going,
Baby, here we are,
And all I know is...

Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swaying,
To a song that's playing, it's a perfect combination.
The bad times make the good times better,
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride...
Yeah, it's a helluva life, it's a helluva life.

Bad times make the good times better.

Aw one helluva life.

Look in her eyes and you're gone forever.

It's a helluva life.

Yeah, it's a helluva life.

It's a helluva life.
