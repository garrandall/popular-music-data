Boy, you can just believe
I'm the only girl in your life
I'll be your sugar in the morning
And the sweet stuff you need at night
And you can just best believe
When it comes down to making love
I'll satisfy your every need
And every fantasy you think of


So when you need a little peace of mind
Come on over, boy, anytime
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house
So when you need some love and tenderness
And it's me, baby, that you miss
Here's the key to unlock the door
To my house, my house
Woo-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Boy, anytime of the day or night
When you call me I will be there
Just call me up on the phone
When you need someone around to care
And when you feel sad and blue
You just come see me anytime
I'll kiss away all your tears
And your fears you can leave behind


So when you need a little peace of mind
Come on over, boy, anytime
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house
So when you need some love and tenderness
And it's me, baby, that you miss
Here's the key to unlock the door
To my house, in my house


Woo-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In my house)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
