I wanna lie on my bed
And do nothing (And do nothing)
I don't care what anyone says
I got you on my mind
Thinking 'bout one thing (Thinking 'bout one thing)
Gonna show you how I do it best


Put my lips on your mouth
Keep you coming around
'Cause I like it, yeah
Put your hands on my hips
Take me down, sink this ship
Boy, I can't resist


I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans
Can you get with that?
Give you something like you never had
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees
And it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you


Those other guys when they call
I might answer {I might answer}
But you're the one
I'm thinking 'bout
So baby don't disappoint
Just move faster (Just move faster)
And show me what you're feeling now


Put my lips on your mouth
Keep it coming around
'Cause I like it, yeah
Nothing's wrong
It's alright
Got permission from me tonight
So turn off the lights (Turn off the lights)


I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans
Can you get with that?
Give you something like you never had
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees
And it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you


Now I'm going crazy
I'm tired of waiting
My lips are on fire
I just want you to know
I'm losing my patience
For the time that you've wasted


Put your lips on my mouth
Put your lips on my mouth
Put your lips on my...


I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans
Can you get with that?
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees
And it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans
Can you get with that?
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees
And it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
'Cause I only wanna be wanted by you
