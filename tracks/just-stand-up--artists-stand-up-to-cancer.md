Everything will be alright yeah
Alright yeah, alright yeah


The heart is stronger than you think
Like it could go through anything
And even when you think it can't
It finds a way to still push on though


Sometimes you want to run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into your heart
The beat goes on


I'm telling you

Things get better

Through

Whatever

If you fall,

Dust it off,

Don't let up


Don't you know you can go be your own miracle


You need to know!


If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up


Oh it's like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face

Just because you go through it

Don't mean it got to take control, no oh oh

You ain't got to find no hiding place

Because the heart can beat the hate

Don't want to let the mind keep playing you

And saying you can't go on


I'm telling you

Things get better

Through

Whatever

If you fall

Dust if off

Don't let up


Don't you know
You can go
Be your own
Miracle!


You need to know!


If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
Through it all, just stand up


You don't got to be a prisoner in your mind

If you fall, dust it off

You can live your life

Yeah

Let your heart be your guide

Yeah yeah yeah

You will know there's a good if you trust the good


Everything will be alright, yeah

Light up the dark, if you follow your heart


And it will get better

Through whatever


If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up


You got it in you, find it within
You got it in you, find it within yeah
You got it in you, find it within
You got it in you, find it within yeah
You got it in you, find it within
You got it in you, find it within yeah
Find it within you, find it within


Through it all, just stand up
