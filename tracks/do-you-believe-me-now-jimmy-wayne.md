Do you remember
The day I turned to you and said I didn't like the way he was looking at you
Yeah
How he made you laugh
You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination


So do you believe me now
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking bout
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah me I'm missin you way across town
So do you believe me now
I'm kicking myself
For being the one foolish enough giving him the chance to step in my shoes
Ohhh
He was bidin his time
When he saw our love was having a moment of weakness
He was there between us


So do you believe me now
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking bout
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah me I'm missin you way across town
So do you believe me now
Oh yeah I bet now you see the light
Oh yeah what's the use in being right
We're not the lonely one tonight


So do you believe me now
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking bout
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah me I'm missin you way across town
So do you believe me now
Yeah
So do you believe me now
Yeah
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah me I'm missin you way across town
So do you believe me now
