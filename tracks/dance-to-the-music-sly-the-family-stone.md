 Get up and dance to the music! 
Get on up and dance to the fonky music! 
Dum-dumm du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm
Du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm - du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm
 Dance to the Music, Dance to the Music 
 Hey Greg! 
 What? 
 All we need is a drummer, 
For people who only need a beat, yeah!

I'm gonna add a little guitar 
And make it easy to move your feet 

 I'm gonna add some bottom, 
So that the dancers just won't hide 

 You might like to hear my organ 
I said 'Ride Sally Ride' 
 Cynthia, Jerry!!
You might like to hear the horns blowin', 
Cynthia on the throne, yeah! 

Listen to me

 All the squares, go home! 
Aaaaah, yeah!!!


Dum-dumm du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm
Du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm - du-du-du-du-du-dum-dumm
 Dance to the Music, Dance to the Music
