Did I do wrong
By coming home?
Have you found
Somebody new?

I've called you twice
No answer at all
By telephone

I'd like to know
What did daddy do
Oh-hoo hoo, oh-hoo hoo

Your best friend
Or not
You tell me

But someone was trying to take my place
I know I shouldn't have stayed away
So long
That loves you, that's all I can say

Just for your love
I've traveled night and a day

Oh I'm crazy
About you
I need you so
You're driving me crazy

And by the way
I'd like to know
What did daddy do
Oh-hoo hoo, oh-hoo hoo
