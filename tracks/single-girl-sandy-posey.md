The single girl all alone in a great big town
The single girl gets so tired of love letting her down
The life's unreal and the people are homely
And the nights can get so lonely
The single girl needs a sweet loving man to lean on
I'm a single girl wondering if love could be passing her by
I'm a single girl and I know all about men and their lies
Nobody loves me cause nobody knows me
Nobody takes the time to go slowly

The single girl needs a sweet loving man to lean on
I gotta make my own way
There's rent I gotta pay
I need a night-time love to get me through the day
I'm a single girl all alone in a great big town
I'm a single girl and I get so tired of love letting me down
But there's a man I've yet to know
Waiting somewhere I've yet to go
Someday I'll have a sweet loving man to lean on
