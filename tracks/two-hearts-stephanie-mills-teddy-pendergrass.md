Came into my life a stranger
You captured my heart
Now I've got to face the danger
I'm ready to start

Thought that I could make it on my own
All alone
I tried too hard to fake it
Now the truth must be known


Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure


You've given me so much of yourself
'Til I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for you grows strong in every way
You are my life


Never thought that love could touch me
Move me this way
Don't you ever leave me, baby
Promise you'll stay

I'm so glad I got you, girl
Turnin' my world all around
We won't let nobody change
This love that we, we found


Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure


You've given me so much of yourself
'Til I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for grows stronger every day
You are my life


Two hearts are always better (Always, always)
Two hearts (Two) are always better (Me and you, yeah)
(Just me and you) (Me and you) (Tell them two)
Two hearts (Two hearts) are always better (Always better)
(Don't you know? You got to know)
(Baby, me and you) (Talkin' 'bout two)
Two hearts (One and one makes two, heh) are always better
(Me and you, yeah) (Oh, oh, yeah)
Two hearts are always better (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Two hearts (Yeah, two) are always better (Don't you know, two, yeah, two)

Two hearts are always better
Two hearts are always better (Don't you know, talkin' 'bout me and you)
Two hearts (That makes two) are always better
(Always) (Yeah) (Always better, girl) (Two)
Two hearts (Two hearts) are always better (Tried so hard to make it, baby)
Two hearts are always better
