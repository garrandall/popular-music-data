Hey... 
Woo... 
Alright baby... 
Ohhh... 
Oh... 
Yeah... 

I can make the pain disappear... 
And I can erase the past... Oh... 
I can make the future shine so bright... 
And I can make right now alright... Yeah... 

I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl... 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl... 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl... 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl... 

All I got is concrete all around Me... Wooo... 
But I can see the countryside... 
You can be rich when you're poor... 
Poor when you're rich... 
It can be raining and I can make the sun shine... 

I got it you got it we got the (Wooo) magic girl... 
I got it (You know You got it baby) You got it, We got the magic girl 
I got it (I've got it baby) You got it, We got the magic girl 
I got it (You know I got it baby) You got it, We got the magic girl 

I know sometimes sometimes you feel no hope... 
But I've been there upon that lonely road... 
I took whatever gift he offered me... 
Because I knew that he would set me free... 

(Whoa) I got it, You got it (Wooo) We got the magic girl... 
I got it (Magic baby) You got it, We got the magic (woo) girl... 
I got it (We got the magic baby) You got it, We got the magic girl... 

Skip 

I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl... 

Wooo 

Science they can't prove it... 
But I know I can do it... 
I can fly... 
I can bend metal with my mind... 
I can wake up in a paradise... Ohhhh... 

We got that magic... 
We got that magic... 
Hey... 
We got that magic... 
We got that magic... 

Hey 

We got that magic 
We got that magic 
Oooh 

Got that magic come on 
Hey 

I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl 
I got it, You got it, We got the magic girl
