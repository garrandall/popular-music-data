When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Well, I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
That it gets higher day by day

Oh, do I love you, my, oh, my
Oh, baby, river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, oh, oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young girl, did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down

'Cause it goes on and on like the river flows
And it gets deeper, baby, heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it goes

Do I love you, my, oh, my
River deep, mountain high (I said so high)
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

I love you, baby, like a flower loves spring
And I love you, baby, like a robin loves to sing
Oh, oh and I love you, baby, like a schoolgirl loves her pie, yeah
And I love you, baby, river deep and mountain high

I love you, baby
A mountain so high
A river deep
Oh, oh, baby, baby
I love you, baby
I bet you do
Oh, I love you, baby
Tell me you love me
Yes, I do, oh

Do I love you, my, oh, my (Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
River deep, mountain high
Oh, if I lost you, would I cry (Would I cry, baby)
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

Tell me, do you love me, baby?
I love you, yeah
River so deep, mountain so high
Oh, yeah, baby
Oh-ho, yeah
River deep, mountain high
River so deep, mountain so, so, so, so high
That's how I love you, baby
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, yeah, baby
I love you, baby, yes, yes, yes, I do
Tell me, tell me, tell me one more time
