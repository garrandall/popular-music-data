People getting smarter
Every day, yeah
Things around me changing
In every way, yeah
I get the feeling
Time is passing me by
And I'll be left alone
Here to cry
I'm just a fool for you, girl
Always just a fool for you, girl
I know that you don't love me
But still you won't tell me so
Cause you like to see me suffer
Cause you know I can't let you go
Yeah, this magic spell
You cast on me
Sometimes I wonder
How long it's gonna be
I'm just a fool for you, girl
Always just a fool for you, girl
Just a fool for you
Now maybe one day, yeah
You'll realize, yeah
The mistake you made
You might even apologize, yeah
Until the day
You have a change of heart
I'll be right here
Til death do us part
I'm just a fool for you, girl
Always just a fool for you, girl
Always gonna be a fool for you...
