The wheels of life are turning so much faster
The restless hands of time pass me by
There are dreams I'll never live to see
But as long as you believe in me
I'll still feel them on the way
As I take life day by day

Oh the wheels of time are turning so much stronger
The blues of days gone by weigh me down
But maybe love will come to rescue me
And I'll never set you free
Like the sea runs to the shore
I've come back yo you once more

The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning round and round

And if I should only have one tomorrow
It's a lifetime if I knew
I could spend that day with you

Ooh, the wheels of love will turn my world forever
I want you in my arms for all time
And maybe love will come to rescue me
And I'll never ever set you free
Like the sea runs to the shore
I'll love you forever more

The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning round and round

The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning so much faster
The wheels of life are turning so much stronger
