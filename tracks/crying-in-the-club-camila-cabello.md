You think that you'll die without him
You know that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry 'way your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club

You may think that you'll die without her
But you know that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry 'way your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club

You think that you'll die without him
You know that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

I said ain't no (ain't no)
Ain't no crying
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying
I said ain't no (ain't no)
Ain't no crying
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying

Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry 'way your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I

Ain't no crying in the club (ain't no crying, no crying, no crying, no)
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club (ain't no crying, no crying, no crying, no)
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
