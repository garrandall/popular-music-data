Send your kisses my way
Bring your sweet heart to me
Iâve been waiting for so long

Tell me all your stories
Leave some open for me
Write your name into this song

Iâll walk through the fire
Iâll run through the rain
Iâll wait for forever
If Love is your name
Your name

Catch a wind from heaven
Sail down while Iâm sleeping
Wake me with the morning sun
Oh, oh- oh
Iâll dream of you until you come

Iâll walk through the fire
Iâll run through the rain
Iâll Wait for forever
If Love is your name

Valentines keep knocking
My heart keeps on walking
Darling Iâll hold on for you
For You, for you

Iâll walk through the fire
Iâll run through the rain
Iâll wait for forever
If Love is your name

If love is your name
If love is your name
