Send your kisses my way
Bring your sweet heart to me
I’ve been waiting for so long

Tell me all your stories
Leave some open for me
Write your name into this song


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll wait for forever
If Love is your name
Your name


Catch a wind from heaven
Sail down while I’m sleeping
Wake me with the morning sun
Oh, oh- oh
I’ll dream of you until you come


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll Wait for forever
If Love is your name


Valentines keep knocking
My heart keeps on walking
Darling I’ll hold on for you
For You, for you


I’ll walk through the fire
I’ll run through the rain
I’ll wait for forever
If Love is your name


If love is your name
If love is your name
