The First Day Of Summer
Tony Carey

Well The Kid and me were the team to beat
We could stand up to the big boys
Generate some heat
And we never thought nothin' about
Livin on the streat back then

Yes sir, we lied a little
And we maybe stole some
Sayin "Southern CA here we come"
And we took off down the highway sayin'
Never goin' back again

Chorus:
It was on the first day of summer
We were the number one outfront runner
On the first day of summer
Nothin feels the same
And it feels so good
It was on the first day of summer
It was on the first day of summer
On the first day of summer
The whole world knows your name
And it feels so good

Now the kid was drivin and I rode shotgun
We were splittin up the money
From our number ones

Beatin' time to the radio
Yes I'm gonna be someone

Campin' by the road out in Santa Fe
The kid stole the keys and he drove away
I wound up washin' dishes at a a Holiday Inn
Sometime I wonder what became of him

Repeat chorus
