Someone's got to win
Someone's got to lose
That's the way it's got to be.
I guess that it's so
But now (I'd really like to know)
Just why does 'loser'
Always have to be me.

Someone's love will last
Someone's love will end
It's as simple as A... ABC.
That's not really news
You know (somebody has to lose),
But why does 'loser'
Always have to be me.

I don't ask much
Just that lady luck touch me one time
And maybe then I will win back
The love that was mine.

Someone's got to lose
And end up with the blues
But why does 'loser'
Always have to be me.

Why does loser
Have to be me.
