Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and riding and slipping and sliding
It's magic

And you, and your sweet desire,
You took me, oh oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a livin' thing,
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose.

I'm taking a dive
Dive, dive, dive,

Making believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day,
I'm taking a dive
Moving in line then you look back in time
To the first day
I'm taking, I'm taking

And you and your sweet desire
(Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me
Oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

(And I'm taking a dive on the slide hey)

Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream,
(I'm taking a dive)
So let her go don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream
(I'm taking, I'm taking)

And you and your sweet desire
(Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me
Oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

It's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing...
