This guy is crazy 
This guy is a weirdo 
Outsidaz, what you wanna do 
This is the gang im in 
Outsidaz, comin to you 

Lord have mercy for any rapper that showed up 
First it was Oklahoma now its your house im blowin up 
Cuz im quick to butt fuck yo moms 
And fuck a nine Bizarre's shootin nuclear bombs 
Think about it before you diss me on a track 
I hang with niggas that just got out and ready to go back 
Bizarre making wack crews fold 
Me and Bill Clinton wanna bust in hoes that only 14 years old (shes young) 
Doin drive by's in fuckin pink caddies 
Tie you up and beat you worse the L L Cool J's daddy 
This is a crime that even Mc Gruff couldnt solve 
Chew dog and its not you niggas is what leavin in __ 
You don fucked around and gotta get a fix 
Ya'll niggas in trouble cuz I done fucked around and hit a six 
Who the fuck is ya'll wack niggas ignoring 
Put me in a room full of murderers they be dead by the mornin 


Rap guys - liten to me 
Listen to me rap guys 
Diss Bizarre you die 

We can do this like men 
Or talk it out real right 
Or do it my way and drive by later on tonite 
Break in your house hang your sister by her shirt 
Bury her in the dirt, wait for you moms to get home from work 
Id a killed so many M.C's I cant count the number 
Niggas writin me letters say "I know what you did last summer" 
One rapper tested me and though I was a punk 
And i aint seen his body since I threw it out of my trunk 
Fuck around and throw your ass in the lake 
And never be found like my high school prom date 
Bizarre stick ill, shoot vein in my fathers vein 
And watch a nigga die like Sugar Hill 
I'm sicker the a transvestite gettin fucked by a paraplegic 
I say dumb shit when im weeded 
Your girl sucked me, bitch you better duck me 
Or fuck around end up room mates with Mike Hutley 


Rap guys - liten to me 
Listen to me, rap guys  
Diss Bizarre you die 

I be watchin shows from here to Chi town 
Tell your boys this his last day im shuttin this block down 
Im the type a guy come to your stage show and BOO you 
Tell you you can use my sample 
And two weeks later i'll screw you 
Diss me on your stage show 
Diss my while you high 
But aint no garauntee youll make it out this bitch fuckin alive 
I got weed and drinks and some fuckin slut 
Fuck her in the butt, burn her back with hot cigarette butts 
Quick to throw the fuckin nine up 
My crew gets more dirty looks then Queen Latifa in a police line up 
Dont wind up like your boy name Romer 
Have your parents wondering when your ass is comin out this coma 
Smell the aroma when my crew hits the stage 
Somebody stop this machine in a rage 
Fuck your girl disrespect her then i teck her 
Bizarre 98 bitch federation records 


Rap guys - liten to me 
Listen to me rap guys 
Diss Bizarre you die
