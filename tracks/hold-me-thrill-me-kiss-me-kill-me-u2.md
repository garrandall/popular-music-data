You don't know how you took it 
You just know what you got 
Oh Lordy you've been stealing 
From the theives and you got caught 
In the headlights 
Of a stretch car 
You're a star 

Dressing like your sister 
Living like a tart 
They don't know what you're doing 
Babe, it must be art 
You're a headache 
In a suitcase 
You're a star 

Oh no, don't be shy 
You don't have to go blind 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me 

You don't know how you got here 
You just know you want out 
Believing in yourself 
Almost as much as you doubt 
You're a big smash 
You wear it like a rash 
Star 

Oh no, don't be shy 
There's a crowd to cry 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me 

They want you to be Jesus 
They'll go down on one knee 
But they'll want their money back 
If you're alive at thirty-three 
And you're turning tricks 
With your crucifix 
You're a star 

(Oh child) 

Of course you're not shy 
You don't have to deny love 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me
