Turn me around, don't let me walk out forever
If there's a chance, the slightest chance, darling never say never
You know it's out of my hands, 'cos I'm in way over my head

But it won't take me long, you could blink and I'll be gone
In your dark oversight, there must be one last breath of our love

Chorus:
Now if there's something I can say, to make you see it half my way
Just tell me once, before I go
And if there's something I can do, to make it all back up to you
Just tell me once, before I go, before I go

Angel of pride, girl won't you come and release me
Is it such a crime, oh such a crime, to surrender so easy
You know how hard I've tried, well maybe I've tried too damn hard
But it won't take you long, you can break this liaison

And if there's something I can say, to make you see it half my way
Just tell me once, before I go
And if there's something I can do, to make it all back up to you
Just tell me once, before I go

I don't know where this road ever ends
The point of existence, your die-hard resistance
And I don't know where the shoulder begins
And gravity crumbles, tenacity tumbles

(Guitar solo)

But it won't take me long, you could blink and I'll be gone
In your dark oversight, there must be one last breath of our life

If there's something I can say, to make you see it half my way
Just tell me once, before I go
And if there's something I can do, to make it all back up to you
Just tell me once, before I go

And if there's something I can say, to make you, make you see it half my way
(Just tell me once), before I go, before I go

Ohtell me once before I go
If there, if there's something I can say to you
To make you see it half my way, tell me, tell me
If there's something I can say, oh now baby, to make you turn around...
