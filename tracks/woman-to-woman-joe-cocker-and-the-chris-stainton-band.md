Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache (hardache to hardache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)

Woman to woman
Ev'rything I say got labeled and has happened
Seems to come your way
You don't care if it rains or shines
Long as you know what's been goin' down at the local rodeo

Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Hardache to hardache (hardache to hardache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)

Lover to lover
Well, I'm brown as brown can be
Don't let it get on me
You talk about money, honey
And then you pray child
But I don't wanna be alone long before

Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Hardache to hardache (hardache to hardache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)

Hardache to hardache
Don't let it break so fast
Think about all you have
And let it last
I can't take no more teardrops from you
But that don't give you no right to shout

Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Hardache to hardache (hardache to hardache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Woman, yeah
