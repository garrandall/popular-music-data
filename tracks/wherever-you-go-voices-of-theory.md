Since you left me
My life ain't been the same
I'm useless without your love
I'm calling, crying out your name
But when I look around
Your love is nowhere to be found
Please come back to me
Baby, you know you're my everything
Who will love me and who will care
Who will be there when I need someone for me
Who will be there to dry my eyes
When I fall down on my knees
Will I hear you say


Wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know I'm waiting
You know I'll never leave
Whatever it takes
Whatever's at stake
Just know I love you
And know I'll be right here

And no matter what it takes
I'll be waiting here for you always

Goodbye is such a hard thing to say
When you're all I know
When you're my everything
And who will stay and care for me
When you're gone, I'll be all alone
Who will care and comfort
And fulfill my needs
I've got to know, baby

Who will love me and who will care
Who will be there when I need someone for me
Who will be there to dry my eyes
When I fall down on my knees
Will I hear you say



All my life I've waited for someone like you
So please don't say it's over
Don't tell me
This just can't be true
Please don't leave me
Don't walk away
You know your love is something I can't do without
So whatever it takes
Or how much my heart aches
You know I'll always be around
