Somebody's gonna hurt someone 
before the night is through 
Somebody's gonna come undone. 
There's nothin' we can do. 
Everybody wants to touch somebody 
if it takes all night. 
Everybody wants to take a little chance, 
Make it come out right. 

There's gonna be a heartache tonight, 
a heartache tonight, I know. 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, I know. 
Lord, I know. 

Some people like to stay out late 
Some folks can't hold out that long 
But nobody wants to go home now. 
there's too much goin' on. 

This night is gonna last forever. 
Last all, last all summer long. 
Some time before the sun comes up 
The radio is gonna play that song. 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, 
A heartache tonight, I know. 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, 
A heartache tonight, I know. 
Lord I know. 

There's gonna be a heartache tonight, 
the moon's shinin' bright 
so turn out the light, and we'll get it right. 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a 
heartache tonight I know. 
Heartache baby, 

Somebody's gonna hurt someone, (somebody) 
Before the night is through 
Somebody's gonna come undone, 
There's nothin' we can do 
(Everybody) Everybody wants to touch somebody 
if it takes all night 
Everybody wants to take a little chance 
To make it come out right 

There's gonna be a heartache tonight 
A heartache tonight, I know 
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, 
A heartache tonight ,I know 
Let's go. 
We can beat around the bushes; 
we can get down to the bone 
We can leave it in the parkin' lot, 
but either way, there's gonna be a 
heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know. 
There'll be a heartache tonight 
a heartache tonight I know.
