Oh. Hiya.
I miss you so much
Your light, your smile, your way
and everything about us.
Now you're gone,
You're still here in my heart, in my tears.
Yeah you sure left your mark.
And we were just getting started.


It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough together
but it was long enough,
yeah it was long enough to last forever.

Sometimes I get so mad, I scream, I swear at this
cause this isn't how we planned it.
I sit here in a cold room
prayin', waitin' on you,
to run back through that door,
to the way it was before
you left



I've been cheated (I've been Cheated)
Defeated (defeated, to believe)
To believe that you're gone.
(You're gone, you're gone)
Oh it was wrong (so wrong, so wrong)

It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough

No



It wasn't long enough
