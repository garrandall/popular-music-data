When I go to sleep (sleep)
I never count sheep (sheep)
I count all the charms
About Linda (Linda)

And lately it seems (it seems)
In all of my dreams (my dreams)
I walk with my arms
About Linda (Linda)

But what good does it do me
For Linda doesn't know I exist
I can't help feeling gloomy
Think of all the loving I've missed
(Linda, Linda)

We pass on the street (uh huh)
My heart skips a beat (uh huh)
I say to myself
Hello, Linda (Linda)

If only she'd smile (she'd smile)
I'd stop her a while (a while)
And then I would get
To know Linda (Linda)

But miracles still happen
And when my lucky star
Begins to shine
With one lucky break
I'll make Linda mine

(Linda, Linda)
(Linda, Linda)

But what good does it do me
For Linda doesn't know I exist
I can't help feeling gloomy
Think of all the loving I've missed
(Linda, Linda)

We pass on the street (uh huh)
My heart skips a beat (uh huh)
I say to myself
Hello, baby (Linda)

If only she'd smile (she'd smile)
I'd stop her a while (a while)
And then I would get
To know Linda (Linda)

But miracles still happen
And when my lucky star
Begins to shine
With one lucky break
I'll make Linda mine

Ah, I said Linda
(Linda, Linda, Linda...)
I said Linda
