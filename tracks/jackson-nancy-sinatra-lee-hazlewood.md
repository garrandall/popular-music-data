We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson
I'm gonna mess around (yeah?)
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Well, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health (hm)
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, yeah, go to Jackson
But go comb that hair
I'm gonna snowball Jackson
Go ahead and see if I care

When I breeze into that city
The people gonna stoop and bow (ha ha)
All them women gonna make me teach 'em
What they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson
Ya turn-a loose-a my coat
'cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote

They'll laugh at you in Jackson (I doubt it)
And I'll be dancin' on a pony keg
They'll lead you 'round that town
Like a scalded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go to Jackson
You big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson
Behind my Japan fan

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went ou-ou-out
Go to Jackson and that's a natural fact
We're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout

We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
