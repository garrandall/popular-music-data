They call me Good Time Charlie
Playboy with a whole lot of soul
I said, they call me Good Time Charlie
Playboy with a whole lot of soul
I'm the last of the big time spenders
I keep a pocket full of gold

Put on your red dress, baby
We're going up to Sugar Hill
I said, put on your red dress, baby
We're going up to Sugar Hill
Come on, come on
If you won't, your sister will

Put on your red wig, baby
I want you to ball with me
Put on your red wig, baby, yeah
I want you to go out and ball with me
Don't you know the sky is the limit, baby?
Little girl and everything's free

I can make you feel good
Just like I said, I would
I can make you feel so good
Just like I said, I would
It's all right, oh, it's all right

They call me Good Time Charlie
Playboy with a whole lot of soul
They call me, they call me Good Time Charlie
Playboy with a whole lot of soul
I'm the last of the big time spenders
Little girl, I keep a pocket full of gold

I can make you feel nice
Yeah, yeah
I can make you feel so good
Just like I said, I would now
Come on
I said, we going up to Sugar Hill, baby
