Come on Charlotte
Wake up San Diego, Milwaukee, Miami
Put your two lips together and kiss


We're kissing in Cleveland and Cincinnatti too
Way out in Chicago, I'll tell you what to do
They party all over, even in St. Lou
So baby, get ready, and I'll be kissing you


Oh, oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight


We're kissing in Dallas
And Philly's going wild
So let's kiss Atlanta
You know we'll make it smile
Oh, we love the women
Way down in Tennessee
So baby, come on now, and start a-kissing me


Oh, oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight


Kiss all of Seattle, LA to Baltimore
You know we been kissing in 'Frisco, so let's kiss some more
Let's do it in Detroit, they all know the score
So baby, oh baby, what are we waiting for


Oh, oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight


Oh, oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight


Oh, oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight
