She was all of a lady, you were all of sixteen,
You were king of the mountain, she was your queen.
You played in the sunshine, you danced in the rain,
It was so easy, when love was a game.
But, everybody's


Lovers get older, summer goes away,
You knew that it was over so you looked the other way.
Suddenly before you, your second time around,
Ah, you're older and wiser and you're covering a lot of ground.
But, everybody's



Three times in love.
Two times ain't enough, only one shines above,

Everybody's three times in love.

(Over and over and over again.)
Now that you're ready, she comes along,
Your ways are steady and your feelings are strong.
She is all of your ladies, you are every man.
You've both been waiting to find each other, now you understand
Why everybody's



Three times in love.
Two times ain't enough, only one shines above,
Everybody's three times in love.
