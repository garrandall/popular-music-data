So long sad times
Go along bad times
We are rid of you at last

Howdy gay times
Cloudy gray times
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again

The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again

Altogether shout it now
There's no one
Who can doubt it now
So let's tell the world about it now

Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
From now on...

Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So, Let's sing a song of cheer again


orget your troubles
Come on get happy
You better chase all you cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day

The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
We're going to the promise land

We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

Forget your troubles
Come on get happy
You better chase all you cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day

Forget your troubles
Come on get happy
Chase your cares away
Hallelu get happy
Before the judgement day

The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
We're gonna be going to the promise land

We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's quiet and peaceful on the other side

Forget your troubles
Get happy
Your cares fly away
Shout halleluja
Get happy
Get ready for your judgement day

Come on get happy
Chase your cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day

The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Halleluja
Come on get happy
We're going to the promise land

We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready
For the judgement day


Happy times
Happy nights
Happy days
are here again
Are here again!
