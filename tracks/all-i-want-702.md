All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone who will listen to what I have to say
All I need is some special attention
Someone who will mention the special things in me


I'm not the kind of girl
Who doesn't know what she wants
I see it in my mind
The kind of guy to treat me right
I know he'll be strong
He'll keep me going on
I'll know him when he comes
He'll be my number one


All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone who will listen to what I have to say
All I need is some special attention
Someone who will mention the special things in me


Special in every way
Takes time from busy days
To satisfy my needs
Says things to comfort me
It's not much to ask for
The things I want
I'll know him when he comes
He'll be my number one


All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone who will listen to what I have to say
All I need is some special attention
Someone who will mention the special things in me


All that I'm (All that I'm)
Looking for (looking for)
Got to have (got to have)
Someone mature (oh baby)
Oh everything (everything)
You do and say (do and say)
Touch my heart (touch my heart in a special way)
All I want
All I need
Someone special


All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone who will listen to what I have to say
All I need is some special attention
Someone who will mention the special things in me
