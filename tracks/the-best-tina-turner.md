I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wild
When you come to me, give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby


You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? Baby, I would rather be dead


In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place


You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead


Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go


You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead
You're the best




You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead
You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
Oh, you're the best
