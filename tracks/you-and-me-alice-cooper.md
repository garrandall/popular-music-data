When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete

But you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some lovin'
And TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe
Well that's enough for me

Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
But you just go on dreamin'

If I could take you to heaven
That would make my day complete

But you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some lovin'
And TV, yeah
That's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, sweetheart
That's just enough for me

You and me ain't no super stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some popcorn
And TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe
You're just enough for me

When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I like to hold you squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete

You and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Of lovin'
And TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am well that's what I am
I tell you, baby
That's just enough for me
