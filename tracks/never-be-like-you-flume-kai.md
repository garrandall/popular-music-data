What I would do to take away this fear of being loved
Allegiance to the pain
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
I'll never be like you

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

How do I make you wanna stay?
Hate sleeping on my own, missing the way you taste
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
I'll never be like you
Stop looking at me with those eyes
Like I could disappear and you wouldn't care why
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
I'll never be like you

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

I'm falling on my knees
Forgive me, I'm a fucking fool
I'm begging, darling, please
Absolve me of my sins, won't you?

I'm falling on my knees
Forgive me, I'm a fucking fool
I'm begging, darling, please
Absolve me of my sins, won't you?

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

I'm only human. Can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh
I'll never be like you

Baby, baby, please believe me
C'mon, take it easy
Please don't ever leave me
Never be like you
