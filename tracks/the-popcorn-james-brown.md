Hey you all look out let a man come in 
I got to have fun I'm gonna do my thing 
Way over yonder can you dig that mess 
The sister standing out there dressed up 
In a brand new mini dress 
Look hey over there 
do you see that boy playing that horn 
And dig that soul brother look at him doing the popcorn 

Hey everybody I got a brand new start 
Hey, hey everybody I got a brand new start 
I ain't gonna hurt nobody 
I just, I just I just wanna help my heart 
Gonna have a ball sure as you're born 
Gonna have a ball sure as you're born 
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance do the popcorn 

Hey look a there hey look a there 
Do you see what I see 
Everybody doing the popcorn but me 
Get back over there with your mini dress 
Look out good mama I gotta do my best 
Hey over there hey over there look a here 
A look a here I got the best band in the land 
I just gotta jump back take my stand 
I want to ask the fellows don't have no doubt 
I just got to lay to lay it right out
