If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me, uh-uh-uh


All the things, that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home
Don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue, fuss and fight


If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (No you won't), uh
If you don't know by now
You will never, never, never know me, uh-uh-uh


We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman, you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when we can't see eye to eye


If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (No you won't), uh-uh-uh
If you don't know by now (Youuuu will never, never, never know me)
You will never, never, never know me, uh-uh-uh
(Uh)
If you don't know me by now (Uhhhh)
You will never, never, never know me
