When the world wasn't upside down, I could take all the time I had
But I'm not going to wait when a moment can vanish so fast

'Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the Earth and we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever and all our tomorrows begin
After tonight, we will never be lonely again

Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the Earth and we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
