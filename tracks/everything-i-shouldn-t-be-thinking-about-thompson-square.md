_Verse 1:_
My motorcycle needs an oil change
Fence needs mending, house needs paint
I got a million things that need to be done but
Baby I can only focus on one

_Chorus 1:_
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about

_Verse 2:_
Baby you've always had a one track mind
So what you're saying ain't no surprise
What may come as a shock to you
Is that I'm having all those little thoughts too yea

_Chorus 1:_
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about

_Bridge:_
Baby since you and me are on the same page
Let's do something 'bout it, what do you say, ay?

_Chorus 1:_
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about

_Chorus 2:_
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about
