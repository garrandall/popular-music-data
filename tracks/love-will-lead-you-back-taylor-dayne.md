Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, you stay forever
So if you must go, oh darling, I'll set you free
But I know in time, we'll be together
I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart, I know

Love will lead you back, someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again, it won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

One of these nights, I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, how much you miss me
You walked out this door but someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

Love will lead you back, someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again, it won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back, I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again, it won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

Love will lead you back, someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms, it won't be long
One of these days my love will lead you back
