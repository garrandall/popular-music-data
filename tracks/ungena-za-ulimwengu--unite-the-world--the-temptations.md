Sick minds, sad sights,
Never ending sleepless nights have been accepted as an everyday thing.
Wire tapping, kidnapping...

Will the Russians push the button?

I tell you, people, our thoughts and values have got to change.
They say love is the strongest force on this earth.
Uh, but to me, peace among people surpasses love and worth.
People (jobs don't come no bigger than the one we've got to do.)
If we don't give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?

Think about it.

That's why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend.
This unrest between races has got to come to an end.
Don't let the color of my skin confuse you.
I swear on a stack of bibles I won't misuse you.
So put your (hand in mine.)
Huh, we're gonna form a human chain, mightier than a hurricane.

(And walk this land, hand in hand, day and night, black and white.)
We gotta unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it.

We got to unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Log on to kill this message.
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it with me.

We got to unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
God almighty,. Sing it, sing it, sing it.
Aww, unite the world.

Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Awww.

Oh, ding-dong-ding let the freedom bell ring.
The good Lord made you and me, what he wanted us to be.
Free all those people you got chained up in your (mind.)
Hmmm-mm-hmmm, now there's truth in what I'm saying.
We gotta stop the games we're playing.
Two wrongs ain't never made a right (Right)

Hung up, tripped out, whatever you may be,
Now is the time to set yourself free.
Put your (hand in mine.) Huh, come on.
Oh, and let's walk.

Oh, we gonna...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Sing it with me now...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Raise your voices and sing along with me.

Come on, we gonna unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
We gonna...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)

We gonna unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it.
Aw, come on, come on, come on, come on.

(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
