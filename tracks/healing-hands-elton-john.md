I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land
I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said?
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead


But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again


And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes
I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold


But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again


And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again


And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


(And reach out for her healing hands)
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


Rock me now (come on, come on, come on)


And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


Rock me now
