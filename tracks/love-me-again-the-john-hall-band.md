Something in the stars must be chaning
Something in your heart has to grow
You tell me everything but what you're feeling
After all this time girl I think I know
What you want everyone needs
I only hope you can get it from me

I want you to love me, you to love me
I want you to love me again
I want you to love me, you to love me
I want you to love me again

How could I have taken love for granted
A love that was so sweet and so strong
Maybe you were just too understanding
Before I saw it happening I stayed away too long
And the flame that once burned so high
Barely flickers when I look in your eyes

Day after day I can feel you changing
Turning away from the love we shared
I don't know what kind of man you turned to
I only know how lonely you've been
I don't want to start with someone new girl
I can't stand to think of you with him
And I wonder whether I should see
The secrets you once keeped from me
