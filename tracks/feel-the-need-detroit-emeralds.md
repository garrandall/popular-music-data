See how I'm walkin', see how I'm talkin'
Notice everything in me
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me

I need you by my side to be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide, mmm-mmm
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me

(I need your love)
Ev'ry day I need it (Love), ev'ry day I want it (Love)
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die

(I need your love)
I need it constantly (Love), your love takes care of me (Love)
Your love is better to me than applepie, oooh

Just put your hand in mine, love me all the time
The proof you will plainly see, mmm-mmm
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me

Ah
I need you on the case to keep my heart in place
You make me what I need to be, oooh
Feel the need, oh feel, feel the need in me

Oh, your love is tough, now can't get enough
Girl, your love is so important to me
Feel the need, hey, feel it, feel the need in me

I, I, I, I need you by my side to be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide?
Feel the need, oh feel it, feel the need in me

(I need your love)
Ev'ry day I need it (Love), ev'ry day I want it (Love)
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die

(I need your love)
I need it constantly (Love), your love takes care of me (Love)
Your love is better to me than cherry-pie, oooh

See how I'm walkin', see how I'm talkin'
Notice everything in me
Feel the need, oh, feel it, feel the need in me, ah, oooh

Just put your hand in mine, love me all the time
The proof you will plainly see
Feel the need, hey, feel it, feel the need in me

See how I'm walkin'
See how talkin'
See how I'm walkin'
