What's it all about this crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine?
How do I fit into your life
How did you get into mine?
I belong to someone else we know

Back when first we met
Oh, we thought for fun
One night together might be nice
Oh, but fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price

Oh, 'cause love like ours is never, ever free
You pay some agony for the ecstasy
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy, oh

Nights when you're alone, you know that I
Laid with someone else beside me
Oh, but you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be

Hey, but love like ours is never, ever free
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free
We got to pay some agony if we wanna have ecstasy, oh

Hey, got to pay some agony
If we wanna have an ecstasy, yeah
And we need each other desperately, don't we, baby?
And I'll never from you be free, no no

So you'll have to do the leavin' me, yeah
And you'll have to do the leavin' me, oh baby
'Cause I'm gonna pay the agony, yeah
'Cause, oh, lovin' you is ecstasy, that's what it is

And I'm willin' to pay the price, ho
'Cause I'll make it a sacrifice, ho yes, I will
And I'll never, never, never, never
Never, never wanna be free
