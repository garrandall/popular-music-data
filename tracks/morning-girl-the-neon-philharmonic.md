Morning girl, how'd ya sleep last night?
You're several ages older now
Your eyes have started showing how
The little girls growing now

Morning girl, was that you last night?
Crying on the radio
Begging for a way to go
Where love wasn't jumbled so
Oh, no, things are different now than they were before
You know love is more than kisses
A whole lot more

Morning girl, put your dreams away
And read your box of Cheerios
And powder-puff that pretty nose
And go out and find your man where the wild wind blows
Morning girl
