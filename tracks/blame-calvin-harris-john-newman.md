Can't be sleepin'
Keep on waking
Is that the woman next to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it?
I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby
Yeah (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I got defense
(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I'm sorry
Oh, I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
