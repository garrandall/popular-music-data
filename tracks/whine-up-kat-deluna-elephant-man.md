It's summertime
Ladies lookin' hot
Shaking up what they've got
Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon!


Senses telling me you're looking
I can feel it on my skin (whoa!)
Boy, I wonder what would happen if I trip and let you in
Don't get shook by my aggression, I just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation
Just whine your body up


Ha, ha, ha, don't wanna wait no more
Ha, ha, ha, you got what I'm searching for
I'm feeling your vibing, I'm riding high, it's exotic
And I want you, I want you here
Pull me closer and closer and hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you, I wanna feel you near (oh!)


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!


A ese nene lo tengo trikiao (oye)
Cuando lo bailo lo bailo de lao
Y lo empujo lo tengo tumbao
Con mis caderas lo tengo amansao wind!
Boy, keep doin' what you're doin'
Get me hot
Winding up your body
You don't have to stop
My temperature is rising
Want you more than before
It's an animal attraction
Whine your body up


Ha, ha, ha, it's the magic on the floor
Ha, ha, ha, I don't wanna wait no more
Cause I'm feeling your vibing, I'm riding high it's exotic
And I want you (and I want you too)
I want you here (and I want you too)
Pull me closer and closer (closer and closer)
And hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you too)
I wanna feel you near


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!


Right here, whine up your body
Bring it to me right here
Sheâ€™s got the finest body I fear
Shake off your booty, shake it off in high gear
And she runs her fingers through my hair
And all the black mons got white fear
And she shakes her booty right here
Mow pump up the volume right here


Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (It's rising!)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (Give me the whine now!)
C'mon!


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye! (oye)
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye! (oye)
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye! (oye)
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye! (oye)
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye! (oye)
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up, whine up
Whine up, whine up


Lo cuero
Toca los cueros
Loca e que ta!
