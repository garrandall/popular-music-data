It's summertime
Ladies looking hot
Shaking up what they've got
Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon


Senses telling me you're looking
I can feel it on my skin (Whoa)
Boy I wonder what would happen
If I trip and let you in
Don't get shook by my aggression
I just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation
Just whine your body up

(Ha Ha Ha)
Don't wanna wait no more
(Ha Ha Ha)
You got what I'm searching for


Cause I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high is exotic
And I want you, I want you here
Pull me closer and closer and
Hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you, I wanna feel you near


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!

A ese nene lo tengo trikiao (oye)
Cuando lo bailo lo bailo de lao
Y lo empujo lo tengo tumbao
Con mis caderas lo tengo amansao wind!


Boy keep doing what you're doing get me hot
Winding up your body you don't have to stop
My temperature is rising, want you more than before
It's an animal attraction, whine your body up

(Ha Ha Ha)
It's the magic on the floor
(Ha Ha Ha)
I don't wanna wait no more


Cause I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high is exotic
And I want you (and i want you too), I want you (and I want you too) here
Pull me closer and closer (closer and closer) and
Hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you too), I wanna feel you near


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!


Right here
Whine up your body, bring it to me right here
Sheâs got the finest body I fear
Shake your booty off
Shake it off in high gear
And she runs her fingers through my hair
And all the black mons got white fear
And she shakes her booty right here
Mow pump up the volume right here

(Woah Woah Woah)
It's rising
(Woah Woah Woah)
Give me the whine now

C'mon!


Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!

Lo cuero, toca los cueros
Loca e que ta!!
