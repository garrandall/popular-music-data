Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road straight ahead,
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,
I'll never forget the sound that night.
The screaming tires, the busting glass,
The painful scream that I heard last.



When I woke up, the rain was pouring down,
There were people standing all around.
Something warm flowing through my eyes,
But somehow I found my baby that night.

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said,
"Hold me darling just a little while."
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss,
I found the love that I knew I had missed.

Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,
I lost my love, my life that night.
