Hey, hey, baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl;
Hey, hey, baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl.

When i saw you walking down the street,
I said, "that's the kind of girl i just like to meet."
She's so pretty, lord, she's so fine,
I'm gonna make her mine, mine.

I said, "hey, hey, baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl."

When you turned and walked away,
That's when i wanna say,
"come on, baby, give me a whirl,
I wanna know if you'll be my girl."

I said, "hey, hey, baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl."

When you turned and walked away,
That's when i wanna say,
"come on, baby, give me a whirl,
I wanna know if you'll be my girl."

I said, "hey, hey, baby, - hey, baby!
I wanna know if you'll be my girl."
All right, be my girl.

-"let me hear it one time, boys!"

Hey, (hey, hey) hey baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl.

Hey, (hey, hey) hey baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl.

Hey, (hey) all right, oh!
