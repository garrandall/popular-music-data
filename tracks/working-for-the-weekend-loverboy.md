Everyone's watching to see what you will do
Everyone's looking at you, oh
Everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?
Everyone's trying to get it right, get it right

Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a new romance
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance, oh

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's go
(Oh, oh, oh)

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
Everyone's looking to see if it was you
Everyone wants you to come through
(When will it be Friday
I can't wait for Friday but it's only...)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
Everyone's hoping it'll all work out
Everyone's waiting to hold you out
(Holding up to Friday
Oh thank God it's Friday, I am 'bout to be)

Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a little romance, hey yeah
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance, oh

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's go
(Oh, oh, oh)

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
