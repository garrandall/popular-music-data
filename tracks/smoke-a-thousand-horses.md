She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing alone when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I put her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

She's smoke
I put her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
Like smoke, oh, oh
Like smoke oh, oh

She's smoke
I put her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
The smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
She's smoke, oh, oh
She's smoke, oh, oh
