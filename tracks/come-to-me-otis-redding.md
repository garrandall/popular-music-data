Come to me for I'm lonely
Come to me for I'm lonely, darling
Come to me and be my girl
For I love, love you so


Come to me forget the past
Think of life we have ahead, my my my my baby
Come to me and be my girl
For I love, love, love you so, oh now


Day are getting so lonely, yeah now
Life's so heavy, so blue
Time has come for you and I
To get together and we'll make two, my my my my baby


Come to me for I'm begging
Come to me for I'm begging, darling
Come to me and be my girl
For I love, love, love you so, yeah


Come on now, baby
Baby, I'm down
Said I'm down my knees, oh
I need me someone now
Said I need some love
Just to stand right by me, oh
You know that these arms of mine
They have been lonely, lonely so long
But I know, but I know, I know what my heart needs
I know just what my heart needs, oh
