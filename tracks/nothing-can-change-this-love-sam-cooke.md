If I go, a million miles away
I'd write a letter, each and everyday
Cause honey nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you
Mm, make me weep and you can make me cry
See me coming and you can pass me by
But honey, nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you


Wo-oh-oh, you're the apple of my eye, you're cherry pie
And oh you're, you're cake and ice cream
And oh you're sugar and spice, and everything nice
You're the girl of my, my, my, my, dreams
But if you wanted, to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
Cause honey nothing, nothing, nothing can ever change this, love I have, for you
Wo-oh-oh-oh

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that nothing, nothing, nothing can ever
Change the love I have for you
