Damn, pretty girl you went and done it again
You've gone and turned your sexy all the way up to 10
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a fireball shot
You've got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll


Where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride


You got my heart bump-bumping
When I'm pulling up into your drive
Let's hit it 90 to nothin'
Couple kids running into the night


Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up on inside


Yeah we can run this town
You know I'll rock your world, c'mon
Let's roll, let's ride, let's run this town tonight
Read, set, let's roll
