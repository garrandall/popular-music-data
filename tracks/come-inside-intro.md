(Let me) let me, come inside
(I'll keep you) I'll keep you satisfied, tonight
If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside


I'm thinking about you
The last time we made love
And I fantasize
So many things that I dream of
I wanna do with you baby
And tonight won't be the same
I wanna come inside I like to hear you call my name


(Slowly) I'll give it to you baby
(Only) if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
Grab a hold and love me totally
I wanna slip and slide dip and dive
Do everything to make it alright tonight
Just let me come inside, oh baby


(Let me) let me, come inside
(I'll keep you) I'll keep you satisfied, tonight
If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside


Baby just imagine I can do anything you please
I can set your body on fire, or soothe your soul with ease
Just a kiss, I'll taste your sweet sweet lips
All of the passion I have inside of me
I know you won't forget


(Slowly) I'll give it to you baby
(Only) if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
Grab a hold and love me totally
I wanna slip and slide dip and dive
Do everything to make it alright tonight
Just let me come inside, oh baby


(Let me) let me, come inside
(I'll keep you) I'll keep you satisfied, tonight
If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside


Let me rub you down
(Let me caress you all over your body, baby)
Move-in closer now
(Feel my inner rise)
Hold on tight and don't don't let go
Coming home together baby
