A lot of people called it prison when I was growin up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
Wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning thats full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah

I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place


Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet home Alabama and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and ill be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Yeah I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah small town USA
