The moment I wake up
Before I put my jeans on
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what had you wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Prayer together, together
That's how it will be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for my horse dear
While riding it I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together, together
That's how it will be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

My darling believe me
The (my darling believe me)
For me there is no one
But you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Little forever, forever
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together, together
That's how it will be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
