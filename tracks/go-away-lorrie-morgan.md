Touche, touche
You're right, there's nothing I can say
I am a wishy washy girl
But it's a wishy washy world


Go away
No, wait a minute
I want out
Then I want in it
I'm all confused but I admit it
Go away
No, wait a minute


C'est la vie, la vie
That's what you get when you get me
I have the right to change my mind
At least a couple hundred times


Go away
No, wait a minute
I want out
Then I want in it
I'm all confused but I admit it
Go away
No, wait a minute




I need some help
I'm not quite myself
And lately I'm a nervous wreck
My whole world has changed
And the reason I'm strange
Is I love you and baby that scares me to death


Go away
No, wait a minute
I want out
Then I want in it
I'm all confused but I admit it
Go away
No, wait a minute


I'm all confused but I admit it
Go away
No, wait a minute
