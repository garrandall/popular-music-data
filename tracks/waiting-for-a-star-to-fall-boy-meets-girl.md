I'm just a boy
Sleepin' in a, sleepin' in a, sleepin' in a
A bed of roses
And she's just a girl
Swimmin' in a, swimmin' in a, swimmin' in a
A dirty ocean

See I picked a flower, and I walked on water
I love you so much, I even met your father
And you ran through meadows, and you shaved your head
And you laid your body upon my rosebed

See, springtime is coming, and soon we will blossom
And bouquets look best, only when they are watered
Let's meet between the gender, now wouldn't that be awesome?

See I'm a boy, boy, boy (ooh)
And you're a girl, girl, girl (ooh)
See you're a boy, boy, boy (ooh)
And I'm a girl, girl, girl (ooh)
Wait!

Let's be quiet for a second
I wanna hear that beat, your heart is bumpin' girl, your essence
Is something like the pinkest sky
Grab them puffy clouds and cover them with hippy colored dye
Purple rain, ain't that insane?
I bet you seen that coming like a million miles away (that's real)
I wear my beanie in the winter just like Marvin Gaye
And if the sky is gray (gray)
I know you find a way (that's real)
To bring the sun out
'Cause yellow brings the fun out, and summer brings the buns out
And now we back to fall
The place that we begin
I was sleeping in the roses, in the meadows where you call
You said that you were looking for a boy to be your all (and what)
And that is what you found (okay)
Now welcome to the blossom street
The place that we get down (get down)
And speaking of profound
Your shaved head is round (that's real)
I wonder if you knew that's my favorite type (type)
Sleepin' up under the stars is where we lay tonight

I'm just a boy (haven't you ever seen a boy like me?)
Sleepin' in a, sleepin' in a, sleepin' in a
A bed of roses
And she's just a girl (I been looking for you)
Swimmin' in a, swimmin' in a, swimmin' in a
A dirty ocean (I been looking for you too)

See you brought me seeds, planted my fill
'Cause they never seen a boy plant flowers on a hill
But you would never judge, and therefore you are real
You got grass, let it up, blow the windmill

See, springtime is coming, and soon we will blossom
And bouquets look best, only when they are watered
Let's meet between the gender, now wouldn't that be awesome?

See I'm a boy, boy, boy
Boy (no matter what they say)
And you're a girl, girl, girl
Girl (do it anyway)
See you're a boy, boy, boy
Boy (no matter what you say)
And I'm a girl, girl, girl
Girl (I do it anyway)
See I'm a boy, boy, boy (no matter what they say)
And you're a girl, girl, girl (I do it anyway)
See you're a boy, boy, boy (no matter what they say)
And I'm a girl, girl, girl (I do it anyway)
