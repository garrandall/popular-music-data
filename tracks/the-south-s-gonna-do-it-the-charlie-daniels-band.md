Well, the train to Grinderswitch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Carolin'
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
And people down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

So gather round
Gather round, children
Get down
Well, just get down children
Get loud
Well, you can be loud here and
Be proud
You can be proud here
Now be proud to be a Rebel 'cause the South's gonna do it again
(And again)

Elvin Bishop sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin', but he sure can play
And, there's ZZ Top, and you can't forget
That old brother Will is gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' barefoot Jerry and the CDB

Well, gather round
Gather round, children
Get down
Well, you can get down children
Get loud
Well, you can get loud here and
Be proud
You can be proud here
Now be proud to be a Rebel 'cause the South's gonna do it again
(Yes it is)
