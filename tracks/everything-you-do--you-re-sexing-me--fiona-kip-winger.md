Ooh you're sexing me
Ooh you're sexing me
Baby, baby, baby come on

You take it slow
I keep hanging on
You tease me
You've got me begging and out of control
You make love look so easy

I can't sleep
(Got the fever)
At night
(Must be dreaming)
I can't breathe
(I'm on fire)
And I'm burning bright
Light a candle
(Be my lover)
It's time
(Come on closer)
To feel, feel the heat

Ooh you're sexing me
Everything you do just turns me on
Ooh you're sexing me
I can feel it coming on
Oh oh oh, baby

Where can I run
Where can I hide
You follow me from the inside
Rock of ages, a heart built for one
All going down in a landslide

To the river
(Bring me water)
Of love
('Til I'm drowning)
Let's come together
(Even closer)
'Cause you're in my blood
It's a rhythm
(Cinderella)
My love
(It's now or never)
So feel, feel the beat

Ooh you're sexing me
Oh you know I'm gonna get you
Ooh you're sexing me
Baby, 'cause I want to let you

The sun
(Darkness, darkness)
Won't shine
(All around me)
Until you
(Look out your window)
Put your heart with mine
You should know
(I'll be waiting)
By now
(Don't keep me waiting)
There's no way out, no way out

Ooh you're sexing me
Everything you do just turns me on
Ooh you're sexing me
Baby, baby, baby come on

Oh oh oh, baby
Ooh you're sexing me
Everything you do, everything you say
Ooh you're sexing me
Don't you know it's time to be crazy
Ooh you're sexing me
Oh you're sexing me, baby
Baby, you're driving me crazy
