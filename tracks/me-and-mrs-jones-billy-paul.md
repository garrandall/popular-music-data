Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down now

We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Mrs. Jones got a thing going on, we both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down now
We gotta be extra careful that we don't build our hopes too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations and so do I

Me, me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Mrs. Jones got a thing going on, we both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down now
Well, it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside

Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
But tomorrow we'll meet the same place, the same time
Me and Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
