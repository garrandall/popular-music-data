I told her, "Fuck that nigga"
Woop-woop, uh
(Mustard on the beat, ho)


I don't know your name, but you heard my name (Whoa)
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga" (I don't know ya)


We sittin' in the back of the club (Yeah)
Table got a rope in the front, I don't know ya
Uh, you lookin' real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a Goddamn shame (Whoa)
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just sayin' if you got a man back home, I don't know him (I don't know him)
What? Just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush (Wait)
Walk on green, I could even hear the putt (Oh)
K.O. shawty when I hit her with a punchline (Ah)
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time (Uh)
Duckin' from my ex like a one time (Woop-woop)
Throw a sign when you really tryna go
Got the car parked right at the door (Uh)


I don't know your name, but you heard my name (Whoa)
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga" (I don't know ya)


Nah, and you don't know my name (No)
Just in case you the feds, I don't know ya (Oh)
Uh, I might'a poured you a drink (What?)
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you came, tryna be my main chick (Yeah)
Passenger side when I lane switch
Top back, two seats only (Uh)
Ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them (I don't know them)
We just seizin' the moment
Up all night, throw a deuce to the mornin' (Walt)
Fly motherfucker, everythin' is imported (Walt)
Don't try to act too important, I know your game
You got a gang of niggas
All over you, but you all over here (Woop-woop), on me (On me)
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya
Bad bitch only thing I'll call you (Uh)


I don't know your name, but you heard my name (Whoa)
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
(Girl, I know you wanna be)
My main chick (Yeah)
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
('Cause you're my main)
I told her, "Fuck that nigga"


Baby, why you playin'? You heard my name (Yeah)
(Let me see that curvy body) I know why you came
She gon' gimme that brain so we can do our thang
Let's do that thang (Tell 'em)
What you think about me takin' you down here? (Woo)
I can be your man when he's not around, yeah (Woo, uh)


I don't know your name, but you heard my name (Whoa)
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga"
