You got the gas, I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild, you got the crazy
You know that's why I love you, baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

People talk, girl, you know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give 'em something they ain't never seen
A little rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset, baby
'Cause we ain't dead yet, baby

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here

We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah, we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here
