Uh huh... (one)
Uh... it's another... (one)
I am the... (one)
Darkchild... (one)

Them oher girl's you done been with
None of them got nothing on me
Hating on my style they aint got nothing on me... nothing on me
Way I walk, the way I talk, my swagga... look around; every dude wanna have her
I ain't saying that I'm the best, but I'm the best, hey baby you need that

Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
(Hey I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm her)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm her)...

Let me break it down if you don't get it, quality,
I'm custom fitted, imma say it again, dey aint got nothing on me, nothing on me (me)
Way I walk, the way I talk, my swagga... boy you know every boss wanna have her
I ain't saying that I'm the best, but I'm the best, hey baby you need that

Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
Stop looking for it, looking for it, I'm the (one)
(Hey I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm that)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm her)...Boy don't you know I'm the one,
(Yea I'm her)...

Uh Oh... ok I got these girls quite hype, only thing on right now, like a night light,
While my brother Wayne rockin' out like a white stripe, imma kill the game,
I'm the young money white night (white night)...Yeah
Plus I'm looking for the right type cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
West put me on the mart, keep life light plus I go hard for the women that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger so if you wanna keep your girl please don't bring her
I bet that I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for, You would block me but this aint jinga
Yeah... and she someone I would work with, that's what I could tell from what she's showing on the surface.
I aint saying that I'm requesting anyone that's perfect but I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it...

Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock,
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock,
This that knock, knock, knock, knock, knock...
This that knock, knock, knock, knock, knock...

I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
