I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, and they're sayin'

There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They was just the gigolos
Life goes on without me

I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part Dave's playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what they're sayin'

There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me, 'cause

I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody
Nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad

Better love me, babe
Sad and lonesome, all of the time
Even on the beat, on the, on the, on the beat
Bop, boze-de-boze-de-bop, se-de-bop

I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody
Nobody, hey, say

Feelin' so sad and lonesome

Ain't got nobody
Woohoo, sad and lonesome
Need love
Humala bebuhla zeebuhla boobuhla
Humala bebuhla zeebuhla bop

I ain't got nobody
Nobody, nobody cares for me, nobody, nobody
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad

Been a lonely soul
Been lonesome all of the time
Even on the beat
Johnny, Johnny on the beat
Need a long tall darling, mama
David said he got nobody I loves

Ain't got nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody)
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody)
No one (no one), no one (no one)
Loop-de-loop (loop-de-loop)
Darling, darling (darling, darling)
Getting serious (getting serious)
Got to see the walls (got to see the walls)
Over there (over there)
Nobody (nobody), not no one (not no one)
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody)
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody)
Nobody (nobody)
Nobody cares for me
