"God Bless America"
By Irving Berlin

While the storm clouds gather far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
Raise our voices in a solemn prayer

God Bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God Bless America, my home sweet home
God Bless America, my home sweet home
