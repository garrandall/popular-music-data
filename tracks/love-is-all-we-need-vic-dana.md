(Love is, oh love is, oh

Love is all we need
So won't you take me
In your arms and love me
Love me

Love is all we need
So, darling, press me
To your heart and love me
Love me

Tell me we'll always
Have each other
Cause that's all I
Ever want to know

Tell me there'll never be another
Cause I will always want you so

Love is all we need to make
Our every dream come true
So, love me, love me
All we ever, ever need is love

(Love is, love is, ah)

Tell me we'll always
Have each other
Cause that's all I
Ever want to know

Tell me you'll always be my lover
Cause I will always want you so

Love is all we need to make
So, darling, hold me close to you
And love me, love me
All we ever, ever need is love
