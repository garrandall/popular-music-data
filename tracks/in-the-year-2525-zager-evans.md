In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

In the year 3535
Can't tell the truth, can't tell no lie
Everything you think, do and say
Is in the pill you took today

In the year 4545
Won't need no teeth, won't need your eyes
Won't find a thing to do
Nobody's gonna look at you

In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your side
Your legs have nothing to do
Some machines doin' that for you

In the year 6565
Won't need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your sons, pick your daughters too
From the bottom of a long glass tube wouwo

In the year 7510
If god is commin' he should make it by then
Maybe he'll look around and say:
"Now it's time for the judgement day!"

In the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty hand
He'll leave a salient place where man has been
Or tear it down and start again wouwo

In the year 9595
I'm wondering if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything earth had to give
And he's put back nothing wouwo

Now it's been 10.000 years man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew now man's reign is through
But through eternal light the twinklin' of starlight
So very far away now it's night to yesterday

In the 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find...

In the year 3535
Won't tell the truth tell no lies
Everything you think do and say
Is in the pill you took today

In the year 4545...
