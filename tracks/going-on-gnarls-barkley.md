Iâve seen it with my own eyes
How weâre gettinâ otherwise 
Without the luxury of leavinâ
The touch and feeling of free is 
Untangible technically 
Something youâve got to believe in
Connect the cause and effect 
One foot in front of the next 
This is the start of a journey. 
And my mind is already gone 
And though there are other unknowns
Somehow this doesnât concern me.

And you can stand right there if you want
But Iâm going on 
And Iâm prepared to go it alone
Iâm going on
To a place in the sun thatâs nice and warm
Iâm going on

And Iâm sure theyâll have a place for you too oohoohoo

Anyone that needs what they want, and doesnât want what they need 
I want nothing to do with
And to do what I want 
And to do what I please 
Is first of my to-do list
But every once in a while I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss
But baby Iâve to go
Baby Iâve got to know
Baby Iâve got to prove it

And Iâll see you when you get there
But Iâm going on
And Iâm prepared to go it alone
Iâm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
Iâm going on
And I promise Iâll be waiting for you oohoohoo
