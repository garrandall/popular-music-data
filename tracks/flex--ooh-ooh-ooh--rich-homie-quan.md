Walked in 30,000 in my pocket
Had them boys just like "ooh, ooh, ooh!"
50 thousand dollars on ya chick wanna do it
Got her screamin' like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Cause I got a check, brother wanna flex
I ain't gotta flex, boy I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Give that girl some x, she gon wanna get every brother in the set
Got her screaming like ooh, ooh, ooh

Made 2 million dollars off a mixtape
Had them folks like ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey! Hey!)
They tried to drop me with a case but you know but I had done skated
I was singing like ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy I know my role and I play it (Yes I do!)
If you heard that I'm talkin' then I said it
Will where you at?
At the top of the loft these where I stay
I'm a bad boy but I don't wear big clothes like Ma$e

In the club I get it boppin'
And that girl, she want a free drink, tell that chick to get up off me
I'm the dude to get it poppin', her hair short like Dennis Rodman
At the Clearport boy, we flying, when I landed boy I...

30,000 in my pocket
Had them boys just like "ooh, ooh, ooh!"
50 thousand dollars on ya chick wanna do it
Got her screamin' like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Cause I got a check, brother wanna flex
I ain't gotta flex, boy I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Give that girl some x, she gon wanna get every brother in the set
And now she screamin' like ooh, ooh, ooh!

(How much you made?) A $100, 000
(How much, how much you made?) A $100, 000
(How much, how much you made?)
Made two million dollars off a mixtape, had them folks like ohhh
Hey, get at me
