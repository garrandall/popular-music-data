Hey, oh, there it is, there it is, there it is
There it is, there it is (Rich Homie, baby!)


Walked in, thirty thousand in my pocket
Had them niggas just like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
50,000 dollars on your bitch, wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
I ain't gotta flex, boy I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Give that ho some x, she gon' wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like "Ooh, ooh, ooh"


(How much you made?) Made two million dollars off a mixtape
And I'm fucking like, ooh, ooh, ooh
They try to drop me with a case but you know I had done skated
I was singing like, ooh, ooh, ohh
Boy, I know my role and I play it
If you heard that I'm talking, then I said it
(Quan where you at?) At the top of the loft nigga, I stay
I'm a bad boy but I don't wear big clothes like Ma$e
In the club and a nigga get it boppin'
And that ho, she want a free drink, tell the bitch to get up off me
I'm the nigga to get it poppin', her hair short like Dennis Rodman
At the Clearport nigga, we flying, when I landed, boy I


Walked in, thirty thousand in my pocket
Had them niggas just like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
$50,000 on your bitch, wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
I ain't gotta flex, boy I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Give that ho some x, she gon' wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"


(How much you made?) $100,000 just in two days
(Guess what?) I don't fuck with niggas cause they two-faced
(That's right, that's right)
I only fuck with bitches for their toupee (Their top, nigga)
These Givenchys, I ain't worried about no new Jays
Know this bitch who got a sack and she always got my back
So I love that shit the most
I'm her big dog and she my cat, and she love it from the back
Call her green cause she on go (Green light)
I wear glasses cause I know these niggas watchin'
They mad cause they cannot stop me
Boy stopping is not a option, I can't help it cause I got it
Don't waste time, I got six watches
Talkin' Rolex, yeah, I bought 'em
Now I'm at the top, started from the bottom, then I


Walked in, thirty thousand in my pocket
Had them niggas just like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
$50,000 on your bitch, wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
I ain't gotta flex, boy I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Give that ho some x, she gon wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"


(How much you made?) $100,000
(How much, how much you made?) $100,000
(How much, how much you made?)
Made two million dollars off a mixtape, had them folks like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Hey, get at me
