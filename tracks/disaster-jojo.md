I'm trying not to pretend
That it won't happen again and again like that
I never thought it would end
'Cause you got up in my head, in my head like that


And made me happy, baby
Love is crazy, so amazing
But it's changing, re-arranging
I don't think I can take anymore


'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster
Oh whoa


I didn't want it this way
I only wanted to say I loved you right
But now you're walking away nd leaving me here to stay
So foolish of me to wait for you


To realize all the things I gave you
Made you, changed you
Your dreams came true when I met you
Now forget you, don't want anymore


'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always (and always)
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster


You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heartbeat and now it's dying
I been through it, I-I been through all the agony
And now my eyes are drying, trying, no more crying
Lying's just a game
So disaster strikes and I'm alright
'Cause my love's on its way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Burning up forever and always, always
Yeah, yeah, yeah


'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never (and now we're saying never)
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day (our way)
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground (ohooh
No happy ever after, just disaster, whoa oh whoa...


'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never (whoa oh)
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always (yeah)
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day (just disaster)
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby (ohoohhoh
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster


Just disaster, whoa
Burning up for forever and always, always
Yeah, yeah
