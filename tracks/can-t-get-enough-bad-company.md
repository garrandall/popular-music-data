Well, I take whatever I want
And baby, I want you
You give me something I need
Now tell me I got something for you

Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on and-uh do what you do

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Listen

Well, it's late and I want love
Love that's gonna break me in two
Don't you hang me up in your doorway
Don't you hang up like you do

Say it
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on, come on, do what you do, Woo!

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Well I say now

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Say it again, aah
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

I've got to tell ya baby, that I
I love you so much I can't get enough of your love
I love you so much I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Mmm, you know what I'm saying baby
I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough, enough of your love
I can't get enough, enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love, Yeah
Woo! Ah, come on baby
Come over here right now
Oh oh oh oh...
