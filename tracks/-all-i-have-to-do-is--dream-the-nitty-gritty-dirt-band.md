When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do, is dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time, night or day

Only trouble is
Gee wiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so, and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time, night or day

Only trouble is
Gee wiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so, and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream
