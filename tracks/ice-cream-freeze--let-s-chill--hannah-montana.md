Alright!
Here we go!
Follow me now!
Come on! Hit it!

Everybody do your dance
Ain't nothing better than an all-out jam.
No!
Are you ready for a little something new tonight
I got a brand-new step I think you're gonna like
Come on, boys!

Gotta do like I do. Just follow my lead
Everybody let's chill
Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Shake it. Shake it, shake it. Shake it, shake it, shake it down low.
And do the ice-cream freeze. Ha.

All kind of stepping make make you feel good
(make you feel real good)
Triple step, butterfly sugar foot
(shake it, shake it, shake it)
But I'm coming up with a new thing what you need
(that's right)
Now everybody wanna do the ice-cream freeze
Come on, boys!

Gotta do like I do. Just follow my lead
Everybody let's chill

Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
And we can party all night

Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Party all night!
Did I hear someone say "party"! (party)
We're just getting started
Wanna take it from the top? Well, you know I will
Now, everybody, let's chill

Lights, camera, freeze
Everybody, let's go!

Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Do the ice-cream freeze, strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it down low
Do the snow-cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Do the ice-cream freeze
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
(snow-cone slide) then do the snow-cone slide
Put your hands in the air
Go crazy!
Everybody, let's chill!
