Someone to count on in a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you standing
What you need is a lover, someone to take over
Oh baby don't look any further

Strange when you think of the chances
That we've both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless, looking for the right thing
Oh baby don't look any further

Tonight (tonight) we're gonna taste a little paradise
Rock you all night long
Daylight (daylight) I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
And we'll go on and on and on and on


Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further. don't you look no further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further

Someone to count on in a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you standing
What you need is a lover to love you all over
Oh baby don't look any further (further)

Tonight (tonight) we're gonna taste a little paradise
Rock you night long
Daylight (daylight) I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
We'll go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
