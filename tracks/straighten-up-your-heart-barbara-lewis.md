Your cheating heart was playing from the start
& our love's becoming the talk of the town
I can't live up to misery & pain
That I'm about to face, my tears would fall like rain
'Cause I have been too lonely
One day soon, let me go
It's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt me so inside
So if you don't wanna, don't want to see my cry
Please don't ever ever say goodbye
Just straighten up your heart
& we can start anew
& if you do this for me
I'll know your lovin' is true

So straighten up your heart
& we can start anew
& if you do this for me
I'll know your lovin' is true
Baby I'll know your love is true
Darlin', I'll know your love is true, so true
