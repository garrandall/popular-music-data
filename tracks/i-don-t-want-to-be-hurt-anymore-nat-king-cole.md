I don't want to be hurt anymore
By a part-time love affair
And I don't want to cry like before
Why pretend, again, you care

Please don't coax me back into your arms
I've been fooled many times by your charms
I know if I kissed you, I might not resist you
I don't want to be hurt anymore

Please don't coax me back into your arms
I've been fooled many times by your charms
I know if I kissed you, I might not resist you
I don't want to be hurt anymore
