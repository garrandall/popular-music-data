I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come


When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching tear-drops in my hand


My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever


Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone


My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever


Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
