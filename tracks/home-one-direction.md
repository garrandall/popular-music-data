Make a little conversation, so long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over, told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes


I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh) with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh) Baby, we could be enough


And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home


So hot that I couldn't take it, wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling, I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes


I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh) with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh) Baby, we could be enough


And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
I'll make this feel like home
Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
