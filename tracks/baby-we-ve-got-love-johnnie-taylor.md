A crazy little smile
Everybody's got a smile
But if we get together
And they smile when I hold you
Then we've got love

Tell you that (we've got love)
So much love (we've got love)
We've got (we've got love)
So much love (we've got love)
Now if we get together
And they smile when I hold you
Then we've got love

One more thing
You've got lips
Such pretty little lips
Everybody's got lips
But if you kiss me back
When I kiss your pretty lips, baby
Then we've got love

I keep-a tellin' you that (we've got love)
So much love (we've got love)
Oh (we've got love)
We've got a love babe (we've got love)
Now if you kiss me back
When I kiss your pretty lips, baby
Then we've got love

Now listen
You've got a heart
I know you've got a heart
Because everybody's got a heart
Now listen
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love

But oh (we've got love)
We've got love (we've got love)
So much love baby (we've got love)
You know we got love (we've got love)
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love

I wanna tell you 'bout it (we've got love)
So much love (we've got love)
Baby got love (we've got love)
Oh yeah (we've got love)
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love
