Sometimes a love won't let go
Hard as I try I know it shows
Everybody's telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I supposed to feel so secure

When I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes somehow
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now

The letter started with goodbye
I've read it half a million times
Tell me this is just a dream
When I wake up she'll be here next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was, oh

Well I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now

Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
(Whoa whoa whoa!)
Who's holding Donna now
(Oh Donna)
What magic can be found
To make me the one,
Who's holding Donna now
I can't get Donna off my mind
Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
