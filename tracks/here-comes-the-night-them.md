Whoa, here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa-whoa-whoa-yeah

I could see right out my window
Walkin' down the street, my girl
With another guy

His arm around her
Like it used to be with me
Whoa, it makes me want to die-i

Yeah-yeah-yeah
Well, here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-yeah

There they go
It's funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me?
Why can't I, accept the fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?
Whoa-whoa-whoa

Well, here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa-whoa-whoa-yeah

She's with him
He's turning down the lights
And now he's holding her
The way I used to do

I could see, her closing her eyes
And tellin' him lies
Exactly like she told me, too
Yeah-yeah-yeah

Well, here it comes
Here comes the night
The long, the long and lonely night
Night, night, night, night, night, night

Whoa, here comes the night
The long, the long, the long and lonely night
