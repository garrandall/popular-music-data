So here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
And you made a promise to yourself
That you were never gonna be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on driving faster into the sun

Cause everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes

Don't have to find your own way out
You gotta voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead end road
There's always somewhere left to turn

So don't give up now
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are and if you just can bear to be alone
I'll stay

Cause everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes

Well, maybe I been too caught up to see
What you've been going through and all that I can say is

Oooo, yeah

And everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
A little left to save
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Gotta have someone beside you
Gotta have someone beside you
Yes, ya do, yes, ya do
Everybody, everybody needs somebody sometimes
