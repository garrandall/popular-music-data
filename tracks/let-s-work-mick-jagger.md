No sitting down on your butt
The world don't owe you
No sitting down in a rut
I wanna show you
Don't waste your energy
On making enemies
Just take a deep breath
And work your way up

Let's work, be prou
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty

La, la, la
Work your way up

Let's work, be prou
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty

You're sitting down on your butt
And your get greedy
You start to lose your nuts
Don't you look seedy
Can generosity bring you humility
So take a deep breath

Ain't gonna sweat for you
Ain't gonna sigh for you
Ain't gonna cry for you
If you're lazy

Ain't gonna slave for you
Ain't gonna hurt for you
It just won't work for you
If you're lazy

Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Let's work, let's eat
Let's live in ecstasy
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty

Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, let's work
Get down in the dirt and let's work
Get down in the dirt and let's work
Get up, be free
Get down in the dirt, let's work
Get down in the dirt, let's work
Get down in the dirt
Take off your shirt
Get down in the dirt
Let's work
