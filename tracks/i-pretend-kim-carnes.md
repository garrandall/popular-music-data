Time hasn't healed the wound
I wish I was in her shoes
She's got the man I could never have
My kisses were never missed
How it hurts to be second best
Oh let me tell you what I have to do
To get through the night

I pretend that you're loving me after dark
Pretend that you're holding me next to your heart
Pretend that you wanted me right from the start
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy
I pretend that your valentine is for me
Pretend that I'm the only one that you need
Pretend that we're making love in our dreams
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy

Memories that should have died
Come alive when you walk on by
I wish my eyes could turn away
For this heart there is no escape
When the truth is too hard to take
Oh let me tell you what I have to do
To get through the night

I pretend that you're loving me after dark
Pretend that you're holding me next to your heart
Pretend that you wanted me right from the start
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy
I pretend that your valentine is for me
Pretend that I'm the only one that you need
Pretend that we're making love in our dreams
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy

I pretend that you're loving me after dark
Pretend that you're holding me next to your heart
Pretend that you wanted me right from the start
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy
I pretend that your valentine is for me
Pretend that I'm the only one that you need
Pretend that we're making love in our dreams
Oh I'm lost in my fantasy
