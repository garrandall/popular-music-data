Went into the GNC
Told them what was wrong with me
I thought that they might have a cure
They said, 'see your doctor'
The doctor said, it's plain to see
You suffer a deficiency
The problem is, son, I can't fill
The prescription for your ill, he said

If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
Vitamin L

It makes all things well, Vitamin L

Then proceeded to describe
This vitamin he can't prescribe
A chemical reaction occurs
Every time that boy meets girl
Its healing power's so complete
There is no drug that could compete, no
But we just can't seem to devise
Any way to synthesize it, say

If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
Vitamin L

Has to occur in love like dreams
And now I know just what he means
All that had been bothering me
Has been cleared up completely
All this time, she's all I needed
What a great way to get treated
Take this advice and you'll feel great
Even if you're not sick, why wait? It says

If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
If you could buy, I'm sure they'd sell Vitamin L
Vitamin L

It makes all things well, Vitamin L
It makes all things well
