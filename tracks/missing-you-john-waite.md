Every time I think of you 
I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here 
And you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 
I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time 
Thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 
I ain't missing you at all 
Since you've been gone 
Away 
I ain't missing you 
No matter 
What I might say 
There's a message 
In the wild 
And I'm sending you 
this signal tonight 
You don't know 
How desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world 
I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard 
to understand 
And it's my heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 
I ain't missing you at all 
Since you've been gone 
Away 
I ain't missing you 
No matter 
What my friends say 
And there's a message that I'm sending out 
Like a telegraph to your soul 
And if I can't bridge this distance 
Stop this heartbreak overload 
I ain't missing you at all 
Since you've been gone 
Away 
I ain't missing you 
No matter 
What my friends say 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I keep lying to myself 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 
I ain't missing you at all 
Since you've been gone 
Away 
I ain't missing you 
No matter 
What my friends say 
Ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I keep lying to myself 
Ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
I ain't missing you 
Ain't missing you 
Oh no 
No matter what my friends might say 
I ain't missing you
