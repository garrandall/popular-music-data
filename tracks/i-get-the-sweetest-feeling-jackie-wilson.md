The closer you get
The better you look
baby

The better you look
The more I want you

When you turn on your smile I feel my heart go wild

I'm like a child with a brand-new toy.
And I get the sweetest feeling

Honey
The sweetest - sweetest feeling -
Baby
The sweetest - sweetest feeling - loving you
yeah!

The warmer your kiss
The deeper you touch me
Baby

The deeper your touch
the more you thrill me

It's more than I can stand
Girl
When you hold my hand

I feel so grand that I could cry.

And I get the - sweetest feeling
Mama
The sweetest - sweetest feeling
Baby
The sweetest - sweetest feeling - loving you.

The greater your love
The stronger you hold me
Baby

The stronger your hold
The more I need you.
With every passing day I love you more in every way

I'm in love to stay and I wanna say.

I get the - sweetest feeling
Baby
The sweetest - sweetest feeling -
Honey't the sweetest - sweetest feeling - loving you.
