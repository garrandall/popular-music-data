Fly like an eagle through the sky
Makin more money than you can and I don't try
I'm on that level
That money makin rebel
Checkin for my pay no way
Can I settle for less than the best
When you make that purchase
And all my material needs will surface
Thats the only way I swang
Watch the way I do my thang


I can do anything
I wanna do in my life
You, you know you like the way
I kick my game
I'm not ashamed to do my thing
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want


Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing


Lady I'd do almost anything for you
Anything your heart desires
It's easy to fulfill your needs
Because you believe in me
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want

Yo Batman and Romeo, give me the mic so I can flow
LDB make it funky from here to Mexico
I can do it fast or slow it really doesn't matter though
Cause I'm a pro; What you say, you wanna take me toe to toe?
Uh...no, dude I don't think so
My crew is strapped, my style is phat
And Immature's got my back on this funky track
You want fries with that?
Coo-Coo-Cachoo what you gonna do, hoooh

Welcome to the hip hop, the home of hip hop
You don't stop the way we rock, yo Batman
24/7 around the clock, this is Ed here from Good Burger
Are you shocked, whoa!
Watch me do my thang, hoooh
