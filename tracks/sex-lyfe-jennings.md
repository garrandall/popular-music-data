Alright alright alright y'all settle down settle down settle down.

If you don't know where you are this is Statistics 101
And I'm your teacher Lyfe Jennings in the flesh baby.

Books out. Let's go!

25% of all men are unstable
25% of all men can't be faithful
30% of them don't mean what they say
And 10% of the remaining 20 is gay

That leaves you a 10% chance of ever finding your mate
That means you better pay attention to these words that I say

I'm gonna teach you how expose the 90%
And show you what to do to keep the other 10.

Rule #1
Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

Rule #2
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Rule #3
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it

Rule #4
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime

Statistics!

15% of all men got a complex
15% of all men don't practice safe sex
20% of them come from homes without a father
And there's a 50/50 chance that you'll marry a coward

Something to think about when you're taking a shower
Something to swallow when you're drinking bottled water

I'm gonna teach you how to expose the 90%
And show you what to do to keep the other 10

Rule #1
Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

Rule #2
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Rule #3
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it

Rule #4
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime

Statistics

Be patient! He's waiting!
You don't gotta settle for that
Leave all that stress alone!
Get you a backbone!
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!

Chances make champions
It's gonna take patience
Time is still wastin'

Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

Rule #2
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Rule #3
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it.

Rule #4
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime.
