I didn't cry
I just stood and watched her say goodbye
She closed the door
And said I don't want to see you anymore

Things I should have said to her
That maybe would have changed her mind to stay
Things I should have said to her
Like girl, I love you so let love find a way

Was it that she
Just couldn't understand a man like me
Was I to blame
Did I leave too many things unexplained?

Things I should have said to her
That maybe would have changed her mind to stay
Things I should have said to her
Like girl, I love you so let love find a way

Why didn't I try telling her
She was all I had
Why didn't I try telling her
Now she's gone and I feel oh so bad

I didn't cry
I just stood and watched her say goodbye
She closed the door
And said I don't want to see you anymore
Things I should have said to her
