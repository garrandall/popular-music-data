Hold, hold up, hold up
Slow, slow down
Listen, give me 10 minutes
Well, give me 5 minutes...a'ight
B-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes


Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town
I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing
When it's gotta be something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
'Cause I don't know what the hell happened
I come in the house to try to work it out
And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn, what could be the reason
Baby talk to me I'm almost out of time


I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do
To prove to you that I'm gon' do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay
And show you that I done changed
'Cause in 4 minutes
I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes
I'm a lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clock's ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go


Who are these people I don't know in my house?
And they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin'
That you can't keep it real with me?
Is it cause of the prior relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking
And you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe
The only one for me, yeah
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time
I only got 4 minutes
I only got 4 minutes

4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
Cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Only got 4 minutes to tell you everything I love about you
4 minutes to say I need you, I can't live without you
I'm out of time gotta say what's on my mind
Just to keep you in my life
Aw, damn I'm outta time
