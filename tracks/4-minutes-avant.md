Y'all know what time it is... It's the ColliPark remix. Yo Avant! Let's beat they back out


I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do, prove to you
That I'm gone do anything
I only got 4 minutes to say what I gotta say, to make you stay
And show you that I'm gone change
Cause in 4 minutes, I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes, I'm gonna lose her to some other man
Four... no less, no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks tickin'
I got 4 minutes to go


I only got a couple minutes to spit it to make you feel it
And tell ya how you could be livin' tellin' if ya kick it
You make me feel like I should take it easy on the pimpin'
You sure got everything I need and I ain't even trippin', really
So if you wanna run away with Krazie, just let me know
Time is steady tickin', baby we've got to go
Time just won't give me time, but if you ride time I will find, yeah yeah


Should I just let it sit and marinate?
All the things that we shared were so great
Stuck in a hard place, tryna to say face it, yeah... (like a pimp)
Never said I was an angel, never thought that you would leave though
Now its funny to me how the situation change though and I'm
Callin' you every minute every second on the hour the clock is tickin'
(Yo, what up baby? Um, its me. Holla at me now, aight? Come on now)
I'm callin' you every minute every second on the hour the clock is tickin'
(Yo, this some bullshit, you need to answer the phone, for real)

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do, prove to you
That I'm gone do anything
I only got 4 minutes to say what I gotta say, to make you stay
And show you that I'm gone change
Cause in 4 minutes, I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes, I'm gonna lose her to some other man
Four... no less, no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks tickin'
I got 4 minutes to go


Yo, when it comes to the times that we've talked
That we cried
There is way too many, then I catch you up in all yo games and yo lies and you wanna get right back with me
I'll admit, I played the fool for a 'lil bit, But this time, it ain't that easy
Mamma told me when you find a man to be with, and he cheat, then the man really don't need me
Wait a minute, let me just think for a second, hold up
Matter fact check it, I was that chick that you could just be real with, now, you just wanna disrespect it
What about all the cars and them clothes?
What about all the stars and them shows?
I don't need nothin', cause you was just frottin'
Its gone, lovin' you want to make, damn


I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do, prove to you
That I'm gone do anything
I only got 4 minutes to say what I gotta say, to make you stay
And show you that I'm gone change
Cause in 4 minutes, I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes, I'm gonna lose her to some other man
Four... no less, no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks tickin'
I got 4 minutes to go


I bet he never realized what he really had until he looked up to the sky and wondered why he had to let it go
Then the picture got crystal clear, the water dirtied, he did, he put his thang on his mental
Should have known when he got invloved, did he think, really think he could play with her heart?
Physic is so sweet, frame is so small
Guys work her art, the girl from next door
But you got me on a race against the clock and I hear it tick tockin' like I'm runnin' outta time
Packin your clothes and tryna head for the door, but I'm not lettin' you go cause you mines and I'm yours
And she's torn, the only thing you can do is pray to God that it ain't too late
Procrastinate and she'll shake the place
You've got about 4 seconds to state your case


I'm outta time (outta time), gotta say what's on my mind (what's on my mind, baby)
Just to keep you in my life
Oh... damn
I'm outta time (it's some real G shit, damn)
