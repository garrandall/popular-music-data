No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn
No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by, don't know the reason why


How could they know just what this message means?
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen?


No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day


But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine where I think of you only
Just two up two down


No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day
As music played, the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance



No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
