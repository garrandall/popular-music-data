You ready to do it
(Yeah, you ready)
Let's walk

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

There's only way to love
That's all the way
There's only way to love
That's all the way

I used to give only half of me
The other girls seemed
To want a piece

But you're the kind
That deserves the best
I know what you need
And I will give no less

There's only way to love
That's all the way
There's only way to love
That's all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I really know just what you need
That's why love comes guaranteed
I know this thought
That gets you hot, girl
I won't stop 'til you get enough

There's only one way to love you
That's all the way
There's only one way to love you
That's all the way, night and day

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Anything in my way
(All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way...)

There's only one way to love you
That's all the way
There's only one way to love you
That's all the way

One way to, one way to
Love you, to love you
One way to, one way to
Love you, to love you

One way to, one way to
Love you, to love you
One way to, one way to

There's only one way to love you
That's all the way
There's only one way to love you
That's all the way

There's only one way to love you
That's all the way
There's only one way to love you
That's all the way, night day

There's only one way to love you
(All the way, all the way)
That's all the way...
