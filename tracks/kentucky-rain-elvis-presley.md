Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long and my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain, whoa
In the cold Kentucky rain

Showed your photograph to some old gray bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said "Yes, she's been here"
But their memory wasn't clear
"Was it yesterday, no, wait, the day before?"

Well, I finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"
And we drove on through the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll be walking through
With the rain in my shoes
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain, whoa
In the cold Kentucky rain, oh
In the cold Kentucky rain
