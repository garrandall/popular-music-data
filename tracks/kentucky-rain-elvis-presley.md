Seven lonely days
And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home


So I'm walking in the rain
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong


Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain


Showed your photograph
To some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said "Yes, she's been here"
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday, no wait, the day before


I finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"
As we drove on thru the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you


Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
The cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
