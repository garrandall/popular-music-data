Anything At All
You've been cheated
You've been messed around
You were looking for heaven
But hell is all that you'vefound
Are you ready for somebody
To put your mind at ease
Cause I'm ready and I'll be there
To fill you every need
Anything at all
I'll give you
Anything at all
To have you here in my arms
Where you belong you gotta believe me
I'd do anything at all
To have you here in my arms
Where you bleong you gotta believe me
I'd do anything at all
Well the first time
I laid my eyes on you
I new my life was changing
And I could'nt lose
I was ready for somebody
To put my mind at ease
So if you want me reach out and touch me
And I do anything for love
