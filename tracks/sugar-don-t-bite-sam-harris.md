The floors are all made out of wood
The price is sure worth the admission
Dreams of the drifters die hard, y'all
Bodies dance through the dark to submission

Fast feet and Saturday night
Leave you nowhere to stand
But nobody here is leaving

Sugar don't bite
Just take me home with you
All through the night
I bet you taste sweeter

Sugar don't bite
I just want to please you
Don't make me beg
Don't make me tease you, no

Sugar don't bite
You know I'm a bleeder
Don't make this boy
Commit a misdemeanor, no

Sugar don't bite
Just sprinkle it on me
Do what you can
Do what you can to me

The beat is agroan and you are
Pounded into my intentions
The heat of the dance it hits hard, y'all
In a trance
We got no inhibitions

Fast feet and Saturday night
Leave you nowhere to stand, no
But nobody here is leaving

Sugar don't bite
Just take me home with you
All through the night
I bet you taste sweeter

Sugar don't bite
I just want to please you
Don't make me beg
Don't make me tease you, no

Sugar don't bite
You know I'm a bleeder
Don't make this boy
Commit a misdemeanor, no

Sugar don't bite
Just sprinkle it on me
Do what you can
Do what you can to me
