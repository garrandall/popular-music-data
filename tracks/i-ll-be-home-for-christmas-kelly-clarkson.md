I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and, and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
