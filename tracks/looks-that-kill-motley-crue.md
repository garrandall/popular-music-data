Listen up
She's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Now she's a cool, cool BLACK
She moves like a cat
If you don't get her name
Well you might not make it back

She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the look 

She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill

Now she's bulletproof
She keeps her motor clean
Oh, and believe me, you
She's a number thirteen
The clock strikes midnight
She's lookin' louder and louder
She's gonna turn on HER juice, boy
Well then she'll turn on her power

She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the look 

She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill

She's got looks that kill
She's got the look


Hey!

Now listen up
She's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Well she's a cool, cool black
Moves like a cat
If you don't get her name
You might not make it back

She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the looks that kill, That kill
She's got the look 

She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
