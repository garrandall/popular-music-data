He raised His hand and said, "They'll need a place to stand"
And created what we now call the land
He raised His hand and said, "They'll need a place to fly"
And created what we now call the sky
And then He gave life life to a man (a man)
And a woman (a woman)
And said, "The rest is in your hands"

So many years have passed since these two people loved
Three billion represents the children of their love
Too many tears have fallen from the eyes of the people
For whom His son had died

Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
To bring their children back together
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
To show us how to love one another (got to learn to love one another)
Show us how to love one another (got to learn to love one another)

When He created all the beauty that we see
I know He had in mind a better life for you and me
But as we grow stronger, more people hunger
Just for the right to be free

Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
To bring their children back together
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
Show us how to love one another (got to learn to love one another)
Show us how to love one another (got to learn to love one another)

Oh! (got to learn to love one another)
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
(Got to learn to love one another)
To bring their children back together
(Got to learn to love one another)
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
(Got to learn to love one another)
To show us how to love one another
(Got to learn to love one another)
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
To bring their children back together (got to learn to love one another)
