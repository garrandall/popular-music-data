Evil ways of practice may surround you
Callin' on your inner core of life
But your father was just a complex man of bus'ness
And your mother merely portioned out your fright
But run the risk of a sudden loss
You got no mama to bear your cross beside you
Uh huh, uh huh
As midnight angels shine their wings
And time begins just bo build a wall around you
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me

Settin' out on a voyage down to Jenner
I've given all I've got to help the cause
Need a place just to settle out my pressures
A place where you and I can sit and pause
So I can see the sky at night
Without a fear of hidden light to blind me
Mm, mm
And so you see the path is clear
And changes will be swayed around me

Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me
