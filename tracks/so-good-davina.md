Tres, un tres tres, un tres
Tres, un tres, tres, un tres
Tres, un tres tres, un tres
Tres, un tres, tres, un tres

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel so good, yeah, ha feels so good
Like this, yeah, feel so good
Hey ya live, bring it

See I been waiting all my whole life
For something like this
Who woulda thought the end of all time
Would start wit a kiss

I'm not the type to show emotion
At the drop of a dime
But at the bottom of the line
The decision is mine

To approach and get close
Takin' a chance in a way
But Xzibit give a damn
What the next man say

Because you only die once
I'm tryin' to live to the limits
And it just now hit me that
I wanna take you wit me

For the long haul, I'll be there
Whenever you call
And get together, we stand
And everything goes according to plan

We'll be tight from tonight
'Till the daylight
If lovin' you is wrong
Then I don't wanna be right so good

Never have I been so mystified
By anyone's love before
(Hey, yeah)
I feel so natural, I keep coming back for more
And each time we touch you open up a new door

Baby, you're such a midnight tease
It's gonna take everything to keep you from me
(Hey, yeah)
And the joy that your lovin' brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea

I don't wanna be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on

I don't wanna be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good

Spent so many nights believing I was wrong
For you being
