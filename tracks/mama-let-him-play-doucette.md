Mama let that boy play some rock and roll
Jazz is much too crazy, he can play it when he's old
He's too young for the blues
He's still inside his first pair of shoes
He's just a baby

Give that boy some freedom, let him move around
Don't get in his way, you'll only bring him down
Mama won't you let him, let him play some rock and roll, yeah
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll, oh yeah
All right
Come on now

Mama let that boy play some rock and roll
Jazz is much too crazy, he can play it when he's old
He's too young for the blues
He's still inside his first pair of shoes
He's so young

Give that boy some freedom, let him move around
Don't get in his way, you'll only bring him down
Mama won't you let him, let him play some rock and roll, yeah
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll, oh yeah
Well, come on now

Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Let him say what he wants to say

Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Let him say what he wants to say

Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll

Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Mama let him play, let him play
Let him say what he wants to say

Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll
Let him play some rock and roll
