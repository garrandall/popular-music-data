Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Don't you know I love you so

Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Don't you know I love you so

I want ya wanna, do ya wanna
And what ya wanna, say you wanna
And why ya wanna go, ya wanna
And how ya wanna, do ya wanna
Ohhh-oh

Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Don't you know I love you so

I want ya wanna, do ya wanna
And what ya wanna, say you wanna
And why ya wanna go, ya wanna
And how ya wanna, do ya wanna
Ohhh-oh

Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Every time we make love, right now
Whip it on me, pretty baby
Don't you know I love you so

(Whip it on me, pretty baby)
(Whip it on me, pretty baby)
(Whip it on me, pretty baby)
(Whip it on me, pretty baby)
