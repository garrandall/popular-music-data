Everybody's talking to computers,
they're all dancing to a drum machine
I know I'm living on the outside 
Scared of getting caught between
I'm so cool calculated alone in a modern world-uh huh

But Sally has a hard time holding back
The alley to her heart is a beaten track
She's got the love monkey riding on her back

You want love I got it, come on girl


We all need the human touch
We all need the human touch
I need it the human touch
We all need the human touch
We all need it, and I need it too

You know, I got my walls, Sally calls them prison cells
Sometimes I need protection, I've got the chains
I got the warning bells
I sit so snug and isolated, alone in the modern world-uh huh

But Sally has a hard time holding back
The alley to her heat is a beaten track
She's never out of love, yeah she's got the knack
You've got love I want it, come on girl



Human touch
Human touch
Human touch
Human touch

I'm so scared and isolated in the modern world

We all need
We all need the human touch
We all need the human touch
We all need the human touch
I need it the human touch
We all need the human touch
I need it the human touch
We all need it and I need it too

Human touch
Human touch
Human touch
Human touch
Human touch
