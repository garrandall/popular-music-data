Just like an astronaut
We don't detox
Yeah
Playing in the mud, all these drugs
Like a weirdo, yeah-yeah
One of a kind, VVS diamond on my earlobe

Hop in that Rari I drive fast I'm asshole
I got cashflow, bitch dropping that s-s low
Ride dick like a lasso
40 on me, it's fuego hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and Pluto astronaut

Alien, I'm not a regular guy
Emilio Pucci, not regular fly
It's been a year since I went in the mall
I'm not a regular guy
We put them beans on a semi you better be ready to die
I got wins on lock, I feel way too high
Left a sticker on the window still gotta pay for tag
Louis Vuitton bandana, too many shopping bags
Richard Mille or the Rollie it don't tick tock
Hermes bandana just like 2Pac
My little brother he a scammer he rap 2 Chop
We want ecstasy and codeine we don't detox

Balenciaga's on my feet these ain't no Reebok's
I grew up a bad kid, 'coulda been Riley on the Boondocks
I keep my hand on my tote
Crib look like a rollout
I roll with them shooters, ain't with the talking we just do it
Stripper bitch, big ol' booty
Your hoe dirty, she got cooties
Big ol' 30, and it do you
I treat that s--t like a movie
White bitch nerdy, her name Susie, uh
The bitch head game go stupid, uh
Birkin bag on my back hold the uzi, uh
Two perc's to the face i'm booling

Blood in my hands, blood in my eyes
Codeine in my cup, money on my mind
Gunna take this Percocet and try and see stars
Presently they ask the young niggas, I got bars
Hope you never get to murder solving like nothing's wrong
Hope one day you runnin to your ops, you get em going
I be with my Chi town brothers, Al Capone
Me and Juice killin these niggas like they got they hands down
Blood in my hands, blood in my eyes
Blood on my bands, made a million dollars in abandon building
Drinking out the bottle you abandon my feelings
Juice WRLD prolly in that Rari actin a asshole
I with some bartenders, they bad like J-Lo
Keep the canon like a tummy tuck pushing yayo
Blow my head off she deserve Chanel coco
I got dirty bands, I'm getting my el chapo

I drive fast I'm an a-hole
I got cashflow, b---h dropping that a-s low
Ride dick like a lasso
40 on me, it's fuego hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and pluto astronaut
I drive fast, hasta luego
I got cashflow, bitch droping that ass low
Ride that s--t like my last hoe
I'm benji hot
Give you a halo
At your neck, ready or not
Me and Juice astronauts
