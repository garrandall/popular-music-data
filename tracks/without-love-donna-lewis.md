Think of me like I think about you 
Give me a sign, show me you care 
Am I so far away in your thoughts not there
forget what you told me, it's what didn't get said 
It's not much to ask, come down off your cloud 
and with your feet on the ground say something out loud

Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love, broken in two 
Without love, give me some value, some worth
Without love, no life left on Earth 

Blame it on work, buy me some flowers
Empty gestures wile away the hours 
Promises, promises sealed with a kiss 
Please acknowledge it's me that you miss 
No message received, excuses believed, you hurt me so much
I'll never recover, takes time to discover a love like no other 

Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love, broken in two 
Without love, give me some value, some worth
Without love, no life left on Earth

Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love
Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love
I mean nothing, I mean nothing, I mean nothing, nothing to you
And I'm broken, and I'm broken, broken in two
I mean nothing
Yeah
