Uh, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I just came out of the dark and we tinted the coupe
Fazo, they called me a hooch
Dive in that water, I'm treadin' through pain, it's true
A general, give me salute
I was a youngin, who'd thought I'd grow into somethin'?
Came out the trenches, it's rugged
I hit the show and the bag that I count is a dozen
Ain't talkin' money, no discussion
I pour the Jean-Paul up in the Fanta, they know how we do it
Everything we do exclusive
Bitches be buggin', a nuisance
I pour the fluid, I need a deuce for the cooler
Cartier cost me a grip
Bought some more jet-skis, oh, what a trip
Ride to Miami, a trunk full of blicks, sticks
Nigga, I came with some misfits

I keep it hot like a heater
He came with Felicia, I ain't even greet her, yeah
Swear the ho just was a sleeper
She turned to an eater, she know how I beat her, yeah
I ride, two doors
Check your paycheck, too low
Bitch, I'm Apex, big bro
He ain't even ate yet, he poor
Yeah, Ciroc, the watermelon
She wanna drank soda, she ain't ready
I was just dozin' at 2 o'clock
Had a gun, heard it jammin' for new spaghetti
In New York with Dominicans, two machetes
I just blow on the zip, lesson in the melly
I ain't fuckin' your bitches, just bring the fetti
Send her home on a mission and get her ready, yeah

I just came out of the dark and we tinted the coupe
Fazo, they called me a hooch
Dive in that water, I'm treadin' through pain, it's true
A general, give me salute
I was a youngin, who'd thought I'd grow into somethin'?
Came out the trenches, it's rugged
I hit the show and the bag that I count is a dozen
Ain't talkin' money, no discussion
I pour the Jean-Paul up in the Fanta, they know how we do it
Everything we do exclusive
Bitches be buggin', a nuisance
I pour the fluid, I need a deuce for the cooler
Cartier cost me a grip
Bought some more jet-skis, oh, what a trip
Ride to Miami, a trunk full of blicks, sticks
Nigga, I came with some misfits

Callin' my nigga, he down the road
Gotta check on him, I know it's mad strong
Put a check on a hop, get her mind gone
Niggas shootin' like they wearin' blindfolds
I get fetti when I got my eyes closed
Know she ready, I hit, then she ride home
Fingers itchin', I just kept the grind on
We gon' burn him, we just cut the nine on

I just came out of the dark and we tinted the coupe
Fazo, they called me a hooch
Dive in that water, I'm treadin' through pain, it's true
A general, give me salute
I was a youngin, who'd thought I'd grow into somethin'?
Came out the trenches, it's rugged
I hit the show and the bag that I count is a dozen
Ain't talkin' money, no discussion
I pour the Jean-Paul up in the Fanta, they know how we do it
Everything we do exclusive
Bitches be buggin', a nuisance
I pour the fluid, I need a deuce for the cooler
Cartier cost me a grip
Bought some more jet-skis, oh, what a trip
Ride to Miami, a trunk full of blicks, sticks
Nigga, I came with some misfits
