Who got the hooch
Who got the hooch
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world


The working day was long
And the road is grinding on
And your body's winding down again
The tribal fire's here
And the circle speaks so near
And the simple truth so very much clearer


Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world


The birds and bees will sing
The jams begin to ring
The good vibes flow from me to you
The evening turns to night
The fire and moonlight
The dance of all who came before


Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world


Let's get real, let's get heavy
Till the water breaks the levee
Let's get loose, loose, who got the hooch
