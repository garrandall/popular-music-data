The night's alive with wind and fire

We telegraph our heart's desire through the night with our eyes.
Wheels are tuniing fast and hard
hearts are burnin' on the Boulevard.
Hear them pound - young and proud:
It's the American heartbeat.
Chart the stars and head out for the action

Hit the streets and find some satisfaction.
It's the American heartbeat
it's the American heartbeat

Oh
the American heartbeat.
The stage is set
the roles are chosen.
The lights grow hot as the midnight's closin' in at last -
It comes so fast.
Poundin' harder as the midnight's strikin'

It hits us like a bolt of lightning.
Deeper down
it's the sound of the American heartbeat.
Chart the stars and head out for the action

Hit the streets an find some satisfaction.
It's the American heartbeat - young and proud

The American heartbeat - young and proud

American heartbeat
the American heartbeat

It's the American heartbeat
it's the American heartbeat
. . .
