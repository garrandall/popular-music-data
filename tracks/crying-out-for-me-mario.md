1, 2, 3, 4
Yeah (uh huh)
Polo the Don
Listen girl Mario Let’s go
Ladies


It’s like you caught up in a maze
You keep on going in circles girl you’re trying to find your way out
But its time I put on my cape and
Put that s on my chest
Girl I wanna come and save you


But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I've known you first
It’s getting louder, girl
Can’t ignore it no more
I can't


I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me
(I can baby) I can hear your heart crying out for me


Baby, I should’ve never caught no feelings
But baby having late night conversion on your sofa
You telling me how he played you out over and over
Over and over


But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I knew you first
It’s getting louder
Girl I can’t ignore it no more ,baby


I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
I can hear your heart (oh yeah) crying out for me
(And girl it’s saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (oh oh oh)
I can hear your heart (I can hear it yeah) crying out for me
Girl it’s crying it’s crying


I don’t wanna confuse things (no)
But I just can’t keep lying to myself
When you’re holding me (when you’re holding me)
I can feel your pain oh baby let me be your dream
I’m the answer come see me (see me)
And u don’t have to cry no more (u don’t have to cry)
Girl I can hear your heart baby
I can hear your heart
Girl it’s crying
Won’t you listen to your heart, baby


I can hear your heart crying out for me (girl it’s crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it’s saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
I can hear your heart crying out for me


Girl I can hear, hear it crying for me, for me, for me, for me
Ladies wave your hands in the air
Ladies wave your hands in the air
Oh baby
It’s crying for me
It’s crying for me for me
