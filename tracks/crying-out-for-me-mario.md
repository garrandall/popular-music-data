Awwwaa MARIO!! and young weezy baby, so ya know that only means one thang, its the remix baby


So i met this shawty the otha day
I got her number called her up like what you doin she said nothin 
I said whats good 
She said not much 
I said guess what? 
She said whats up 
I said i think we should hook up 
She said uhh 
I said what? 
She said but
I said but? why you stuck? 
She said f**k 
I said who?
She said not you
I said then who?
She said you know 
I know what?
You know who 
I said i do?
She said you do
I said i do but i really dont because its you that i really want and we can do what you really
Want girl we grown if he aint gone treat you right then i aint gone treat you wrong
And thats my word but she done heard so many lies she dont whats true or not, shawty like a
Valle service i swear she been through alot but i put her car in park and never let her cry alone
I listen to her heart beat because it plays my favorite song


I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me
(I can baby) I can hear your heart crying out for me


Baby, I should've never caught no feelings
But baby having late night conversion on your sofa
You telling me how he played you out over and over, over and over
But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I knew you first
It's getting louder
Girl I can't ignore it no more baby


I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
I can hear your heart (oh yeah) crying out for me
(And girl it's saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (oh oh oh)
I can hear your heart (I can hear it yeah) crying out for me
Girl it's crying it's crying


I don't wanna confuse things (no)
But I just can't keep lying to myself
When you're holding me (when you're holding me)
I can feel your pain oh baby let me be your dream
I'm the answer come see me (see me)
And u don't have to cry no more (u don't have to cry)

Girl I can hear your heart baby
I can hear your heart
Girl it's crying
Won't you listen to your heart, baby


I can hear your heart crying out for me (girl it's crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it's saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
I can hear your heart crying out for me

Girl I can hear, hear it cry for me, for me, for me, for me

Ladies wave your hands in the air
Ladies wave your hands in the air

Oh baby
It's crying for me
It's crying for me for me
