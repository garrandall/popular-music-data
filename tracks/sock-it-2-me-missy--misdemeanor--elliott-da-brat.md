Hehe, nigga
I'm nasty
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
No, no, no


I was looking for affection, so I decided to go
Swing that dick in my direction, I'll be out of control
Let's take it to perfection, just you and me
Let's see if you can bring, bring, bring the nasty out of me
N-n-n-now sock it


Ooh ah, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (oh)
I can take it like a pro, you know (know)
Do it long bro with the back stroke (hey)
My hormones jumping like a disco (hey)
I be popping mess like some Crisco
All you gotta say is Missy go
And when you say go I won't move slow (slow)


I'm at your house around midnight (midnight), don't fall asleep
It'll just be me, me, me on a late night creep
I'ma show you thangs that you can't believe
Jump in this b-e-d, and won't you sock it to me?
Oh no, s-sock it to me


Ooh ah, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (sock it to me)
I can take it like a pro, you know
Do it long bro with a back stroke (hey)
My hormones jumping like a disco (hey)
I be popping mess like some Crisco (heeeey)
And all you gotta say is Missy go (ohhh)
And when you say go I won't move slow (slow)

Ooh ah, sock it to me like you want to, ooh
I can take it like a pro, you know
Do it long bro with the back stroke
My hormones jumping like a disco
I be popping ish like some Crisco
And all you gotta say is Missy go
And when you say go I won't move slow (uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sock it to me

Ooh ah, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (ooh)
I can take it like a pro, you know (you know)
Do it long bro with the back stroke
My hormones jumping like a disco (hey)
I be popping mess like some Crisco (hey)
And all you gotta say is Missy go (heeeey)
And when you say go I won't move slow


Uh
Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit combination is lethal
Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?


I'm your nigga for life, baby (haha)
Let's continue to drive all this motherfuckers crazy
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, Timbaland, I see you, baby
I feel you, sock it to 'em, goddammit
It's 9-7, this the motherfuckin' bitch era
What y'all niggas wanna do?
The Brat-tat-tat on that ass once more
I'm out the door motherfucker, yeah, uh
