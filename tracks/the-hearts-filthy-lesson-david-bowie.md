(Heart's filthy lesson)
There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies
Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon dead ears

(Heart's filthy lesson)
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy?
Paddy oh Paddy,
I think I've lost my way
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
I'm already, I'm already, I'm already
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson

Tell the others
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy,
What a fantastic death abyss
Tell the others
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy,
what a fantasic death abyss
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others
