If you need me, I wantcha to call me
Said if you need me, all ya gotta do is call me
Don't wait too long if things go wrong
I'll be home, who a-oh-oh, home

If you want me, send for me
I said if you want me, want, all ya gotta do is send for me
Don't wait too long, just a pick up your phone
And I'll (hurry home where I belong)

People always said, darlin', that I didn't mean you no good
And you would need me someday
Way deep down in my heart
I know I've done the best I could
That's why I know that one of these days, it won't be long
You'll come walkin' through that same door (I'll hurry home)
And I can imagine in my mind that these are the words that
You'll be sayin'

I still love you, always thinkin' of you
And I still love, love, always thinkin' of you
Don't wait too long, just a pick up your phone
And I'll hurry home (I'll hurry home)
Right there, where I belong
