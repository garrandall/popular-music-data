Purple haze
Running through my brain
Somehow, people, lately
Things don't seem the same

I'm acting funny
And found the reason why
Excuse me while
I kiss the sky

Purple haze
Now it's coming all around
Don't know whether of if
I'm coming up or down

Somebody, am I happy
Or am I in misery
Whatever it is
She put a spell on me

Put a spell on me
Purple haze
