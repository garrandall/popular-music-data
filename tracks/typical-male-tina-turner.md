TELL ME LAWYER WHAT TO DO
I THINK I`M FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU
DEFEND ME, FROM THE WAY I FEEL
WON`T YOU GIVE ME SOME ADVICE
ON HOW TO HANDLE MY PRIVATE LIFE
I`M SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE A DEAL

I CONFESS I`M A FOOL FOR A MAN
WITH A CLEVER MIND
BUT YOUR INTELLECT AIN`T NO MATCH
FOR THIS HEART OF MINE


ALL I WANT IS A LITTLE REACTION
JUST ENOUGH TO TIP THE SCALES
I`M JUST USING MY FEMALE ATTRACTION
ON A TYPICAL MALE, ON A TYPICAL MALE

YOUR SENSE OF JUSTICE I`LL EMBRACE
BUT YOUR DEFENCE DON'T HELP MY CASE
I`M DEEP IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW
SOMETHING ABOUT AUTHORITY
SEEMS TO BRING OUT THE BAD IN ME
HEY LAWYER, GOTTA CATCH ME WHEN I FALL

OH THEY SAY THAT YOU MATCH YOUR WITS
WITH THE BEST OF THEM
BUT I KNOW WHEN I`M CLOSE YOU`RE JUST
LIKE THE REST OF THEM



SO PUT YOUR BOOKS ASIDE
LOOSEN OFF THE SUIT AND TIE
OPEN OFF YOUR HEART AND LET ME IN
OPEN OFF YOUR HEART AND LET ME IN
