I want you to remember
A love so full it could send us all ways
And I want you to surrender 
All my feelings rose today

And I want you to remain
The power of children can amaze
I'll try not to complain
I know that's a pisser baby

The chemicals between us 
The walls that lie between us
Lying this bed 
The chemicals displaced 
There is no lonelier state 
Lying this bed 

I want you to remember
Everything you said
Every driven word 
Like a hammer, held, to my head

The chemicals between us 
The walls that lie between us
Lying this bed
The chemicals displaced 
There is no lonelier face 
Lying this bed

The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us
Lying this bed 

We're of the hollow men
We are the naked ones 
We never meant you harm
Never meant you wrong

And I'd like to thank 
All of my lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers

The chemicals between us
The army of achievers
Lying this bed 
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier face 
Lying this bed

The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us 
Chemicals 

The chemicals between us
