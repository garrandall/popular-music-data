I don't want to spend another lonely night
ooooooo

I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked, the bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone


Prayin' for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave
'Cause if you're getting on with your new life
Then where does that leave me



Prayin for daylight

Prayin for daylight
Hoping that I didn't wait too long
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart I know 
That you love me as much as i love you
And that you must be lying somehwere
Looking up to heaven too



Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
