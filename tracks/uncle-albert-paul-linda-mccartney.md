We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home, and I believe I'm gonna rain


We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring


We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil and we're so easily called away




Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky


Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look, and I had a cup of tea and a butter pie (Butter pie?)
(The butter wouldn't melt so I put it in the pie, alright?)


Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky


Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around


Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
