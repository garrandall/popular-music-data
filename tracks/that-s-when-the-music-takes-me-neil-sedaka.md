That's when the music takes me
Takes to a brighter day
That's when the music takes me
Helpin' me to find my way

When the day is so long that I can't hold on
When I'm down and I think my hope is gone
Oh, Yeah,
That's when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter daaaay
I can feel my soul explodin'
There's a good feelin'
Helpin' me to find my waaay
My, my, my way

When the bluebird sings her sad, sad song
And the wind brings a cold to tag along
Oh, yeah,
I can feel the spirit move me
I can almost touch the sky
Reachin' for a new tomorrow
I know it's hard
But music makes me waaaaanna try
Wanna try
And then
That's when the music takes me
Takes to a brighter day
Yeah, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Helpin' me to find my way
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me)
Oh, yeah
But when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter day
I can feel my soul explodin'
There's a good feelin'
Helpin' me to find my waaay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And then I'm sayin'
That's when the music takes me
Takes to a brighter day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Helpin' me to find my way

Happy, happy, happy day
Happy, happy, happy day
Happy, happy, happy day
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me)
(And that's when the music takes me)
Happy, happy when the music takes
Whooooooo
