She may not be the best lookin' woman
I ever did see
Nor have the charms of the ladies
Of high society

But the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul

Now I'm just a regular fellow
I don't need much
I don't need a Cadillac car
Or diamonds and such

But the woman that I hold
She's got to have soul
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul

Well, I don't need a woman
That's got a whole lotta class
Because class in a woman
Don't mean she's gonna last
I need the kind of woman
That when I hold she fits so tight, yeah
Oh, and when she throws it on me
I give in without a fight

Then I know... the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul
If the woman's got soul
If the woman's got soul
If the woman's got soul
If the woman's got soul
