He's got a house made of glass
Got his own swimming pool
(What a gas)
We've got a one room shack
Five by six by the railroad track

(Well)
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us

He's with a beautiful chick
Every night of the week
(Pretty slick)
We're two poor hung up souls
Girls won't touch with ten foot poles

(Well)
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us

He goes to eat at the Ritz
Big steaks
(That's the breaks)
We eat our hominy grits
From a bag
(What a drag)

He's got a car made of suede
With a black leather top
(Got it made)
If we go out on dates
We go in a box on our roller skates

(Well)
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us

He goes to eat at the Ritz
Big steaks
(That's the breaks)
We eat our hominy grits
From a bag
(What a drag)

He's got a car made of suede
With a black leather top
(Got it made)
If we go out on dates
We go in a box on our roller skates

(Well)
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us
What about us, what about us
