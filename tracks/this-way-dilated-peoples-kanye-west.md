Now turn it up, (a little louder) turn it up (a little louder)
Turn it up, (a little louder) turn it up (little louder)
Now turn it up (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live)
Now turn it up, turn it up


I, I can't live my, can't live my
Yeah, yo I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continually really get high
Instead of runnin 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get right
Show no respect can't live that way
You hold my check can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way
Our moves calculated through the limbs, almost here
Succes will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West (whut up, whut up!)
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets (everyday!)


This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way


Kanye to the
My favorite girl wanna leave just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me "now, she a christian"
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin girls off the bench like a "sixth-man"
I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step
While Omega's doing the same ol' "Q step"
I have my money on my mind I was thinkin green
She a pledge A.K.A. "she was pink and green"
I wanna a good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmagin'
My pimpinship's so hard it needs censorship
I'ma chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know when I'm gettin one, the other's gettin away
This way




Go 'head, flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama keep name apart
I learnt before the hot flame came the spark
It's like 'fore the pop fame came the park
But this industry'll play with yo' life man
They playin with yo' rent, food, water and lights man (yeah)
That's why Rakaa brings that old tidy T jam
The veteran, then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strenght to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run-DMC showed me how to walk, this way
