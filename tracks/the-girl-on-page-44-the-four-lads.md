I'd like to get a girl
From Sears and Roebuck
Like the one that I saw
Wearing short shorts on page 44

I sent for lots of things
From Sears and Roebuck
Spark plugs and fancy ties
Now I'd like to send for the
Gal with baby blue eyes

So tell me, what's the order number
For the cutest number in your catalog
Gee, I need her, oh, so badly
I'll spend a million kisses gladly

I'm lonely
Mr. Sears and Mr. Roebuck
Come on and send her to me
And make it Air Mail Special KOD

Wearing short shorts on page 44

Now I'd like to send for the
Gal with baby blue eyes

So tell me, what's the order number
For the cutest number in your catalog
Gee, I need her, oh, so badly
I'll spend a million kisses gladly

I'm lonely
Mr. Sears and Mr. Roebuck
Come on and send her to me
And make it Air Mail Special KOD

Kisses On Delivery
Air Mail Special KOD
