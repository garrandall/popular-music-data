It's all behind me
There's good luck up ahead
Can't break what's left of my heart
Once bitten twice shy
I hate to see it all fall apart
First love I had I was seventeen and I was younger
Love to us was some kind of game
And all my letters said I would never forget her
Now I can't recall her name
The first time I was a fool
never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky
Oh Yeah
I was in love one time
I thought it was the real thing
But I kept the feelings to myself
Afraid to show them
Expecting her to know
It's the reason she found someone else
It's all behind me
There's good luck up ahead
Can't break what's left of my heart
Once bitten twice shy
I hate to see it all fall apart
The first time I was a fool
never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky
Oh Yeah
The first time I was a fool
never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky
Oh Yeah
The first time I was a fool
never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky
Oh Yeah
