I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winemaca road
When along came a semi with high and canvas covered load
If you're going to Winemaca Mack with me you can ride
So I climed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I seen a road with so much dust and sand
Then I said listen bud I've traveled every road in this here land

I've been everywhere man I've ben everywhere man
Cross the deserts bare man I've breathed the mountain air man
Of travel I've had my share man I've been everywhere

I've been to Reno Chicago Fargo Minnesota Buffalo Toronto Winslow Sarasota
Wichita Tulsa Ottawa Oklahoma Tampa Panama Mattawa La Paloma
Bangor Baltimore Salvador Amarillo Tocopilla Barranquilla and Padilla I'm a killer
I've been everywhere man...

Boston Charleston Dayton Louisiana Washington Houston Kingston Texarkana
Monterey Ferriday Santa Fe Tallapoosa Glen Rock Black Rock Oskaloosa
Tennessee Hennessey Chicopee Spirit Lake
Grand Lake Devil's Lake Crater Lake for Pete's sake
I've been everywhere man...

Louisville Nashville Knoxville Ombabika Shefferville Jacksonville Waterville Costa Rica
Pittsfiels Springfield Bakersfield Shreveport Hackensack Cadillac Fond Du Lac Davenport
Idaho Jellicoe Argentina diamontina Pasadena Catalina see what I mean-a
I've been everywhere man...

Pittsburgh Parkersburg Gravellburg Colorado Ellensburg Rexburg Vicksburg Eldorado
Larrimore Atmore Haverstraw Chattanika Chaska Nebraska Alaska Opelika
Baraboo Waterloo Kalamazoo Kansas City Cedar City Dodge City what a pity
I've been everywhere man...
(I know some place you haven't been) I've been everywhere
