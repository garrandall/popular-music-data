I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so
I only know
I never want to let you go


Cause you started something
Can`t you see?
That ever since we've met
You`ve had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you


It doesn't matter
Where you go or what you do
I`d love to spend each moment
Of the day with you

Look what has happened
Just one kiss
I never knew that
I could be in love like this
It`s crazy
But it`s true
I only wanna be with you

You stopped
Yu smiled at me
And asked if I`d care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn`t stand a chance

Now listen, honey
I just wanna be
Beside you everywhere
As long as we`re together
Honey, I don`t care

You stopped
You smiled at me
And asked if I`d care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn`t stand a chance

Now listen, honey
I just wanna be
Beside you everywhere
As long as we`re together
Honey, I don`t care



No matter what you do
I only, I only
I only wanna be with you
