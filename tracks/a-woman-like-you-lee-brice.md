Last night, outta the blue
Driftinâ off to the evening news
She said, "Honey, what would you do
If youâd have never met me"
I just laughed, said "I donât know,
But I could take a couple guesses though"
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, "Darling honestly...

Iâd do a lot more offshore fishinâ
Iâd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If Iâd have never known your name
Iâd still be driving that old green âNova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
I'd be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well Iâd be looking for a woman like you."

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, "Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,
I wouldnât trade a single day
For 100 years the other way."
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
Cause sheâs heard all of my lines
I said, "Câmon on girl, seriously
If I hadnât been so lucky, Iâd be..

Shootinâ pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night, yeah
Iâd have a dirt bike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
Iâd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well Iâd be looking for a woman like you."

She knows what a mess Iâd be if I didnât have her here
But to be sure, I whispered in her ear
"You know I get sick deep-sea fishinâ
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green âNova
But I love watchinâ you do yoga
Iâd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly I donât know what Iâd do
If Iâd never met a woman like you."
