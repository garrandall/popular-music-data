It's not my way, to talk to strangers
But I feel like I already know you, oh
And if you need somebody
I wanna manage you, huh
I can tell that you've been through some changes in your past, relationships
But come on and walk through that door
Cause I'm what you've been waitin for
Whatever's on your mind (let it all)
Girl we've got lots of time (we can talk)
Through all the good times and bad times


I wanna be the gots ta be in your life
Gots ta be the one that makes you sad
Gots ta be the one you never had
Gots ta be the one that you want so damn bad
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything (everything)
Gots be the only one you fight
Gots ta be the one that makes it right
Gots ta be the one you don't like half the time (the time)
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything


Girl you just can't love anybody
I take it I'm the right one for you, oh
But you gots to believe me
Cause everything that I tell you is true, yeah
I wanna be your mother, your father, your brother, and your sister too
Be the good,be the bad
Be the gots ta love that you run to
Girl
whatevers on your mind (let it on)
Girl we've got lots of time (we can talk)
Through all the good times, and bad times


I wanna be the gots to be in your life
Gots ta be the one that gets  your nerves
Gots ta be the one you don't deserve
Gots ta be the only one that you serve
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything
Gots ta be the one to change your fate
Gots ta be the one you love to hate
Gots ta be the one you let eat off your plate
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything


Listen
Things aren't always gonna be, be so easy girl
And I can let you know for sure that I gonna always be right here
(right here for the long run)
I might make you mad, you cuss me out, but your still my girl
And I promise that I'll never put my hands on you girl
I wanna be everything to you girl


Gots ta be the one you that you can't stand
Gots ta be the one you call your man
Gots ta be the one to put a ring on that hand
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything
Gots ta be the one you can't forget
Gots ta be the one that you regret
Gots ta be the one like you ain't never met
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be your everything


Listen
I don't want you love nobody but me
You and me can do almost anything
Gots ta be the one you want
Gots ta be the one you flaunt
You can't get mad at nobody but me
In fact I'm the only one you can recieve
Gots ta be the one you want
Gots ta be the one you flaunt
