Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Quite honest with ya
I ain't really sleep well
You ever feel like your train of thoughts been derailed?
That's when you press on Lee Nails

Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retail

But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I'll be in your corner like Mick, baby, 'til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gon' do y'all?


Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life 'til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town

Text book version of a kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling, "Kiss my ass"
It's gonna take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs
For you to recognize you really ain't got it bad

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gon' do y'all?


Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life 'til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

Everybody put yo fists up

What we gon' do
What we gon' do
What we gon' do
tell me what we gon' do y'all?

What we gon' do
What we gon' do
What we gon' do y'all?

I know what we gon' do

If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up)
And when your bones can't take no more (c'mon)
Just remember what you're here for
'Cause I know I'mma damn sure

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life 'til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

'Til the referee rings the bell
'Til both your eyes start to swell
'Til the crowd goes home
What we gon' do kid?
