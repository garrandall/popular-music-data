Just give me a steel guitar, a glass of wine 
And let me drink to a love I thought was mine 
A love I thought was true to me 
But now I'm drinkin' to her memory 
A steel guitar and a glass of wine 
While my tears they glisten and the candles shine 
Oh candle-glow, oh candle bright 
Tell me who she holds tonight 

And bring me wine 
And make the music mine 
Play another set 
So that I'll forget 

Mmm, bring me a steel guitar and a glass of wine 
And let me toast her just one more time 
Oh candle-glow, before you dim 
Tell her what a fool she's been 

And bring me wine 
Make the music mine 
Play another set 
So that I'll forget 

And bring me a steel guitar and a glass of wine 
And let me toast her just one more time 
Oh candle-glow, before you dim 
Tell her what a fool she's been 

And one more thing before I go 
Here's a secret, I still love her so 
And one more thing before I go 
Here's a secret, I still love her so 
And one more thing before I go 
Here's a secret, I still love her so 
And one more thing before I go 
Here's a secret, I still love her so
