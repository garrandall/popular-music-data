Waiting for the peace of the night to be shattered
I do believe my illusions are in tatters
When I see the pale moonlight in the sky
I know its gonna come, like a hurricane hittin
I breathe a sight coz its only the beginning
When I see reflection deep in his eyes, I know, he's got the power to hit it!


I don't believe what he said to me,
I'm feeling like a piece of machinery
Gotta get in closer coz I can't see
When you're telling me the truth, I refuse to believe

Running on the ground with my innocence fading
I do believe there is something I am gaining
When I get that red hot fever inside
I wanna give it hell, and behave just like a gonner
I wanna stay and reduce the things I wanna
When I see the pale moonlight in the sky, I know
Hes got the power to hit it!
