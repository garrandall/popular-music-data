Girl you know that this is wrong
Got to go one way or the other
I can't keep turning my love off and on
If we really love each other
I've said enough for both of us
And I'm starving for your touch
Baby bring it on back
Bring your sweet love back to me girl
Baby bring it on back
I'm so lonely, can't you see
When the falling leaves are filled with rain
Oh, you heart it calls to me
Say when will I see you again
And the wind will answer me
I need your arms to comfort me
Oh I want to hold you tenderly
Baby bring it on back
Bring your sweet love back to me girl
Baby bring it on back
I'm so lonely, can't you see
It's not right to leave it up to fate
If we don't try to work it out
It might be too late
Bring the love and caring back
Bring it all back to me
Because all I feel now is the lack
Babe, bring it all back
Such a sad song, sad song to me
Cause with you baby
Such a sad song, sad song to me
Baby bring it on back
I want your love, yes I do girl
Baby bring it on back
Lone-lon-lon
Baby bring it on back
Baby bring it on back
Baby I say baby
Baby bring it on back
I know, back to me
