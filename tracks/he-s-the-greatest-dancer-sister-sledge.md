Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so borin', filled without-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing

I really wasn't carin' but I felt my eyes starin'
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit as a man he is complete
My crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, please take me home

He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Oh from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I've ever seen)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I love your moves)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I've ever seen)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I love your moves)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
