Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play

Oh the games people play now every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say, yeah never saying what they mean
First you whine away your hours in your concrete towers
Soon you'll be covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine

People walking up to you singing glory Hallelujah
Then thy try to sock it to you, oh in the name of the Lord

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play

Oh the games people play now every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say, yeah never saying what they mean
And they teach you how to meditate read up your horoscope
And change your faith and further more to hell with hate
Come on and give me some more, and more, and more

Na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
Na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na, na na na, na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play

First you're giving up your sanity turn your back on humanity, yeah
And you don't give a damn, a damn, a damn

Na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na, na na na, na na
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
Talkin' 'bout you and me, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play

Talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
Oh, talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah and the games people play
