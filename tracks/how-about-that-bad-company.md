Last night, when the moon was new, I couldn't sleep, I was thinkin' of you
And how much I need ya, how about that

I act like I'm tougher than steel
With a heart like a stone, but you know it ain't real
I need you baby, how about that, hey

Oooh, how about that

I used to spend my life on the town, it took your lovin' to turn me around
I'm crazy about you, how about that

People used to tell ya I'm a crazy fool
But you taught me more than I could learn in school, I say
I really need ya, baby, how about that

If ever you need time and space
Don't run away, just tell me face to face, yeah

Oooh, how about that, how 'bout that, oooh, how about that, baby
Oooh, how about that, yeah alright, oh baby

When I think back of how it used to be, before we met it's just a mystery
I can't live without you, no, how about that

And you got my heart and you got my soul
Ooh you got my whole life under control
Looks like we made it, yeah, how about that, ooh yeah

And everytime I see your face, it lightens up the whole damn place
Yeah, I wanna see this whole thing through
Yeah, there's nothing I won't do for you, oh yeah

Oooh, how about that, how 'bout it, baby
Oooh, how about that, yeah, t-tell me
Oooh, how about that, how 'bout it, baby, oooh, yeah

Last night, when the moon was new
I couldn't sleep, I was there, lookin' at you
Yeah I'm glad that I found you, how about that, hey

Everytime I see your face, it lightens up the whole damn place
Yeah, I wanna see this whole thing through
Yeah, I wanna spend my life with you, oh yeah

Oooh, how about that, hey, how 'bout it baby
Oooh, how about that, t-tell me
Oooh, how about that, tell me baby
Oooh, how about that, baby yeah
Oooh, hey how about that, how about that, how about it baby
Oooh, yeah how about that, oh, oh...
