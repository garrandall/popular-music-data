I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart


So, we fight, so, we fight through the hurt, through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, and we live, and we learn, and we learn
And we try and try and try and try


So, it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth,
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth

Mamma, you were always somewhere
And, daddy, I live out of town,
So, tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So, tell me why am I in tears?
Whoa, so far away. And now I just need you here

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again



Fell so far away
From where we used to be
And now we're standing
And where do we go when there's no road
To get to your heart?
So, let's start over again



I never thought it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
