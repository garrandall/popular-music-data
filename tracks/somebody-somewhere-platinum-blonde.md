She lives inside a glass house across the lane
The walls are full of photographs she saved
All the children wave on their way to school
They've seen every film she ever made

Something inside her is burning out
Something just wants to shout

Somebody somewhere will change your mind
Somebody somewhere

Her boyfriend's got a flat inside the country house
At night he posts some pictures of the Mayor
He never calls to find out if she's all alone
He never stops to wonder if she's there

Chorus

On the shelf lies a dusty old pocketbook
Inside are all the friends she used to know

Something inside her is burning out
Something just wants to shout

Chorus

Somewhere, somewhere
