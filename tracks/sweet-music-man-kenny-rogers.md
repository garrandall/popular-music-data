I wouldn't listen, and I couldn't see
And all I have left now
Are words you said to me

Sing me a song sweet music man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand
Like I used to
I'm through with you
You're a helluva singer
And a powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singing along right with you
You said "I need you"
Then you changed the words and that harmony
And you sang that song you'd written for me
To someone new

But nobody sings a love song quite like you do
And nobody else can make me sing along
And nobody else can make me feel
That things are right when you know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing me a song sweet music man
Your making a living doing one night stands
That do for you what you need them to
Your still a hell of a singer but a broken man
And you surround yourself with people who demand
So little of you

But nobody sings a love song quite like you do
You travel the world with a six piece band
That does for you what you ask 'em to
And you try to stay up with the songs you sung
To so many people that all begun to come
Back on you

Sing me a song sad music man
You're making your living doing one night
Stands that's do with you they
Don't need you, you're still a helluva singer
But a broken man but you keep on looking for
One last band to sing with you

But nobody sings a love song quite like you do
And nobody else can make me sing along
And nobody else can make me feel
That things are right when you're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

So sing me a song sweet music man
I believe in you
