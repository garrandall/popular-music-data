She said sing a song sweet music man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand like I used to
I'm through with you
You're a hell of a singer and powerful man
But you surround yourself with people who
Demand so little of you.

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
Even had me singin' along right with you you said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
Sang the song you had written for me to someone new.

Nobody sings love songs quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel the things are right
When I know they're wrong
Nobody sings love songs quite like you.

Sing your song sweet music man
Travel the world with a six piece band that does for you
What you ask me to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you.

Sing your song sad music man
Makin' your living doing one night stands
They're through with you they don't need you
You're still a hell of a singer but a broken man.

But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel the things are right
When they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.

She said, sing your song sweet music man I believe in you...
