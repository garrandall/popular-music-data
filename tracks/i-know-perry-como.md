( I Know, I know, oh yes, I know! )

I know what it means
To be lost in the dark!
I know what it means
To be tossed by the storm!

I have walked alone
With a heart of stone
And despair too heavy for tears
But you caught my heart
And you taught my heart
To forget it's doubts and fear!

And now that I know
The joy of your love
My head is high, I can face the sky
And know that heaven is here below
I know . . 

For you I could die
For you I will live
I know!

( I Know, I know, I know! )
