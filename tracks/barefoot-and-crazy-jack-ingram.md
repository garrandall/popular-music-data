The clouds are partin', the summer suns startin'
To burn down on that river
My baby's waitin', I got the Chevy shakin'
I'm blazin' a trail to get her, there she is

She's got her shades on and man, she's lookin' strong
Mine all mine for the weekend
The coolers loaded down, we're headed outta town
Jumpin' off the deep end

Goin' barefoot and crazy, me and my baby
Back flip off the flip right bridge
Double dog, dare me and I will
Meet me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss

She's rockin' that bikini top
My hearts skippin' like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin' barefoot and crazy

The sun is droppin', we got the fire poppin'
And it's lightin' up her blue eyes
With a little bit of luck it'll heat things up
And we'll be lovin' in the moonlight

Break out my old guitar, sing fishin' in the dark
Baby, get ready
We'll take a little sip, we'll take a little dip
And sleep in the bed of my Chevy

Goin' barefoot and crazy, me and my baby
Just me and her and the man in the moon
Drinkin' on a cold bud brew
Mornin's gonna come way too soon

We'll wake up and do it all again
Wishin' it would never end
Anybody asks where we've been
Tell 'em barefoot and crazy

Barefoot and crazy, me and my baby
I did a back flip off the flip right bridge
Double dog dared me and I did
Met me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss

She's rockin' that bikini top
My hearts skippin' like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop

Goin' barefoot and crazy
Don't ever wanna stop, don't ever wanna stop
Goin' barefoot and crazy

Goin' barefoot and crazy
Don't ever wanna stop, don't ever wanna stop
Goin' barefoot and crazy, goin' barefoot and crazy
