Ann, Ann-Marie, Ann-Marie, Ann-Marie

There was a time when I was fancy-free, yeah
And all the girls would
Make a play for me

Oh, oh, I used to be a runaround
Then a girl came and put me down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Ann Marie

The way she leads me round
Is a disgrace, yeah
When I walk down the street
I hide my face

Oh, oh, I used to be a ladies man
But now she's got me
In the palm of her hand
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Ann Marie

Inside, I'm torn apart
Why did I have to start
To fool around with that Ann Marie
I love her but she don't love me

Someday, Anne Marie
You're gonna see, yeah
The day will come when
You're in love with me

Oh, oh, oh, and when the tables turn
For my love, you're gonna yearn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Ann Marie

Oh, oh, oh, and when the tables turn
For my love, you're gonna yearn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Ann Marie

I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ann Marie, Ann Marie, Ann Marie
