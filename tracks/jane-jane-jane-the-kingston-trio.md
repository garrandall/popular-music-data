Jane, Jane, Jane, mark my bonnie Jane as sweet as sugar in the cane, don't be ashame
Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be, but the prettiest girl in all the world to me

Jane, Jane, Jane, with the pretty, pretty face, dressed in rags she still looks like a queen
Jane, Jane, Jane, she should be in silk and lace, the prettiest girl that you have ever seen

Jane, Jane, Jane, mark my bonnie Jane as sweet as sugar in the cane, don't be ashame
Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be, but the prettiest girl in all the world to me

Jane, Jane, Jane, she has no mom or dad. She's all alone but still she is not sad
The wild birds sing a song, her little dog tags along. To hear her laughter makes my poor heart glad

Jane, Jane, Jane, mark my bonnie Jane as sweet as sugar in the cane, don't be ashame
Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be, but the prettiest girl in all the world to me

I know Jane is sweet by the sounding of her feet. I see her beauty when she speaks to me
If she could see me now, my love to her I'd vow but I couldn't love her more if I could see

Jane, Jane, Jane, mark my bonnie Jane as sweet as sugar in the cane, don't be ashame
Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be, but the prettiest girl in all the world to me

But I couldn't love her more if I could see
But I couldn't love her more if I could see
