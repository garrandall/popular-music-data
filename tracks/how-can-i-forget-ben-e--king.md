I want to know, know, know, know, know
(How can I forget)
I've got to know, know, know, know, know
(How can I forget)
How could I forget
(Forget her)

When I was lonely, she chased away
The little girl chased away all of my blues
When I was down and out
She went somewhere and bought me
She brought me a brand new pair of shoes

So tell me, tell me, tell me
(How can I forget)
How, how, how, how
(How can I forget)
How could I forget
(Forget her)

Yesterday she left for somebody new
My friends all say forget her
Go out and do the same they do

But how when her kisses still lingers on my lips
And my cheeks, ask for her finger tips
Since she's been gone, I can't sleep at night
And since she's been gone, I can't eat or bite

Oh, so tell me, tell me, tell me
(How can I forget)
How, how, how, how, how
(How can I forget)

How can I forget
(How can I forget)
I wanna know how can I forget
(How can I forget)

And I've got to know, I've for got know
How can I forget
(How can I forget)
I've got to know somebody help me forget my baby, baby, baby
(How can I forget)

How can I forget, forget, forget
(How can I forget)
