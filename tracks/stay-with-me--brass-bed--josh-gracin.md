Baby, the clock on the wall is lying
It's not really that late
It's too cold outside to be walking around
the streets of this town
Anywhere if you think you have to be can wait


So why don't you stay with me?
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun  never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me, yeah

Baby, there's just no use in hiding
The way that I am feeling right now
With you standing there baby I swear I can't help but stare
Girl you're wearing me out, wearing me out


Baby why don't you stay with me?
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe
the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
We'll be alright as long as you stay with me


Baby don't go it looks like it's starting to rain
And it's so warm here in this apartment wrapped up in this blanket

So Stay



I'll be all right as long as you
Stay with me
