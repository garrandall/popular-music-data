Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
I wanna love you so bad I don't know what to do

Going down to louisiana to get me a mojo hand
Going down to louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women right here at my command

Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you

Play on!

Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
