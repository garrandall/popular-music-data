Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine
Singin'


Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me


If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you
Sing it now


(Joy) to the world
(All) the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
(Joy to you and me)


You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider (ha ha ha)
And a straight-shooting son of a gun (alright)
I said a straight shootin' (son of a gun)


(Joy to the world)
(All the boys and girls)
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)


(Joy to the world)
(All the boys and girls)
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)


(Joy to the world)
(All the boys and girls)
(Joy to the world)
(Joy to you and me)


(Joy to the world)
(All the boys and girls) now
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)
Ah yeah!


(Joy to the world) yeah YEAH!
(All the boys and girls) Yowwwww
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)
You know I mean to


(Joy to the world) Yeah! Yeah!
(All the boys and girls)
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)
You know I mean to


(Joy to the world) You know I mean to
(All the boys and girls) Yeah yeah
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me) Wahhh yeah


(Joy to the world) Let me tell ya 'bout it
(All the boys and girls)
