He got lonely every time the cantina lights came up on the Indian Casino Queen
'Cause he'd loved her from the time she'd been the waitress at the Mexican place where he'd left his keys

She'd been there smiling at the lost and found
Then he took her to see Three Dog Night
They were playing at the fairgrounds
Holding hands singing "Joy to the World"

She was way too young but he did not care
He was all right with cashing in a few fine moments before his broken heart kicked in

He died a little bit each time the night came in
And the stars fell over Michigan
'Cause held loved her at the bar when he saw her dancing to
"I Could Never Take the Place of your Man"

Then he'd come over to his usual spot
Soon they were making out at 3AM in the empty parking lot
They lay together under the burnt out stars

She never loved him back
I wasn't even close
But he was fine to just pretend
That it was never gonna end
And it was worth it just to know
A little warmth before the snow
