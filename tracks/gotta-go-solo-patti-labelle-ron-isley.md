Raindrops on my window seal (well, well, well)
It's quiet as a mouse in here (oh, oh, oh
You're somewhere with the girls doing nails
Dinner's takeout, no homecooking all year
Ain't no use pretending (no, no)
'Cause perfect I know I have not been
But there's gotta be a way to work things out (oh)
Twenty years, should remove all doubt


 If you love me, (I love you) then how could you go
 It's not about the love, it's just I've had enough maybe we need to let it go
 If you ever loved me, (I love you baby) then how could you leave
 some songs have gotta end, we're better off as friends maybe it's time I go solo


I know this is confusing to you (very, very, very)
But it's been coming for a mighty long time (a mighty long time)
A woman needs to be loved
Head to toe
Body, soul, and mind
You've been taking me for granted (have I really?)
No surprises, no flowers on rainy days
Now I can keep u just the way you are
But I know some things will never change


 if you love me(I love you baby)then how could you go
 it's not about the love it's just I've had enough maybe we need to let it go
 hey, if you ever loved me(I love you baby) then how could you leave
 some songs have gotta end we're better off as friends maybe it's time I go solo solo solo


 I can't sing this melody no more, I've sung it for so long
 Is it the chorus, the verse, or the bridge.(I don't know)just tell me exactly what it is
 Ron we're over troubled waters I can just show it's over


 if you love me (oh, Ron I still love you baby) then how could you go
 Hew, it's not about the love it's just I've had enough maybe we need to let it go, let it go
 if you ever loved me(Oh, Ron you know I love ya) then how could you leave
 some songs have gotta end we're better off as friends Mrs. Patti's gotta go solo... solo

 Breakdown
 If you ever loved me
 I love you baby, Ron I love you
 Oh, oh, oh how could you leave
 That a right, I'm gonna tell you why
You been Mr. Bigg
You been Mr. Bigg too long
Now honey here's Mrs. Bigg
 talk to me
 That's what I've been doing all for twenty long years
 Yeah
