Outside is cloudy but I like that better
Behind the wheel but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today

Without any complications
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated?
Well I'm way too young to be getting old

And all I wanna do is look but I can't see, baby
Who you talking to while you talking to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy

Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered
I try but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day

Without any complications
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated?
Well I'm way too young to be getting old

Some people say they want to live forever
Without any complications

Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated?
Well I'm way too young to be getting old
