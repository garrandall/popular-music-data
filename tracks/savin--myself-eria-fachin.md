Seeing you today
Was quite a surprise
And when you saw my friend
You couldn't disguise your feelings
Even tough you broke my heart
I guess you thought I'd always love you
Now it hurts
That I found someone new

What did you think I would do?
Sit all alone by the telephone?
Wait for the day that you might come home
Savin' myself for you

Now did you really believe
I never looked at another guy
C`mon that night and you sit to cry
Savin' myself for you

After you were gone
I realized my life was moving on
You`d be surprised
How quickly people start to come around
You'd never know that I'd be lonely
Couldn't help fall in love again

What did you think I would do?
Sit all alone by the telephone?
Wait for the day that you might come home
Savin' myself for you

Now did you really believe
I never looked at another guy
C`mon that night and you sit to cry
Savin' myself for you

Now you gave your heart to someone else
And threw our love away
So I found myself for another love
And I know it`s gonna stay
