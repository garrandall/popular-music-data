Everyone that I can see is gettin' right in tow 
Changin' songs to be on the radio 
Now there are things that I believe in 
I'd never sell my soul 
It always feels so good to hear good music

I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music

How can I get back to you when I'm so far from home 
In any port or foreign shore-alone 
So many ways to be betrayed believe me when I say 
I think that I would die without good music

I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
I know that I would die without good music

I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
I know that I would die without good music

And even though you might think it's funny 
I couldn't care if there ain't no money 
I'm a little mixed up 
But I'll be alright 
If I can hear a loud guitar all night 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music
