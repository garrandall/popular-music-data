You said hello and loneliness said goodbye then
It made me so glad that I almost had to cry then
I never believed in love at first sight
But when you held me tight that night
I knew with you it wasn't a lie

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

Your soul was sweet your lips were warm and tender
I wanted your kiss I couldn't resist surrender
I could have sworn that violins played
'Cause when the rhythm swayed with you so near
I heard the sound of your sigh

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

I heard you sighin'
I felt like cryin'
You weren't lying
No no
What a sweet thing that was
And then I heard you whisper the word forever
I knew that we'd spend the rest of our lives together
That feeling we shared
Was too much to bear
And when you said you cared, I swear
I felt that I was ready to die

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing that was
