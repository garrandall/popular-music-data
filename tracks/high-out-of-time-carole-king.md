High out of time
I wish the years away
Look into your eyes
And you look into mine
All my sorrows disappear
When I'm high out of time

High out of time
Is a place I like to be
I'm a part of you
And you're a part of me
And I can hold you near
When I'm high out of time

No use wondering where the years have gone
Time waits for no one, we all have to go on
But every now and then I look up an old friend
And come home to someplace I used to belong

High out of time
The world becomes so new
Horizons that we've crossed
I cross again with you
Traveling through the years
When I'm high out of time
