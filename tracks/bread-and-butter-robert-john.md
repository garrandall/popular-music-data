He likes bread and butter
He likes toast and jam
That's what his baby feeds him
He's her lovin' man

Oh I like bread and butter
And I like toast and jam
That's what my baby feeds me
And I'm her lovin' man

He likes bread and butter
He likes toast and jam
That's what his baby feeds him
He's her lovin' man

Well she don't cook mashed potatoes
She don't cook T-bone steak
She don't feed me peanut butter
She knows that I can't take

He likes bread and butter
He likes toast and jam
That's what his baby feeds him
He's her lovin' man

Well well well
I got home early one morning
Much to my surprise
She was eatin' chicken and dumplings
With some other guy

No more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
He found his baby eating
With some other man

No no no no more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
I found my baby eating
With some other man

No more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
He found his baby eating
With some other man

No more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
He found his baby eating
With some other man

No more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
 He found his baby eating...
