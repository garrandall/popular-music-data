Wake yo' punk-ass up for the '93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin' house, gyeah
And it ain't nothin' but a Compton thing, y'all
And we ain't nothin' but Niggas On Tha Run
And this goes out to my niggas, gyeah


A fucked up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Hm, somebody help me
But nah, they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin', 'cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got Moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas puttin' brew in my fuckin' baby bottle
Damn! And through all the motherfuckin' pain
They done drove my moms insane
So, I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah


Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace


Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder
That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under
Gyeah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' (Japs)
See a bitch in the right lane, so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
Sayin': "Play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!"
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers
And my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah, motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah


Uhh, whassup, y'all?
Streiht up menace
Damn!
Really, really
Streiht up menace
Damn!


I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'you can get the fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay, 'cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do?
The homies say: "The hood's where it's good
Homeboy, I thought you knew."
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, gyeah


Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace
Damn!


And on and on
I guess we outta here
Peace to my niggas on the run
And it ain't nothin' but streiht up menaces, damn!
Just like I said before, y'all
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thing
And MC Eiht's in the house for the '93 shot
And this one's for the niggas, gyeah
