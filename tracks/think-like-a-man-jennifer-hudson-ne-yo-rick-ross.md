In love, love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man


Why you call me your dream bed
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen, babe
That's why you needed me, baby

But in between lust and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we, babe
There's just you and there's me baby

There was us,
there was trust,
there was heaven;
it changed, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us, why'd I wait

but in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man
In love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man


Now I'mma keep it realer with you now than I've ever been
we shoulda never been, girl we was better friends
You didn't have to tell me, what; where, why and when
I didn't either cause you wasn't my girlfriend
We had a good thing
You would come by and kick it
Give me that good thing
Then after we were finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what in the hell made us
Think this was gon' be better
And now I'm telling you lies
All because I hate to see the tears in your eyes
Of course I want my cake, and eat it too, I'm a guy
And of course, you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man

but in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man
In love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man


Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace linen got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my Mona Lisa
Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in Barney show and tell
Bentley backing out of Neiman's, seen her pony tail
5 karat yellow diamond, you don't know me well
Penthouse, at the Trump, sit on Collins Ave
She caught an attitude, I had to call the cab
You don't understand this altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood where the owners at

So different but the same
Boy, you taught me everything
Yeah you show me how you think
You're the only one to blame
It's such a shame
Yeah should lost the game you tell me how to play

In love, in love, in love, love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man
In love, in love, in love, love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man
