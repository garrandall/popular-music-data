I get to thinking lots of times
About back when I was a lad
Of the old home-place where I growed up;
Of the days both good and bad

My overalls was hand-me-downs
Y shoes was full of holes
And I used to walk four miles to school every day
Through the rain and the sleet and the cold

I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a bad-lands farm
And seven hungry mouths to feed

And yet, and yet out home-fire never flickered once
'Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn-book down
And mama sang a song

(What a friend we have in Jesus.)

I been rocked to sleep many a night
To the tune of "What A Friend"
TO THE TUNE OF "WHAT A FRIEND"; come morning
"Rock of Ages" would waken me gentle once again

Then dad, he'd reach up and take the bible down
And read it, read it loud and long
I always thought that maybe our our home was blessed
When daddy would say, "Mamma, sing a song."

Sister left home first, I guess
Then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
Then dad's hair was turnin' white
'N I had to be mama's little man

But it seemed that as daddy's back growed weak
Mother's faith just growed strong
And them were the greatest days of all
When mama samg a song

(Rock of ages, cleft for me.)
(Let me hide myself in thee.)...
OOH, OOH, OOH. (Through Recitation)

I guess the house is still standing;
I don't get back much no more
No voice is left to fill them halls
'N no steps to grace the floor

You see, my mama sings in heaven now
Around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe this world
Is a better place because, one time
My mama sang a song
