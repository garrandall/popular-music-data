You say a little love just isn't
Enough for you
Sometimes I feel lucky just to get a little
Coming through

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running away

A little love here makes me want to stay
A little love there'll keep me from running away
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love

Well, you thought you had it beat
But it didn't seem to last that long
Now you're back out on the street
But you've got to keep hanging on

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running away

A little love here makes me want to stay
A little love there'll keep me from running away
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love

Well, I know it's hard, my friend
But the hurt can heal and your heart will mend
And this world keeps dragging you down
But love can bring you round and round
And round and round again

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running
Sometimes I feel like running away

A little love here makes me want to stay
(Just a little love)
A little love there'll keep me from running away
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love

A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
A little love, a little little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love

A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
A little love, a little little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love

I get a little love, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
A little love here, a little love there
Give a little, get a little, just a little love
