Make the music play
Just a little slower
Play a little slower
Let him hold me in his arms
A little longer

Make the music play
Just a little softer
Play a little softer
Let him hear me when I sigh
How much I love him

Make the music play
Keep teh magic going
Keep the love-light glowing
Within his arms
Don’t even skip a beat
Or he may get away
And if we were parted
I'd be broken-hearted
Til I’m in his arms to stay
Please make the music play
Let him hear me when I sigh
How much I love him

Make the music play
Keep the magic going
Keep the love-light glowing
