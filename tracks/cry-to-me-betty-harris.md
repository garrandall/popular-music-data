When your babe leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone

Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Like crying, like crying
Come on, baby, cry to me

When you're all alone
In your lonely room
Whoa, when there's nothing
But the smell of her perfume

Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Like crying, like crying
Come on, babe, cry to me

Nothing can be so low
Than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness (loneliness)
Loneliness (loneliness)
It's a waste of time

Whoa, no, you don't ever
I said you don't ever
I know you don't ever
Have to walk alone
Can't you see

Aw, come on, baby
Come on baby, come on
Come on, come on, walk with me

When you're waiting
For a voice to come
Late, late, late in the night
But there is no one

Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Like crying, like crying

Come on, babe, come on
Come on, cry to me
