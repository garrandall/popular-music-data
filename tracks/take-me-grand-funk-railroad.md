Come and dance with me, take me all the higher
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music
Come make love with me

Oh
CHORUS
Come on, take me, take me, and make me feel your music
Wanna get in deep when it tastes so sweet
Wanna lose my head tonight
Come on, take me, take me, make me feel your music
Well we ain't gonna stop if we're feelin' hot
Gotta' lose our heads tonight

How many times I tried to make it happen?
But you always find a way to say good-night
Tonight we're here alone, your mama's out, there's nobody home
I'm a harmless kinda crazy so it's alright

CHORUS

I've seen you give me looks that I've read about in books
And I finally had to make you play your hand
There's a reason that you're here, and I think it's perfectly clear
But it don't take much to make me understand

Come and dance with me, take me all the higher
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music
Come make love with me, come make love, make love with me

Oh
CHORUS

CHORUS
(to fade)
