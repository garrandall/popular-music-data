There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat
Running out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine


This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run


There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright


This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run


This time I'm ready to run
I’d give everything that I’ve got for your love


This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run
