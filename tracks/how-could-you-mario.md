It's kinda crazy babe
How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)


You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me)
(Love made me blind, baby) but now I see
(you had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me) I even heard it from your family


How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?


You must be out your mind
You got a lot of nerve (to think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard)
I damn near carried you
I could've married you
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you


(I know your sick about) the way I found you out
(Go head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me



How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you??
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??
