I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you; I couldn't stand the pain


The road to love has tragedies
Some loves don't get to be
Laying the tears in someone's eyes, I won't cry


And it could happen to us if we're not strong
So why don't we hurry to love before it's gone


I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain


The gates are open, we're so close
Love is almost ours to hold
A few more steps and we'll be there, if you care


We'll make it together, it's easier that way
With two falling deeper love will soon be ours to stay


I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
