And every time I get to thinkin'
With every thought of you, I wanna shout aloud
And then I think about the love I had inside me
How you brought what's inside out

So now love's made it to the outside
I wanna tell the world of everything I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You've turned my living upside-down

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy is it bright?
Is it day or is it night?
Am I wrong or am I right?
And is it real?

Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Baby, now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside-down but ten feet tall

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy is it bright?
Is it day or is it night?
Am I wrong or am I right?
And is it real?

On and on I drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You filled my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy is it bright?
Is it day or is it night?
Am I wrong or am I right?
And is it real?

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy is it bright?
Is it day or is it night?
Am I wrong or am I right?
And is it real?
