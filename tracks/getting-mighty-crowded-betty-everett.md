I'm packing up my memories
And I'm gonna move
On out of your heart

Turning in my keys
And I'm gonna move
On out of your heart

Cause there ain't
Room enough for two
And sharing your heart
With someone new
Will never do

It's getting mighty crowded
I'm telling you
It's getting mighty crowded

Gonna take these dreams of mine
And I'm gonna move
On out of your life

Stop wasting my time
And I'm gonna move
On out of your life

Cause there ain't
Room enough for three
In dreams that were
Made for you and me
And so you see

It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded

I'm saving you the trouble
Of putting me down
Start on the double, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna shop around

Find myself another heart
Where I can live all by myself
Gonna find myself a heart
I don't have to share with nobody else

Cause you didn't treat me
Like you should
And sticking around this neighborhood
Is just no good

It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm packing up my memories

It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded, mm hm
It's getting might crowded
