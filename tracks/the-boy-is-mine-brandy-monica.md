The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine

 Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute
 uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
 Yeah, you do too but, umm
I just wanted to know do you know
Somebody named you
You know his name
 Oh, yeah definitely I know his name
 I just wanted to let you know he's mine
 Huh...no no, he's mine


The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

 - I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake him for your man
Are you insane?
 - See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
Cause' you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
 - See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day
Ain't that a shame
 - And maybe you misunderstood
Plus I can't see how he could
Wanna take his time and that's all good
All of my love was all it took


The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

 - Must you do the things you do
Keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
 - I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
 - You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
 - When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine


The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

 - You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
 - What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start


The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

 He belongs to me
 The boy is mine, not yours
 But mine!
 Not yours!
 But mine!
 Not yours!
 But mine!

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
