(Brandy) Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute
(Monica) Uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
(Brandy) Yeah, you do too but um... I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...
You know his name
(Monica) Oh yeah definitely, I know his name
(Brandy) I just want to let you know that he's mine

(Monica) Uh, no no, he's mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me

The boy is mine
(Brandy)
I think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk, face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man

Are you insane
(Monica)
See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see

That his love is all in me
(Brandy)
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day

Ain't that a shame
(Monica)
Well maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good

All of my love was all it took
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me

The boy is mine
(Monica)
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you

And if you didn't know it, girl it's true
(Brandy)
I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life

I know it's killing you inside
(Monica)
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth you can't escape

I can tell the real from the fake
(Brandy)
When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Anyway it's my time to shine

If you didn't know it the boy is mine
(Monica)
Can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine, without a doubt

You might as well throw in the towel
(Brandy)
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
This special places in my heart

Cause he was my love, right from the start
(Brandy) He belongs to me (sang in)
(Monica) The boy is mine, not yours (after)
(Monica) Not yours
(Brandy) But mine
(Monica) Not yours
(Brandy) But mine
(Monica) Not yours
(Brandy) But mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
