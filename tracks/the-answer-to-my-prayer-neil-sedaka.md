I was lonely, couldn't sleep at night
So I wished for you with all my might
You're the one I've waited for
Now I'll never be alone any more

You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer
Now at last my search is through
Now I know the answer to my prayer is you

You're an angel, I'm a lucky guy
Prayin' that we never say goodbye
Still I wonder, is it true?
Am I really standing here holding you?

You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer
Now at last my search is through
Now I know the answer to my prayer is you

Still I wonder, is it true?
Am I really standing here holding you?

You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer
Now at last my search is through
Now I know the answer to my prayer is you

You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer
You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer
You're the answer to my prayer
I've found the answer to my prayer...
