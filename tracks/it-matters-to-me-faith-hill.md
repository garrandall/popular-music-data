Baby, tell me where'd you ever learn
To fight without saying a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like it's all gonna be alright
Don't you know how much it hurts?


When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see?
It matters to me


Maybe I still don't understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
'Cause I'm not sure I can


When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see?
It matters to me

Oh, when I don't know what to say, don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see?
Oh, it matters to me
Oh, it matters to me
It matters to me
