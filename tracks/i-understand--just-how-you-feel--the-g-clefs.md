The G-Clefs

Peaked at # 9 in 1961
Previously charted in 1954 by The Four Tunes (#6) and June Valli (# 8)
Later charted by Freddie and the Dreamers at # 36 in 1965
See NOTES below

I understand just how you feel
Your love for me, why not be mine?
It's over now but it was grand
I understand, I understand

If you ever change your mind
Come back to me and you will find
Me waiting there, at your command
I understand, I understand

I miss you so, please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know

If you ever change your mind
Come back to me and you will find
Me waiting there at your command
I understand, I understand

SPOKEN: "I understand just how you feel. Let bygones be bygones. But always
Remember I love
You, I love you, I love you."

(We'll sip a cup of wine, my dear, for Auld Lang Syne)
I understand

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES: The Scottish folk song "Auld Lang Syne" is sung
Throughout by
Backup singers. Some versions may NOT have the "Auld Lang Syne" part and may
Also include an alternate last in lieu of the second "If you ever change your
Mind". The alternate lyrics are:

Please understand just how I feel
Your love for me why not reveal
And we will know this time it's real
We'll understand
