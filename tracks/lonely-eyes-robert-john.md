Across the crowded room
See her sitting all alone
Looking like an angel
With no place to call home

Stiking up a conversation
They begin by trading names
She begins to smile
And they begin to play the game

She's heard every line
They're a dozen for a dime
But tonight she's gonna listen
One more time

Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
She's seen too many nights
Too many lovers
Maybe tonight won't be
Like all the others

Sad lines on her face
Show a lonesome midnight queen
Nothing left to hope for
Nothing left to dream

And lately all her lovers
Have begun to look the same
Names that have no faces
Faces without names

She's heard every line
They're a dozen for a dime
But tonight she's gonna listen
One more time

Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
She's seen too many nights
Too many lovers
Maybe tonight won't be
Like all the others

It's hard to face the morning
With a stranger by your side
But late at night it's easier
To overcome her pride

So she tells him that she loves him
She says she knew it from the start
But they both know she's lying
It's not coming from the heart

Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
She's seen too many nights
Too many lovers
Maybe tonight won't be
Like all the others

Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
