I wanna rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
I want to rock (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)


"Turn it down," you say?
Well all I got to say to you is
Time and time again I say, No! (No!)
No, No, No, No, No!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to you
When you tell me not to play, I say, "No!"
No! No, No, No, No, No!


So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you


I wanna rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
I want to rock (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)


There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't
Nothin' in the world that makes me go! (Go!)
Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could
Hear my favorite song so let's go! (Go!)
Go, go, go, go, go!


When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do


I wanna rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
I want to rock (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)


I wanna rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
I want to rock (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
Rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock!




I wanna rock! (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)
I want to rock (Rock)
I wanna rock! (Rock)


I wanna rock! (Rock)
