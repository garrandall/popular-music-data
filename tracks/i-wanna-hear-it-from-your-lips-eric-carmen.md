I hear it from my friends
I hear it on the street

I hear it in the air here and there

everywhere and from everyone I meet
And everytime I hear you love me
oh
my heart skips.

But I wanna hear it from your lips

You never told me
you never told me.
I wanna hear it from your lips
you never told me.

I hear it in my car
I hear it on the phone

I hear it in a crowd nice and loud

But lately now I hear it when I'm all alone.
And everytime I hear you love me
oh
my heart skips.
But I wanna hear it from your lips
...

Now everybody's been told and the whole world knows
Just how good our love is gonna be.
But oh
wee
oh
wee
baby
baby
you never told me

you never told me.
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch

You even found a way you can say all you need

but you never say too much.
And if you'd only say you'd love me
oh
my heart would flip.

And I wanna hear it from your lips
you never told me

you never told me.
I wanna hear it from your lips
you never told me

you never told me.
I wanna hear it from your lips
you never told me

you never told me...
