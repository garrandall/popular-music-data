Ay, Ay, Ay
Nobody likes being played
Beyonce, Beyonce
Shakira, Shakira (hey)

 He said I'm worth it, his one desire
 I know things about 'em that you wouldn't wanna read about
 He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful Liar
 Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

 You never know
 Why are we the ones who suffer
 I have to let go
 He won't be the one to cry

 (Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
 Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar

 I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
 I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again
 I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
 You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

 You never know
 When the pain and heartbreak's over
 I have to let go
 The innocence is gone

 (Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
 Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar

 Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
 And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
(Both) But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

Beyonce Beyonce
Shakira Shakira

(Hey)

 (Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
 Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar
