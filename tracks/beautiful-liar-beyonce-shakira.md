Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey


Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar


He said I'm worth it, his one desire
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful liar


You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry


(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar
Just a beautiful liar


I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing


We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone


(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it?
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it?
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar


Beyoncé, Beyoncé

Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira
