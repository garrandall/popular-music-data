There you go baby, and here am I
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Golly gee, what have you done to me?
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore

Do you remember baby, last September
How you held me tight, each and every night?
Oh baby, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

There is no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you

Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, till the end of time
And I'll find somebody new, and baby
We'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore

There is no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you

Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, till the end of time
And I'll find somebody new, and baby
We'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore

(you won't matter anymore)
No you won't matter anymore
(you won't matter anymore)
No you won't matter anymore
You won't matter anymore
