Georgia, Georgia, whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Talking 'bout Georgia
I'm in Georgia, song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pines

Other arms they reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, sweet Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
Oh the road leads back
It always leads back, leads back to you

I'm in Georgia, Georgia, sweet Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old sweet song
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
Just an old sweet, sweet, sweet song
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind
