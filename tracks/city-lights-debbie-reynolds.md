The bright array of city lights
As far as I can see
The Great White Way
Shines through the night
For lonely guys like me

The cabarets and honky tonks
Their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself
In the glow of city lights

Lights that say forget her name
In a glass of sherry wine
Lights that offer other girls
For empty hearts like mine

They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights

The lights that say forget her love
In a different atmosphere
The lights that lure are nothing but
A masquerade for tears

They paint a pretty picture
But my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you
To a street of city lights
