Farewell, my Tani
Child of a coral sea
We dreamed of heaven
But you've forgotten me

I loved you dearly
Why did we have to part?
Now I am lonely
Here with a broken heart

Once on silver sands
We held lonesome hands
That's why, my Tani
I cried "Come back to me"

Once on silver sands
We held lonesome hands
That's why, my Tani
I cried "Come back to me"...
