You're the entertainer
The entertainer
You're the entertainer
The entertainer

You made em laugh
And you left em feeling glad
You made em cry
And you left em feeling sad

They've seen you perform
In so many plays
But they're not to know
You're unhappy today

So they'll never know
Go on with the show

Cause you're the entertainer
The entertainer
You're the entertainer
The entertainer

The curtain's up and
Your audience is waiting out there
Now walk on stage, boy
Like you don't have a care

And don't let em know
That you're feeling so low
Since your girl put you down
You're a sad hearted clown

But the show must go on
Go on and on

Cause you're the entertainer
The entertainer
You're the entertainer
The entertainer, yeah

Now hear that applause
Now you know you made the grade
You fooled them well
For the money they paid

Now walk off in style
And don't forget to smile
Though your heart tells you frown
You can't let the people down

Sure, your one girl has gone
But you've got to walk on
When you're the entertainer
Tell yourself

You're the entertainer
You know you can do it
You're the entertainer
Walk on in style now

You're the entertainer
Come on, in style now
You're the entertainer...
