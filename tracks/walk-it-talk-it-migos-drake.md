Yeah, yeah (Deko)
Woah, hold on (OG Parker)
Uh

Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)

Walk it, walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (ayy)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (yeah)

Take my shoes and walk a mile
Something that you can't do (woo, hey)
Big talks of the town, big boy gang moves (gang moves)
I like to walk around with my chain loose (chain, chain)
She just bought a new ass but got the same boobs (same boobs)
Whipping up dope, scientist
(Whip it up, whip it up, cook it up, cook it up, skrr, skrr)
That's my sauce, where you find it?
(That's my sauce, look it up, look it up, find it)
Adding up checks, no minus
(Add it up, add it up, add it up, add it up, yeah)
Get your respect in diamonds (ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice)
I bought a Plain Jane Rollie
These niggas bought they fame (woo)
I think my back got scoliosis 'cause I swerve the lane (skrr)
Heard you signed your life for that brand new chain (I heard)
Think it came with stripes
But you ain't straight with the gang (gang, gang)

Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it


Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we been beefing dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home
(She at home now!) That was that
So I can't be beefing with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you living in a mansion in all your raps, though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa
Name ringing like a Migo trap phone, whoa
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's
That's on Tommy Campos, we live like Sopranos and Iâ


Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it


Woo, woo, woo, Offset
Niggas pocket watching (watching)
I want that thot, this thot, mÃ©naging (which one?)
I bought a franchise to double up the profits (franchise)
We make a land slide, chopper get to popping (landslide)
Eliott got me rocky
Blow a socket, chicken teriyaki (brr)
Take off rocket, keep 'em in pocket
Water gon' lock it, quadruple the profit (profit)
I walk like I walk (hey) talk like I talk (woah)
What's in my vault? Load of cash and assaults (brr!)
I put a lab in my loft (lab)
She cook up and jab with the fork (jab)
By the pair, I got karats that choke (by the pair)
By the pair, I got karats each lobe (by the pair)
Private life, private jets 'round the globe (private life)
Hit a bitch, hit a lick with the 'cho (hey)


Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it


Watch it buck, no Milwaukee (hunnid)
Walk it, like I talk it
That's my bro, he know the lingo (lingo)
Ain't no walkie-talkie (no)
This some, "You know, why don't we know?" (We know?)
Hold out on that coffee
Smoke the cookie, get the coughing
Drop-dead fresh, I need a coffin
Balling, something we do often (ball)
Take the pot and I'm splashing up, dolphin (splash)
I take the nine and go buy me a faucet (nine)
Walk it like I talk it, a nigga done bought it (uh)
I play the coach so I gotta call it (call it)
Up in the shits, some niggas just dormant (shits)
Walk in the building, they start applauding (applauding)
I get a rebound, I ain't talking about Spalding (ball)


Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it, walk it, walk it like I talk it
