Monday's promise is Tuesday's lie Saturday's party is Sunday's fight
Somethin's wrong with you and I love's gone wrong that used to be right
And I can feel it slippin' away slowly slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days if we don't stop this love of ours from slippin' away

Wednesday's kisses are Thursday's frowns we can't live two days in a row
When our world's not upside down here we stand watchin' it go
And I can feel it slippin' away...

Roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzle's missin' a piece or two we've got the grapes but never the wine
And I can feel it slippin' away...
And I can feel it slippin' away...
And I can feel it slippin' away...
