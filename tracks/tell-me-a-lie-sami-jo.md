Tell me a lie say I look familiar
Though I know that you don't even know my name
Tell me a lie say you just got into town
Even though I've seen you here before just hangin' round
Tell me a lie say you're not a married man
Even though I saw you slip off your weddin' band
Tell me a lie say you got no place to stay
You'll be glad to drop me off 'cause it's on your way

Tell me a lie when you take me home
(Tell me a lie) I don't really wanna spend the night alone
Tell me a lie don't worry about my sorrow you'll be long gone tomorrow
Then you won't not to see me cry tell me a lie

Tell me a lie tell me that you need me
And I could tell me it's not real the way you want me to
C'mon tell me a lie when you're lyin' close beside me
And whisper when you hold me sweet words like I love you
Mhm, tell me a lie when the night is almost over
Make it easy on us both when it's time for you to go
Tell me a lie say you really like to stay
Tell me please just one more time that you'll be back someday

Tell me a lie when you take me home
(Tell me a lie) I don't really wanna spend the night alone
Tell me a lie don't worry about my sorrow you'll be long gone tomorrow
Then you won't not to see me cry tell me a lie
