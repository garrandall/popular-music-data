I was born in a bunk
My mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

I grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a-hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road (Tobacco Road)

I'm gonna leave and get a job (Tobacco Road)
With the help and the grace from above (Tobacco Road)
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road (Tobacco Road)

Bring Dynamite and a crane (Tobacco Road)
Blow it up and start all over again (Tobacco Road)
Build a town be proud to show (Tobacco Road)
Give it the name of Tobacco Road

But it's home (It's home)
The only life I've ever known (Ever known)
Only you know how I loathe (Only you, how I loathe)
But it's home (It's home)
The only life I've ever known (Ever known)
That I despise and disapprove of you (Tobacco Road)
Is to love you (Tobacco Road)
'Cause it's home (Tobacco Road)
'Cause it's home (Tobacco Road)
'Cause it's home (Tobacco Road)
It's home (Tobacco Road)
