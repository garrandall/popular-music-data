I was born - in a bunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to - die or grow
In the middle of "Tobacco Road"

Grew up in - up rusty shack
All I had was a-hangin' on my back
Only you know - how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

'Cause it's home - the only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road

Break

Gonna leave - get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money get - rich and old
Bring it back to "Tobacco Road"

Bring dynamite - and a crane
Blow it up start all over again
Build a town be - proud to show
Give the name "Tobacco Road"

'Cause it's home - the only life I've ever known
I despise you 'cause yer filthy
But I love you - 'cause yer home

END
