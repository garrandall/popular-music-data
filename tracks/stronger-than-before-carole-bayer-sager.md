If you don't believe what I say
You won't believe I'm not that way
And I never meant to turn the hurt around
I would be a fool to lose the love I'd found
And if you take me back, I'll let you know

I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me

If you heard the whole thing before
Then once again, I'll tell you more
I would be a fool to ever let you go
Oh I had to go away to finally know
How much I need you back, I need your love

I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me

If you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back
If you come back to me, come back to me

(Stronger, stronger) Stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me

(Stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)
By the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me

(Stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (oh yeah, yeah)
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
