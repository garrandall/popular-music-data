Yo, after tonight...
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah yeah
You smell it? Hah yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh


Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it


Meanwhile I
I loved you, you were my girl
You see, I
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby


You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight


Aw, girl, your face is saying, "Why?"
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listening to friends
Now it's the end
And again, no story can end without it


Damn right...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see, I
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby


You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight


Gonna boogie, tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waiting for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party, yeah, oh yeah


You don't have to call (you don't gotta call)
It's okay, girl (It's okay, girl)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight (I'ma be alright hah)
You don't have to call (you ain't gotta call)
It's okay, girl (I'm okay girl)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
Tonight I'm going out with my nigga oh yeah, hah
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl (I'm alright girl, hah!)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight (I'm alright)


Gonna boogie, tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waiting for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party, yeah, yeah, hah!


You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
You don't have to call (hah)
It's okay, girl (It's okay, I'ma be alright)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You don't have to call
It's okay girl (It's okay, girl)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
(Sick and tired of being home, I'm gonna have me some fun)
You don't have to call (hey, hey, yeah)
It's okay, girl (it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's alright)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight


I'm not waiting at home for you
Bye bye
