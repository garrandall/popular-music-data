The game bout to change
Usher
Woah man (yall are somethin else)
Yeah
A lotta women
You know they say yall do it better than us (and I learned from the best man)
Because we only see what youre doin
But I see ya.
Where we at?
This right here is for my triple Gs with the double DDs
Go get em girls (haha, yeah man)
You know who you are
Where we at? (Over here lookin how we lookin)
Aint that right? (Huh, yeah)
Go get em girls (I see you)


I profess Im a lover minor scholar of anatomy
Doctor of feminine chemistry
Got a healthy fascination for a multitude relation with plenty women thats ?
And it happens every once in a while, I go too deep that I gotta shut it down
She keep on comin by, wont quit on callin, its safe to say that shes fallin
She pleadin, she dont want me to leave
I had to tell her


No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you dont love me no more
Thats when I be like


Lovin me baby thats a no-no (no-no)
Im better when I touch and go
Im trying to add yo name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, Im a pro lover (lover)


As a quick pro call we can both come and go
This aint about fidelity (uh-uh)
Thought I was a pimp, player, hustler, baller (huh)
Woah man, she a G (yeah) and do it better than me (do it better than us, man)
When it happens then every once in awhile
She gon cook just to hook you for a while
Cant escape, take your pick, either way youre a trip cause
Man, if she layin for it, that means you payin for it


No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you dont love me no more
Thats when I be like


Lovin me baby thats a no-no (no-no)
Im better when I touch and go
Im trying to add yo name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, Im a pro lover (lover)


Tick-tock, better hurry, times runnin out
So you better be sure before we lay down
Knock-knock, Daddys home, open up girl
I can tell that its been awhile, youve been waiting
Come through it so many times (with women that I do it)
Aint tryin to make you mine (but I like the feeling)
Thats gon be honest baby, we dont go through drama here baby
Cause when you give it up, you gon get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind


How many of you like that (keep on asking me for more)
(More, more, more)


Lovin me baby thats a no-no (no-no)
Im better when I touch and go
Im trying to add yo name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, Im a pro lover (lover)

Not just a player, Im a pro lover (lover)
Not just a player, Im a pro lover (lover)


Better ask somebody (Players, real Gs feel me on this one)
Aint that right girl, yeah (Not just a player, Im a pro lover)
Lover (not just a player, Im a pro)
I know you got it baby
Biggest player in the world
Yeah, you know who you are
