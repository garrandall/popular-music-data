Last night they held a beauty contest
And crowned my girl the best

She was voted the
Teen Queen of the Week
Now she won't even speak to me
Teen Queen of the Week
Success went to her head

Nominated the
Starlet of the Month
Hasn't got the time of day for me
Starlet of the Month
I wish that I was dead, yeah

Popularity, you've got it
The whole darn world's your balloon
I'll be your flunky
Uh your trained monkey
While the organ grinder calls the tune

I'm elected the
Prize Fool of the Year
'Cause I'll stay waitin' here for you
Teen Queen of the Week
'Til you find a weak spot for me

(La-la-la-la, la, la)
(La-la, la-la)
(La-la-la-la, la, la)
(La-la, la-la)
(La-la-la-la, la, la)
(La-la, la-la)
(La-la, la, la, la, la)

Yeah, popularity, you've got it
The whole darn world's your balloon
I'll be your flunky
Your trained monkey
While the organ grinder calls the tune

I'm elected the
Prize Fool of the Year
'Cause I'll stay waitin' here for you
Teen Queen of the Week
'Til you find a weak spot for me

La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la, la, la, la

La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la, la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la, la, la, la
