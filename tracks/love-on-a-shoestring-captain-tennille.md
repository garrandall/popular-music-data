We've been here before
Like a book I read in the hall that leads to your door
And my words hang in the air
Like the smoke when I spoke to you

And I said before you come to bed
Take off your ring
My heart's on a thread
And love's on a shoestring

And I've been down to the wire
That's the way my luck has been
But I can't put out this fire
Let the loser win

I still look for your face
On the overcoat I used to walk to your place
It's good to know that you're doing well
Did you hear, was it clear to you?

When I said before you come to bed
Take off your ring
My heart's on a thread
And love's on a shoestring

And when I look in your eyes
I can hear them sing
There are no ties
With love on a shoestring

And I said before you come to bed
Take off your ring
My heart is on a thread
And love's on a shoestring

And when I look in your eyes
I can hear them sing
There are no ties
With love on a shoestring

There are no ties
With love on a shoestring
