Oh baby
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls
It's on 
All the pretty girls, in the world
And the ugly girls too
'Cause to me you're pretty anyway baby

You give me your number, I call you up
You act like your pussy don't interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fucking me
But I have a little problem with you not fucking me

Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
'Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No, it's bad bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch

So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitches, niggas put away your pistols
Dirty won't be having it in this house
'Cause bitch I'll cripple your style

Now that you heard my charming voice
You couldn't get another nigga, coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy,
girl you better give me that money


Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money

Yo! So I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear, "You wanna be with me?
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know"

Just dance! If you caught up in the Holy Ghost trance
If you stop! I'mma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watching me

I don't want no problems 'cause I put you down
In the ground where you cannot be found
I'm just dirt dog trying to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey

Radios play this all day, everyday
Recognize I'm a fool and you love me!
None of you nuh better look at me funny
Nuh you know my name now give me my money!


Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
(sing it, sing it girls!)
Don't you worry, I said hey.
(Just shake it right now!)
Baby I got your money
(if Dirty want his money)
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
(I think you all should give him his money)
Don't you worry, I said hey.
(that's how I like girl)
Baby I got your money

Sexy, sexy, sexy!
Sexy, sexy, sexy!
Sexy, sexy, sexy!
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

Yo, yo!
Nigga playing in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out let me hold it tight
You looking at my wrist saying, "It's so nice."
The price bitch is diamonds shining disco light

Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'mma get this money and rob them
Lucky dog when I won the lotto
Ran up on my car for carrying rollo

But hold on you can call me Dirty,
and then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty,
god made dirt and dirt bust your ass

Stop annoying me, yeah! I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard Ol' Dirty, to move the crowd
They say he had his dick in his mouth
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money!


Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
Baby I got your money
Hey, Dirty, baby I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey.
