Charlie drives a brand new Mercedes Benz
He's got another one just like it, just like all his friends
His wife is playin' tennis and his kids are off at school
He drives home to his empty house and sits by his empty swimming pool

But, he's got power windows. He's got power brakes
He's got a power bed. Push a button and it shakes
He's got no one to talk to and tears rolling down his face
He's ain't got the power of love...

Louis drives a beat up '69 Dart
Swears it's the statue of Mary that keeps the car from falling apart
With Gracie right beside him sittin' closer than a smile
She's got her head on his shoulder
He loves to drive and hold her

He got no power windows. Got no power brakes
He ain't got no power nothin' but he got what it takes
He's got Gracie's arm around him and a smile on his face
He's got the power of love

No air condition'...no cellular telephone
He goes rumblin' down the highway listenin' to his A.M. radio
With one arm out the window and a smile on his face
Makes you wonder how he got there 'til you see him look at Grace...

No power windows...got no power brakes..
He ain't got no power nothin' but he got what it takes...
One arm out the window and a smile upon his face...
It makes you wonder how he got there until you see him look at Grace...
See him look at grace

He got the power... ain't that the power of love
He's got the power...ain't that the power of love
He's got the power...ain't that the power of love
He's got the power...ain't that the...he got no
Power windows...got no power brakes
He ain't got no power nothing but he got what it takes...
Power of love...the power of love...he got the power...the power of love
