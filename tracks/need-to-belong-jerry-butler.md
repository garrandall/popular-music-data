Wo oh oh oh (need to belong) yeah, (to someone)
M hm hm hm (need to belong)hm hm hm hm hm (to someone)

I need to belong to someone
It hurts to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world, 'cause
I need to belong to someone (m hm hm hm hm hm hm)

I wanna be kissed and held tight
Want to be missed on a cold lonely night
Somebody hear my plea and call out to me, 'cause
I need to belong to someone

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
No one cares for me, I've never known sympathy
I hide my needs from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man and a man
(needs to belong) yes he does (to someone)
A man hates to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl, bring love into my world, because
I need to belong to someone

Oh, I hide my needs, from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man, and a man needs (needs to belong)
To belong, (to someone) to someone
A man hates to be known, as no one
Oh send me a girl, to bring love into my world, 'cause
I need to belong to someone (need to belong) mm (to someone)

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
(need to belong to someone)
Well I wanna belong (need to belong) to somebody (to someone)
Just like you (fade) (need to belong)
Someone I can tell (to someone)
My troubles to
