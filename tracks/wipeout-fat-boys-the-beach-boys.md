Heheheheheheee Wipe out

Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Hey watch out
Here we go here go
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out

For three years straight we toured the nation
When we get through we needed a vacation
We wanted to party and get a little rest
So we packed our things and headed out west
We got our surfboards took the beach ball out
Jumped in a limousine ready to wipe out

Now we're ready to go
Here we go here we go
One one two one two one two hit it D
Here we go

We got to California I said headed for the beach
There were girls galore all within our reach
There was sand and sun and lots of fun
But when we get there the fun really begun
So we cut on the box and started to shout
It was the Beach Boys rocking huh huh the "Wipe Out"

Oo oo
Ooo ooo
Oo
Oo
Oo oo

Wa-ah-ah-ah wawawa-ooh-oo
Wa-ah-ah-ah wawawa-ooh-oo
That's it, that that that's it dit dit dit dit dit
Hit it D

The sun went down and the night began
We was rapping for the people cold chilling bopping
We was partying hard making lots of noise
When around the corner came the real Beach Boys
So we all jumped up and started to shout
"Let's all sing the song called the 'Wipeout'"

Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Hey watch out
Here we go here go
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out

Stay go stay go stay go
Bring it out now

Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
Wiping out wipe out
Hey watch out
Here we go here go
Wah wah wah
Wiping out wipe out
