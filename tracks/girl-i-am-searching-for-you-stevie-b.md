Tell me why
It always has to end
It seems the loving is over
Before it ever begins

It happens every time
My heart gets in the way
And now you're blowing my mind
I just can't find my way, lady

And if you see me cryin'
Just touch my hand, don't pass me by
'Cause girl, I am tryin'
To find you, I need you, lady

'Cause girl, I am searching for you
And will you help me find my way
And girl, I am searching for you
And will you kindly show your face

Girl, I am searching for you
My heart is cryin' more and more
You know what I'm searching for
A love that will last, last forever more

Please tell me why
It has to take so long
To find a special lover
With a heart made of gold

You know I need you now

I just can't take anymore
You touched my lonely heart, girl
You know that you got the cure, lady

And if you see me cryin'
Just touch my hand, don't pass me by
'Cause girl, I am tryin'
To find you, I need you, lady

And if you see me cryin'
Just touch my hand, don't pass me by
'Cause girl, I am tryin'
To find you, I need you, lady

Girl, I am searching for you
Will you help me find my way
Girl, I am searching for you
And will you kindly show your face

Girl, I am searching for you
My heart is cryin' more and more
You know what I'm searching for
A love that will last, last forever more

Girl, I am searching for you (Hey)
Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for you

Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for your love
