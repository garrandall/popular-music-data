Why'd you call me today with nothing new to say?
You pretend it's just hello, but you know what it does to me to see your number on the phone.
Now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me? 
Are you tryin' to bring back the tears or just the memories?
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been. 
When we hang up it's almost like I'm losing you again.
Can't you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?

I get so tired of living like this.
I don't have the time, neither do my friends, 
To stay up at night, to pull me through,
And to find the things to keep my mind off of you.

So, now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?
Did you call to say you've found someone and I'm a used- to- be.
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been. 
If you've moved on why does it feel like I'm losing you again?
Can't you see? So what do you want? What do you want from me?

What do you want me to say?
That I'm content? That I'm on the fence? That I wish you would've stayed?
Oh baby what do you want, what do you want, what do you want from me?
To come here and make love tonight cause you're feelin' lonely.
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been.
When we wake up and say goodbye it's like I'm losing you again. 
Can't you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?
What do you want, what do you want from me?
