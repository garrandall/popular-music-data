Express Yourself!

Express Yourself!

You don't ever need help from nobody else. All you got to do now:

Express Yourself!

What ever you do, do it good

What ever you do, do it good. All right...

It's not what you look like, when you're doin' what you're doin'

It's what you're doin' when you're doin' what you look like you're doin'!

Express Yourself!

Express Yourself!

They're doin'it on the moon, yeah...

In the jungle too

Everybody on the floor, now

Jumpin' like a kangaroo

So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...

Some people have everything, and other people don't

But everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want

Express Yourself!

Express Yourself!

O, do it! O, do it

Do it to it. Go on and do it

Yo, do it. Give

Express Yourself!

Express Yourself
