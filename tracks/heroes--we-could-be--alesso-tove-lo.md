We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the Sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run


Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything


We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be


Anybody’s got the power
They don't see it ‘cause they don't understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me, we got the World in our hands


Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything


We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be


We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be


All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light


We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be
