I won't love you anymore (sorry)
I won't love you anymore (sorry)

Sorry
I'm sorry

You made me think I loved you so
The tricks you used were awfully low
I think now I see that you're over me
Our love is a lie, hope you understand why

I won't love you anymore (sorry)
I won't love you anymore (sorry)
And now I say I'm leaving today
Don't know where I'll go I just know I can't stay

Sorry
I'm sorry

I thought the touch of your caress
Showed me your loving tenderness
But you'll give the world to every girl
Who gives you a sigh or who catches your eye

I won't love you anymore (sorry)
I won't love you anymore (sorry)
Don't be said that I've left, it's all for the best
I'm saying what I know you've already guessed

I won't love you anymore...
