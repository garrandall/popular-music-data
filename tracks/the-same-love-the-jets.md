You and me
We had a love that was forever
That's what I thought

And I can still remember
Words you said
You said we'd always be together
Then why am I alone tonight?

Something changed now
You just don't feel the same
I'll never understand


How can the same love
That made me so happy
Make me so sad?
I don't understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughing
Cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all


Remembering the nights
We held onto each other
The times you told me
You'll never love another

Remembering when I was
All you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?


Summer days have left me
Standing in the rain
Somebody tell me how

Was my heart so blind
I couldnâ€™t see?
Was I a fool to believe
Promises you made to me
What went wrong?
What went wrong?



It doesn't seem right at all
