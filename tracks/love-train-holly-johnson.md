You're a work of art, you're the Trevi Fountain
You're a golden heart, you're the highest mountain
You bring me flowers every day of my life
You save me from the worry and the strife
Take me in your arms

Baby, baby I'm on a winning streak
When I met you I reached my peak
Your perfect view makes me feel brand new, yeah
Well, you're just right to keep me up all night, up all night

Working all the time to make you mine, all mine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train

You make time stand still, your children's laughter
Love's overspill, I'll come running after
You bring the spring right through my door
You're everything that's worth living for
Thrill me with your charms

Baby, baby, my knees are weak
I need you now, don't play hide and seek
No times long enough, leaving you is tough
You're just right to keep me up all night, up all night

Working all the time to make you mine, all mine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train

Keep the flames burning, let your spirit fly
Stay on the right track, baby, till the day I die
Keep the coal coming

Baby, baby, I'm on a winning streak
When I met you, I reached my peak
Your perfect view makes me feel brand new, yeah
And you're just right to keep me up all night, up all night

Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah
Stroke it up, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah

Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah

Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine, yeah
Riding the love train, stroke it up, riding the love train
