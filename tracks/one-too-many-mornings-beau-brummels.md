Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-fallin'
All the dogs will lose their bark
And the silent madness shatters
From the sounds inside my mind

And I know there one too many mornings
One too many mornings, yes sir
One too many mornings
Since you're gone
Since you're gone

Now come the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have stayed
Yes and I gaze back to the street
On the sidewalk and the sign

And I know there is one too many mornings
One too many mornings, yes sir
One too many mornings
Since you're gone
Since you're gone

Now it's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
Yes, when ev'rything that I'm saying
You can say it just as good
Well, you're right from your side
Yes, but I'm right from mine

Yes we know there's one too many mornings
One too many mornings, ah
One too many mornings
Since you're gone
Hey, since you're gone

We often talk about one too many mornings, ya
One too many mornings, c'mon now
One too many mornings
Since you're gone
Since you're goooooone...
