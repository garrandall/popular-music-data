I wish I had all you ever wanted
I'd give it right to you
But I don't have it
How could I ever find it
The strength to let you go?
'Cause I don't have it when will I have it?
And it goes
And it goes on
And it goes on
You won't see me cry
You know I decided
That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it
I'm gonna have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
I've got no choice but to face it
I have to let you know that I don't like it
My love is good for someone
And it may take some time
But I will find him
Why should I waste it?
When I go
When I go
When I go on
I will go on
You won't see me cry
You know I decided
That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it, oh no
Even if I have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me
I finally decided
And I found the way to fight it
So you won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
