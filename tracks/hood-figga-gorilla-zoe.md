All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Shorty you can hate but your bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told your girl you rap, but your CD floppin'
You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Your girl is persistant, she ain't stoppin'

Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin' ya'll know we run the town (hood nigga)
And I Keep A Bad Chick Around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (hood nigga)
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flat's look like flapjacks, pancakes, you ain't know (hood nigga)
I'ma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap stuff is easy, every beat I get I murder

Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin' ya'll know we run the town (hood nigga)
And I keep a bad chick around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (hood nigga)
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flat's look like flapjacks, pancakes, you ain't know (hood nigga)
I'ma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk

Get like you, naw, get like me
Eveesus we don't rock white tees
Classic Capris, but Knicks on the feet
Camo bathing apes, 10 pair every week
Menage 3, the girls suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the beat
I see you, naw you see me
You'll see I see you fuckin' with me

Watchin' out for gold diggers like Kanye
But I will play Beyonce, or Ashanti
Make Keyshia Cole say she shoulda cheated if she ever come my way
Get some head from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' out magic city every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it that's what I say
You say? I say and what I say goes

All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but your bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
