Whooo umm yeah

Life is like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Oh, yeah

There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Come on. Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
