When I come through your town
Whoâs gonna clown
Proof from the sound and the boots on the ground
You shooting from the moon I'm bringing Jupiter down
You always blow smoke like a hoop go âround
Slow poke while running at a fast pace
Thatâs why you standing there last place
Iâm harder than a nipple when it lactates
You never reach 3rd base thatâs why we always giving you the catch face
See I'm made here, TIA, got African blood,
Itâs in my DNA
These rappers acting like a lead in a play
Never know who they gonna be today
I pray to God... No, not the paper
In my Chevrolet Iâm bumping Doc Doc Shebeleza
Vacation in Turks and Caicos
Stay sharp with the church of the play close
Party rockin about a whole damn party shot shopping
Like a body shop, better get laid though
Whaddup Durban
Whaddup Cape Town
Man, I love SA bro
Johannesburg holding me down
Newtown, Pimville and Soweto
Stay faithful live by the code
Or catch a face full of fists to the nose
All alone like a dog when he burying a bone
Cry to your mom better hurry on home
Bitch nigga I do this
This music for the movement
Helping you to cut through the confusion
Cassper said hop on the remix
Itâs nothing show me where the booth is


Shebeleza
Do Doc Shebeleza
In my 325 like Iâm Doc Doc Shebeleza


Man, can you believe it?
I drop a track on some free shit turn rappers paraplegic
Shout out to C-Sick
I heard these haters are preaching
Tell âem to suck on my penis
Should I repeat it?
Tell âem to suck on my penis
I got a hit every season
I will remain undefeated
Shout out to Tata Madiba
Iâm ouchea abusing the freedom
High as the ceiling
Why should I mention the features?
Itâs already clear that I already beat âem
Back to Refiloe
Theyâre singing my songs in Zimbabwe
Iâm Reppinâ the nordie,
Mafikeng Ga ke le sile
200k every weekend
I cannot explain the feeling
Me and Talib on the remix
Me and Talib on the remix
Man, I got some demons I am addicted to females
I fuck âem for no fucking reason
I say it fucking believe it
Berries Vanillas and Peaches
Berries Vanillas and Peaches
Still trying to give
Boitumelo a baby and no one can stop me
My album is about to go Gold
I heard you sold 200 copies
Maaaaan, this is what they be hating
Mama Yvonne Chaka Chaka said this her favourite song
Start dogging everyday mara swaak swaak mabebeza
I wake up everyday feeling like Doc Doc Shebeleza



Still winning 


If you feel like hake o nxanywe Gana ka wena
Jozi ele busy ntsi ntsi ntsi Spana ka wena
Remember when we started Kgale bare bare bana ba tsenwa
Now Iâm having silly WhatsApp conversations with girls like Babalwa Mneno (uhuuu)
