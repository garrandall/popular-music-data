Feelin'


There's a party going on
I can feel it coming on
There's a party going on right here
Everybody start's to move
Get up on the groove
There's a party going on right here
So everybody (here)
Let's just walk it all nite
Come on and bring the party right
Make it right
So Mr.DJ put the rhythm to the groove
Make the body move, move all nite


There's a party going on
I can feel it coming on
There's a party going on right here
Everybody start's to move
Get up on the groove
There's a party going on right here
Right hereeeeeeeeee here
There's a party going on
I can feel it coming on
There's a party going on right here
When the music start's to flow
And your body start's to go
All the party, it's time to chill
So everybody (here) just go?
Dance, the music put you in a trance
With the rhythm, so mr dj
Let? to the clock, let walk out to
That door, I wanna feel it
