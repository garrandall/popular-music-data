(ah) Oh I love you the way-a-ay you are
(ah) Oh I love you the way-ay you are

Always be faithful to me
And near each tonight to hold so tight
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are (I love you the way you are)

Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Never lose the charms you possess
You-our loveliness, the way you caress
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are (I love you the way you are)

Don't have to change your color of hair
The clothes you wear may all become you so
And don't listen to what friends may say
I will love you till my dy-y-y-in' day

Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You're my girl, you ought to know
The way-ay we kiss, I'm all aglow
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are (I love you the way you are)

Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You're my girl, you ought to know
The way we kiss, I'm all aglow
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you (are)
Oh, I love you the wa-a-ay you are
(Oh) Oh, I love you the wa-ay you are
