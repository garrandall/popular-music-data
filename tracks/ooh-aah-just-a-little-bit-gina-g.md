You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love


Am I wrong? Am I so unkind
Show me the way
Don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment, I'm just thinking of you


(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore


Feeling good let's go all the way
It's got to be set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go


How can I prove my love to you
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true


(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore


What can you do for me
Oh what can you do
'Cause I feel, so alive
I feel your love inside ohhhh


(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore


Just a little bit
A little bit more
Just a little bit
A little bit more
Just a little bit
A little bit more
