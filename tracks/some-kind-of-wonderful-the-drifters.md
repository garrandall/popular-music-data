Wonderful wonderful

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me

There's some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful

Some kind of sweet lips
Some kind of warm eyes
Some kind of soft sigh
There's only some kind of wonderful

Oh yeah wonderful
