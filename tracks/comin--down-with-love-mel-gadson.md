Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum, dum)

(Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum, dum)

Well, it ain't the measles
And it ain't the flu
Just a little old virus
Tagged Y-O-U

Ah-Ah, I'm comin' down
(Down, down)
Comin' down with love

(Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum)
(Down, de-dum, de-dum, dum)

Well, all I did was kiss you
Kiss you once or twice
Ooo, my lips are like fire
And my hands are like ice

Ah-Ah, I'm comin' down
(Down, down)
Comin' down with love

Angels are flyin'
I'm stickin' fast
If this is dyin'
Who wants to last?

Now, don't you call-a no doctor
Don't you call-a no nurse
I don't wanna get better
I just wanna get worse

Ah-Ah, I'm comin' down
(Down, down)
Comin' down with love

Angels are flyin'
I'm stickin' fast
If this is dyin'
Who wants to last?

Now, don't you call-a no doctor
Don't you call-a no nurse
I don't wanna get better
I just wanna get worse

I'm comin' down, down, down
Comin' down with love
(Down, down, down)
Comin' down with love
(Down, down, down)
Comin' down with love
(Down, down, down)
Comin' down with love
