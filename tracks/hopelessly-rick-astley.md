I walk the wire every night
I can't decide between wrong and right
I've lost control over the things i do
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who never took a chance
Becomes a victim of circumstance
I've lost my way, now I'm so confused
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

All my dreams are far behind me
They don't matter anymore
I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

Now the one who always played it safe
Becomes another who's lost his way
I can't believe it, though I know it's true
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

And all my dreams begin to blind me
And I was so confused
And I don't care about the things I could lose
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you

I'm not gonna fight it, I'm gonna choose
To hopelessly fall, oh yeah
You know I'll hopelessly fall in love, with you.
