No use pretending things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

At first we thought that love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right
But like the sun we watched it fade away
From morning into lonely night

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
