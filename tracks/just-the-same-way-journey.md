Yesterday was a good day
It's after midnight and I've got you on my mind
Come with me never go away
Every day we will fly, yeah


That's the same way you love me. (That's the same way she loves you)
Ooo, just the same way you do. (Just the same way you do)
Just the same way you love me. (Just the same way she)
Loves


Take a chance now the timing's right
You're free to leave the key to my life
Stay with me
Won't you stay the night
In the morning feeling fine, yeah




Oh, no, you should be holding on to him girl
Oh, yeah just like, just like you want to do
Oh, no, just love and squeeze him girl
Oh, yeah just love and squeeze him yeah
