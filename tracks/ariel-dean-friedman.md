Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl
She sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria

Standing by the waterfall in Paramus Park
She was working for the friends of BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup
She was looking for change
And so was I

She was a Jewish girl
I fell in love with her
She wrote her number on the back of my hand
I called her up
I was all out of breath
I said
"Come hear me play in my rock and roll band"

I took a shower
And I put on my best blue jeans
I picked her up in my new VW van
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath
I said "Hi"
She said, "Yeah, I guess I am"


Ariel
Ariel


We had a little time
We were real hungry
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat
She had some onion rings
She had a pickle
She forgot to tell me how she didn't eat meat

I had a gig in the American Legion hall
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps
She was sitting in a corner against the wall
She would smile
And I melted all over the floor


Ariel
Ariel


I took her home with me
We watched some TV
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady
I started fooling around with the verticle
We got the munchies
So I made some spaghetti

We sat and we talked into the night
While channel two was signing off the air
I found the softness of a mouth
We made love
The bombs bursting in air
Ariel


Ariel
Ariel

Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl
She sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
