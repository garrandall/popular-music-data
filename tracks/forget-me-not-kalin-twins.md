Forget me not
Kalin Twins

Forget the fellows that you knew before
You ain't a gonna see them anymore
Forget the trip that you were gonna take
Forget it all, but for goodness sake
Forget me not
Forget me not
You're all I got
Forget me not

Forget the dating ev'ry Friday night
I ain't a gonna let you out of sight
I'm going out and buy a wedding ring
So you can start forgetting ev'ry thing
Forget me not
Forget me not
You're all I got
Forget me not

Forget the fellows at the candy store
Cause you ain't a gonna see them anymore
Forget the talking on the telephone
Tell your ma to tell them you're not home
Forget me not
Forget me not
You're all I got
Forget me not

Forget the way you roll them big blue eyes
At all those big and handsome foot-ball guys
Forget the meeting all the gang at three
From now on you're walking home with me
Forget me not
Forget me not
You're all I got
Forget me not
