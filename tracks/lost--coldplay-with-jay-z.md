Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the firing's stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off


Yeah
...just waitin' til the... the... yeah
Aha, I got you, uh
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even a half what they might do
Don't believe me? Ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take
They remind you, you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?
Because I'm...


Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
