When you complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough

Girl, I want to provide for you
And do all the things that you want me to, but

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
I'm beggin' you, darlin'
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down

Sacrifices I will make
I'm ready to give as well as take
One thing I need is your respect
One thing I can't take is your neglect

More than anything, I need your love
Then troubles are easy to rise above

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down

You complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough

Girl, I want to provide for you
Do all the things that you want me to, but

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm beggin'
Oh no!
Don't bring me down

Oh no, no
Baby, please!
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
I need your tender lovin'
So please, don't bring me down

Oh, baby, baby, baby, don't hurt me
Don't bring me down
Oh no, please don't hurt me
