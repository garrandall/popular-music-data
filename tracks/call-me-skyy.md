Rich rich rich
Yo
Bitch bitch
GABBY!
Muah!

I don't fuck up here we're so motherfucking rich
Step up this gang, we're still running this shit
I remember those days when we didn't have a shit
Now we're on top shinning on your niggas is sick

Playgirl gang bitch yeah, we're really rich shit
Rollie polie ollie put the ice upon my wrist
Come and get your bitch, she all on my dick
I don't have to touch it, little bitch I send a hit

Drop out the spot and I came to hit a lick
I ain't never had a shit so I whip my wrist bitch
Rollin'with the blood they might bust some crips
Niggas pull up with the lean I might take some sips
And I with the gang so bitches taking pics
I was 15 on the lick I came from trapping shit
And I'm on your block and I got the stick
Imma pull up with the choppa empty out the clip

I don't care 'bout your blue gray
Your nigga be weak, your nigga fee
So much rifle filled up and spilled
That nigga on drugs, he stays off the booze
Damn he is gross, he is a hoochie
You know we call toast
Filled his ass don't get too close
I gotta dip yeah I gotta go
Smoking that green to clear my nose
Uber your bitch on the way to my show
She wanna fuck with gang that girls a hoe
She don't want a newbie she want a pro

I don't fuck up here we're so motherfucking rich
Step up this gang, we're still running this shit
I remember those days when we didn't have a shit
Now we're on top shinning on your niggas is sick

Playgirl gang bitch yeah, we're really rich shit
Rollie polie olie put the ice upon my wrist
Come and get your bitch, she all on my dick
I don't have to touch it, little bitch I send a hit
Pulled up to the spot like where you at
Bitch really pussy change your name cat
Promise I won't fight your bitch I got the mat
Screaming out the window bitch I got your back
Giggle giggle I plug you like a fiddle I pop you like a sicke

Yeah girl this ain't no riddle
Did this shit since I was little
Shake that ass wiggle wiggle
Got the Gucci as my pic shake my hair like I am willow
