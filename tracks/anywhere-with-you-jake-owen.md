If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer
Sittin' back in the holler on a country road
Well, then, baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't want to settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby, I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

I bet there's a two-lane
Runnin' right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We can send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in, anytime, baby, you say when

I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby, I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby, I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, well girl, I swear
Just say the word, I'll take you there
Aww anywhere, anywhere with you

Yeah, I'll go anywhere with you
