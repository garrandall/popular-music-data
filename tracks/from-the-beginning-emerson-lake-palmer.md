There might have been things I missed 
But don't be unkind 
It don't mean I'm blind 
Perhaps there's a thing or two 

I think of lying in bed 
I shouldn't have said 
But there it is 

You see it's all clear 
You were meant to be here 
From the beginning 

Maybe I might have changed 
And not been so cruel 
Not been such a fool 
Whatever was done is done 
I just can't recall 
It doesn't matter at all 

You see it's all clear 
You were meant to be here 
From the beginning
