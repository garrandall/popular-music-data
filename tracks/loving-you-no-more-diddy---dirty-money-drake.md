So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
when you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more,


Loving you no more,
I just I can't I just canât be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,


Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly,
so many lonely sleepless nights,
I'm going through hell to convince you love me,
but never her approval no matter how I try,
the way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
momma always told me to respect the woman,
but what am I to do when her parents do not try,

So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing Iâm afraid to say,
oooooohhh



Iâve been so dependent on your love for so long,
punishment for me is trying to let go,
give it from your heart is what you taught me,
addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now it's changed
My life ain't the same as you are
heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
if I canât have what mean most to me,

So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing Iâm afraid to say,




Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause Iâve drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And thereâs pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thatâs sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youâre suspicious Iâm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thatâs the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what Iâm gone do
Since everything Iâm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one Iâm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure


So selfishly, You can only show feelings when yours feel you're in jeopardy
Time has changed and i'm no longer willing
Do you see how my hearts is bleeding?
