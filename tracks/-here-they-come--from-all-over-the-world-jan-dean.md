They're comin' from all over the word

Hey, everybody, see 'em arrivin'
The greatest stars you'll ever see
Some are flyin' and some are drivin'
From Liverpool to Tennessee

Chuck Berry's checkin' in from St. Lou
He's gonna sing "Maybellene" and "Memphis" too
The representative from New York City
Is Lesley Gore, now, she sure looks pretty

Here they come from all over the world
Here they come from all over the world
You know the guitar's groovin' so keep it movin'
And come on, come on, come on
They're comin' from all over the world

Can't you just hear everybody singin'
The biggest sound you've ever heard
A-clappin' and a-stompin' while the guitar's screamin'
You better go spread the word

Don't forget the Motor City sounds of the day
The Baby Love-in' Supremes and Marvin Gaye
The king of the blues, soulful James Brown
The Beach Boys singin', now, "I Get Around"
Yeah, get around, round, round, I get around

Here they come from all over the world
Here they come from all over the world
You know the guitar's groovin' so keep it all movin'
And come on, come on, come on
They're comin' from all over the world

Those bad-lookin' guys with the moppy long hair
The Rolling Stones from Liverpool are bound to be there
Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J., too
They're all gonna be here to sing for you

Here they come from all over the world
Here they come from all over the world
You know the guitar's groovin' so keep it all movin'
And come on, come on, come on

From all over the world, from all over the world
From all over the world, from all over the world
From all over the world, from all over the world
