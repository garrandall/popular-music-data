There's a new dance going around
They call the 81 (81)
Everybody's doing it whether
They are old or young (old or young)

Because they're tired
Of doing the monkey (monkey)
Tired of doing the swim
So if you want to have some fun
Come on and dance, dance, dance


Do the 81 (do the 81)
Cause it's so fine (it's so fine)
In a big boss line (in a big boss line)
Do it one more time (do it one more time)

My momma said she's gonna buy herself
Some dancing shoes (dancing shoes)
And all you need is to feel the beat
Get with the groove (with the groove)

Well, it's better
Than the cha cha (cha cha)
Better than the swim
Everybody come join in
And dance, dance, dance



I know you're tired of
Doing the monkey (monkey)
Tired of doing the swim
So come along and join the fun
And dance, dance, dance



Cause it's so fine (do the 81)
In a big boss line
(In a big boss line)
