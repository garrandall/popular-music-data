Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd like to tell you something
All about the good and the bad
I wish today the world, my friends
Would stop being sad
There's so much evil round us
I feel that I could die
And I know, yeah
That I was born to cry
Well, if I ever told you
All about the things I have done
I can't remember having
Even one day of fun
I don't know what I'm doing
If I do, it's a lie
But I know that I
Was born to cry
Yeah, cry
I said cry, oh, yeah, cry
Oh, yeah, oh
Well, every girl I ever loved
Always stepped right on my feet
I thought I had a friend once
But he kicked out my teeth
The things I like and wanna have
I can't even buy
But I know, yeah
That I was born to cry
Well, I know someday
And maybe soon
That master will call
And when he does
I'll you something
Ha ha, I won't cry at all
Until it happens, folks
I'll sail with that tide
And I know, yeah
That I was born to cry
Well, I said cry, oh, yeah
Cry, oh, yeah, cry
I said don't you know
That I was born to cry
Well, I cry, cry, cry, cry
Yeah, well, I know
Someday and maybe soon
That master will call
And when he does
I'll you something
I won't cry at all
Until it happens, folks
I guess I'll sail with the tide
And I know that I was born to cry
