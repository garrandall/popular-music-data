I've got to see you, somehow
Not tomorrow, right now
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
Oh, steal away

Now, don't start thinking, tryin' to make up your mind
Your folks are sleeping, let's not waste any time
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
Oh, steal away

I know it's wrong asking this of you
There's no other way I can be with you
If only your folks would approve
Seeing like this we wouldn't have to do

No, I won't tell anybody else
I'll keep it to myself
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please, steal away

I know it's wrong asking this of you
But there's no other way
I can be with you
If only your folks
If only you would approve
Seeing like this we wouldn't have to do

I wanna keep it
Keep it to myself
I can't keep it
I can't keep it away from myself


So come on
Come on and steal away
Yeah!
