I walked down this ol' lonely street
And no one seems to wanna speak
Oh Who Cares, who cares for me?

All the world seems cold
The world seems grey
Nothing seems the same since you went away
Who cares, who cares for me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Why can't I be set free?

All I want is you
All I know is you
But somehow our love just can't be
Who cares, who cares for me
