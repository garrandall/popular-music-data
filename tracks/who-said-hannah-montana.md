I'm more than just
Your average girl
I'd like to turn me up
And show the world
Aw, yea
'Cuz some can talk the talk
But this girl just wants to rock
I'm individual
I'm not like anyone
I can be glamorous
Just like you see in all the magazines
I can be cool as ice
Or anything I wanna be
Who said, who said
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say
That I know I can
Who said, who said
I won't be President?
I say, I say
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Aw yea, yea!
Go on and make some noise
Every girl has her choice
To lead their own parade
I do it my way
Oww!
I can be soft and sweet
Or louder than the radio
I can be sophisticated
Or totally go
Out of control
Who said, who said
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say
That I know I can
Who said, who said
I'm not electrifying?
I say, I say
There's no holding back
Stayin' right on track
'Cuz you control the game
So let? em know your name
No limitations on imagination
Imaginate!
Yea!
Who said, who said
I can't be worldwide?
I say, I say
Time is on my side
Who said, who said
I can't be 10 feet tall?
I say, I say
That I can have it all
Who said, who said
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say
That I know I can
Who said, who said
I won't be president?
I say, I say
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Whoa, yea
Who said?
Come on, yea
That's right!
