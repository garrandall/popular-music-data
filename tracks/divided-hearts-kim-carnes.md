You're looking through your window
Into the neon light
You try to forget him
But the feeling keeps you up all night
Flashback, flashback, flashback
Only come from an abstract mind

I look back
I see you in your frame
I only wish I could climb through
But the wall around it stops me all the same
Flashback, flashback
Only come from an abstract mind

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
And we are left with our divided hearts, oh

A standing conversation
Down at the Pink CafÃ©
You tellin' me you got reason
But I just can't hear a single word you say
Flashback, flashback
Only color the abstract mind

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
The chance we take
And we are left with our divided hearts, oh

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
And we are left
With our divided hearts

(One divided heart) oh, oh
(Two divided hearts)
And we are left
With our divided hearts
Our divided hearts

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
And we are left
With our divided hearts

(One divided heart)
(Two divided hearts)
