Isn't it strange, that you used to know me
All the highs and lows and in betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird, that you've seen me naked
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay

And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers, yeah

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk

Isn't it wild, that I know your weakness
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't awkward, I got a new somebody
And honestly it'll probably be while
Before we can just be friends

I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

(Small talk)

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk

Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

And I just can't believe we went from strangers to lovers to strangers

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk

Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
