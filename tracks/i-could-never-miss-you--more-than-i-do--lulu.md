Finders not keepers, and all that's left is just reminders,
Love in pieces, the debris and the dust of memories,
That linger so long, the heartaches that keep hanging on,
Just wondering where it all went wrong and whether I can start anew,
Oh but I could never miss you more than I do,

Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,
Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,

Beggers can't be choosers, and I've had my share of backing nothing,
But losers, but if I searched the whole world over, from pillar to post,
Your the one that I need the most, if I combed this land from coast to
Coast who would take the place of you,
Cause I could never miss you more than I do.

Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,
Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,

I couldn't love you any better, I couldn't love you any more, cause I
Spend each and every second each and every hour hoping you'll be at my door.

Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,
Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,
Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do,
Loving you like this oh I could never miss you more than I do.
