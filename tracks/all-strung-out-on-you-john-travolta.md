I just can't get enough of you, baby
There just ain't enough of you to go around
And just when I'm needing you, baby
You ain't nowhere to be found
Baby, it's getting' me down, because I'm...

All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
Oh, baby-baby, why can't you love me
Baby-baby be thinkin' of me
Baby-baby I'm all strung out on you

It hurts when you needle me, baby
But I'd rather have the pain then lose your love
I know you're no good for me, baby
But I'll keep trippin' around
Trackin' you all over town, because I'm...

I love you
Just the way you are
Like a little fallen star
I'm gonna catch you someday
(Gonna catch you someday)
And you'll never get away
(Never get away), because I'm...

I'm all strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby

(Baby, I'm all strung out)
(All strung out)
(All strung out)
(All strung out)
