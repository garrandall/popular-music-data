(CHORUS)
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Tell the Devil he's a liar
Come and save the likes of me

Some men walk on the water
Everybody looking on
I didn't know I was his
Daughter, daughter, daughter
Til both of us have come and gone

(CHORUS)

If you see me in some dark alley
Looking like I don't belong
Lord, you can put me in the green valley
I'll be singing the same old song

(CHORUS) 3X
