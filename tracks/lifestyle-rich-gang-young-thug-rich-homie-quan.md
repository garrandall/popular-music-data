She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
If she ain't like the reservoir, I swear that ho won't go
She ain't do the less, boy, I swear she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't from Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
I swear she do the most, the most, the most, the most, the most she do the most

Shawty got a bad attitude, but I ain't mad at her
Fat ass, lookin' like she knew I took a grab at it
Scream ass, runnin' through the school, took a stab at 'em
Mighty food bad for me, college school classin'
All this Louis V, I feel like comin' to America
With being 'bout we ain't even rich, frosted like we cereal
Talk loud, I ain't hearin' ya, these niggas delirious
That's a Lamborghini, no Ford, but I know George and I'm curious
Curiosity killed the cat, I heard that
I couple of bags, a couple of packs, I served that
And If I said it, I can't take my word back
From east Atlanta all the way to old nat


She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
If she ain't like the reservoir, I swear that ho won't go
She ain't do the less, boy, I swear she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't from Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
I swear she do the most, the most, the most, the most, the most she do the most

How does it feel to make a mil
When you ain't even signed yet?
I'm sittin' here like fuck a deal
Cause it ain't even crossed my mind yet
I know that I gotta feed my family
No matter the circumstances you gotta keep them happy, yeah
When the money gone, who there?, aye
When the money gone, who cares?, aye, nobody
She sweat 


She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
If she ain't like the reservoir, I swear that ho won't go
She ain't do the less, boy, I swear she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't from Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
I swear she do the most, the most, the most, the most, the most she do the most


Left me chillin'
I left a girl from Philly, because she gave me no ceilings
I kept the girl chilly, because she game me no feelings
She left me none, but I cheated, so it's no dealings
Now when she be me, I know she say she wanna kill 'em
She say I left holes in the heart, she couldn't heal 'em
Man, I fucked all of her friends that ain't friends she wanna kill 'em
But it's only her fault, cause when we fucked, she used to tell 'em
Especially this one bad bitch named Mia
See, I was sex limited, fuckin' was like a million
And I ain't gon' lie, I liked it when she told me
But she should've told her, cause she was like Wendy Williams
Tell 'em all come go get it, nigga
I shoot up the city, nigga
Swear the god I'mma killin', nigga
Killin' nigga, catch a case just like you pealin', nigga
I go up, up and away
She, she gotta capture my spot, she won't stay
She come and throw that pussy just like paint
I owe that bitch for everyday
I owe that bitch for everyday
I swear to god she ain't gon' stay
My house bitch ain't got no name
I'm the blooded opposite of her neighbor


She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
If she ain't like the reservoir, I swear that ho won't go
She ain't do the less, boy, I swear she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't from Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
I swear she do the most, the most, the most, the most, the most she do the most

I swear she got my attention
Besides a difference from bitches, she keep a vision on digits
She got no kils on a nigga and I love that shit the most
She ain't really like that Bentley though
So I bought that ho a ghost
No matter the celebration livin' life
We gon' toast to this lifestyle we livin'
These niggas they can't feel
These niggas wanna be it, but can't
Rich Homie times Rich Gang
They envy my pimpin', I wear a tux, I wear skinnys
I don't like cause she timid, she ride that pipe like a Willy
Four Willy, dirt bike, hit the clutch, baby
A cold killa at night don't give a fuck, baby
Try your luck baby, ice is cold
Get some Kleenex, nigga wipe your nose
Cause it's runnin' like you did when twelve came
Talkin' to them pigs, don't mention my name
I know how it go, I been in the game
Lil shawty do the most, boy, that shit is same
This time I change on the hat
Throw that flame on 'em
Drop top, bang on 'em
Spit it from the heart, give 'em pain, homie
Rather stop at Walmart, I don't shop at Target, I might aim on 'em
Two condos in Georgia with my name on it
