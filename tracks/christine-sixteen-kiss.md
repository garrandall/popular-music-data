She's got me dizzy, she sees me through to the end
She's got me in her hands and there's no use in pretending

Christine sixteen, Christine sixteen

She drives me crazy, I want to give her all I've got
And she's hot every day and night, there is no doubt about it

Christine sixteen, Christine sixteen

"I don't usually say things like this to girls your age, but when I saw you
coming out of the school that day, that day I knew, I knew, I've got to have
you, I've got to have you."

She's' been around, but she's young and clean
I've got to have her, can't live without her, whoo no
Christine sixteen, Christine sixteen
