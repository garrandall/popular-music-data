I will build you a castle with a tower so high
It reaches the moon
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly
And compose you a tune
I'll give you lovin' warm as Mama's oven
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will love with your hand in my hand
You'll be queen of the stars
And every day we can play on the Milky Way
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea
To wear in your hair
I'll do anything and everything to keep you happy
To show you that I care
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I'll take the stars and count 'em and move a mountain
And if that don't do I'll try something new
I'll tell the moon above it's you that I love
If it don't do I'll try something new
