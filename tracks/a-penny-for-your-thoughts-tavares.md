(Penny for your thoughts)

I've got to know where I stand
I just got to know where I am with you

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Walking, holding hands, you say you're mine, all mine
Then soon another face steals your eyes away
It's just a guessing game, and I can't help feeling used
Love shouldn't be so darn confused

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

People love to talk, they say you're using me
Though face to face you swear I'm the only one
If I had a crystal ball, I would gaze into your mind
I'd see what you were thinking, if our ship was sinking
If you're leaving me behind

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

Girl, if I had a crystal ball (a crystal ball)
I would gaze into your mind
I'd see what you were thinking
If our ship was sinking
If you're leaving me behind

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (hey, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me (tell me you love me)
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (Oh, your thoughts, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (Oh, a kiss, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts , a nickel for a kiss
(Just me) (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Penny for your thoughts (Just your thoughts), a nickel for a kiss (And a kiss, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me (Tell me you love me)
Penny for your thoughts , a nickel for a kiss
(Oh, yeah) (Yeah, yeah)

Penny for your thoughts (Oh, baby), a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
