(Oh woo hoo hoo)
I'm a good guy for a gal
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
So won't you look my palm over?
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
I got time for a chat
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
So won't you tell me my future?


(Oh woo hoo hoo)
I'm gonna break down at 50
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm not quite a stallion
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
I'm a good guy for a gal
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm mentally slippin'


Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
Friends of P
Friends of P
We're friends of P
Friends


(Oh woo hoo hoo)
Some modest fame and fortune
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
Is gonna come to me early
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
I get two loves in my life
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm dying at 90


Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
Friends of P
Friends of P
Friends of P
Friends of P



(Oh woo hoo hoo)
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
(Oh woo hoo hoo)
(Oh woo hoo hoo)


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
