(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
I'm a good guy for a gal
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
So won't you look my palm over?
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
I got time for a chat
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
So won't you tell me my future?


(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
I'm gonna break down at 50
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm not quite a stallion
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
I'm a good guy for a gal
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm mentally slippin'


Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
Friends of P
Friends of P
We're friends of P
Friends


(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
Some modest fame and fortune
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
Is gonna come to me early
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
I get two loves in my life
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
And I'm dying at 90


Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
Friends of P
Friends of P
Friends of P
Friends of P



(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)
(Ooh woo hoo hoo)


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me


If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
