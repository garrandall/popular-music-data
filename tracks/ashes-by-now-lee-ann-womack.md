This morning is Monday
Where are you now?
Teasing my memory
teaching me how
To lay low when I don't want to
Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's making me crazy
Leaving me out in the open
When I don't want to

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're running all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

The moments of pleasure
Never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone
And in a hurry

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're running all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

You're running all over town
As much as you burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

Just like a wildfire, you're running all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

(Oh, oh oohashes by now)
(Oh, oh oohashes by now)
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now
