For all we know
We may never meet again
Before you go
Make this moment sweet again

We won't say goodnight
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This may only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripple on a stream

So love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know, we know

So love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know, we know
