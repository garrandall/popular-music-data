Well I told you once and I told you twice
But ya never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
'Cause I'll be gone a long, long time

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Last time baby
Last time baby (Maybe the last time)
I see you no more (Maybe the last time)
Baby I don't know (Maybe the last time)
Well I don't know (Maybe the last time)
No, I don't know (Maybe the last time)
No, I don't know (Maybe the last time)
No, I don't know (Maybe the last time)
