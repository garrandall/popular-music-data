These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, long to hold you again

The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, my baby, no no
You gave a promise to me, yeah
You broke it, and you broke it, oh no



These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end
This heart could not accept and pretend

The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
And you spoke it, and you spoke it, babe

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, these arms long to hold you, hold you again

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't ya know these...
