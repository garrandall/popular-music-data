Sally had a cigaret she wanted a doob
Bob said "you're an addict." Sally said "well, that's true."
Bob said "Sally, tell me, what's so frightening to you?"
"Well, just being in this city and sitting here with you."

A rag tag rehab clinic ain't nowhere to have fun
The TV's always blaring something really dumb
The attendants and the nurses all have clubs and guns
And the windows all got painted so we never see the sun

This is Party Time! Try to remember - it's Party Hearty Time!
This is Party Time! Let's get together
Got to have a Party Hearty Party all the time!

Outside the dogs are fighting, there's screaming in the dark
The sound is terrifying â it puts me into shock
My fears start taking over and growing on my mind
Then the nurses bring more medicine and I lose track of time

"I'm a little concerned," Bob said, "Because it seems to me
You really ought to integrate your personalities."
Then Sally said, "But if you listen, Bob, I'm sure you'll agree,
Sometimes there's sense in madness and none in sanity!"

This is Party Time! Try to remember - it's Party Hearty Time!
This is Party Time! Let's get together
Got to have a Party Hearty Party all the time!

Some of us are in here 'cause we needed out
Some have all the answers, and some have all the doubt
Some have seen too much to remember who they are
We're all just getting better, we've all come really far

I mind my own business in my own little way
My roommate gets the tremors every single day
But I don't even notice, I'm so far away
I'm a chemical experiment, but I think I'll be okay

This is Party Time! Come on, remember - it's Party Hearty Time!
Yes this is Party Time! Get hit together
Got to have a Party Hearty Party all the time!
It's Party Time! Let's get together - Hearty Party Time!
Come on, it's Party Time! Get hit together
Got to have a Party Hearty Party all the time!
