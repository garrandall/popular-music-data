Watch out boys look who's comin' down the street
Oh yeah she's a trouble maker, oh yeah she's a trouble maker
Here she comes walkin' on down the street
Look at her she looks so very sweet
But watch out she's a trouble maker
Watch out she's a heart breaker
She'll break your heart tear it apart
Have you heard she broke up Jerry & Joan
And found somebody new so Jerry's all alone
So watch out she's a trouble maker
Watch out she's a heart breaker
She'll break your heart tear it apart
She's just out to see how many love affairs he can break up
So if she tells you to quit your girl you better wake up
No don't you breakup
She's the kind to kiss and run away
I should know she was mine only yesterday
So watch out she's a trouble maker
Watch out she's a heart breaker
She'll break your heart tear it apart
She's the kind to kiss and run away
I should know she was mine only yesterday
So watch out she's a trouble maker
Watch out she's a heart breaker
Watch out boys look who's comin' down the street
Oh yeah she's a trouble maker
Watch out boys look who's comin' down the street
Oh yeah she's a heart breaker
Watch out boys look who's comin' down the street
