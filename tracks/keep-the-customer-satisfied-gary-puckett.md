Gee, but it's great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I've been on the road so long, my friend
And if you come along I know you wouldn't disagree

It's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered (slandered)
Libeled (libeled)
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm-a one step ahead of that shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
And I've got to keep my customers satisfied
So satisfied

Deputy sheriff said to me
What you came here for, boy?
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy and now you're heading into more

It's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered (slandered)
Oh, libeled (libeled)
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm-a so tired
Oh, so, so tired
And I've got to keep my customers satisfied
So satisfied

Uh, huh, huh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I know (I know)
Here that it's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered (slandered)
Libeled (libeled)
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm so tired
Oh, so, so tired
And I've got to keep my customers satisfied
So satisfied

Mmm, so satisfied
Got to keep 'em satisfied, child (so satisfied)
Everybody's got to be satisfied (so satisfied)
Oh! (so satisfied)
Got to keep my customer satisfied (so satisfied)
(So satisfied)
