Wait a minute, baby
If you're walking out the door
You better look before you leap, boy
Don't be coming back for more


Listen to me, baby
It's important that you try to understand
I am not a fighter, I'm a lover
I'll do anything I can
And


Don't make a fool of yourself
Better think it over, baby, one more time
Don't make a fool of yourself
Better get a grip before you lose your mind


Wait a minute, baby
Is it something that I said?
Nothing's coming from your heart, boy
It's only coming from your head (whoa, oh, oh)
Shake it, shake it, baby
If it's what you wanna do
Just remember everybody's baby
Wants to shake their booty too


Listen to me, baby
It's important that you try to understand
I am not a fighter, I'm a lover
And your wish is my command
And


Don't make a fool of yourself
Better think it over, baby, one more time
Don't make a fool of yourself
Better get a grip before you lose your mind


Listen, understand
Lover take my hand
Lover
Try to understand
Take my hand
Lover take my hand
And


Don't make a fool of yourself
Better think it over, baby, one more time
Don't make a fool of yourself
Better get a grip before you lose your mind
