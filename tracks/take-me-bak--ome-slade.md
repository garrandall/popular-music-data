Came up to you one night noticed the look in your eye,
I saw you was on your own, and it was alright, yeh it was alright.
They said I could call you Sidney, oh I couldn't make out why,
standing here on your own and it was alright, yeh it was alright.


So won't you take me back home, a take me back home,
and if we can find plenty to do and that will be alright
yeh it will be alright

O you and your bottle of brandy, both of you smell the same,
you're still on your feet, still standing so it was alright,
yeh it was alright.
The superman comes to meet you, looks twice the size of me,
I didn't stay round to say goodnight so it was alright,
yeh it was alright.



So won't you take me back home my baby, ah won't you take me back home yeh
I said take me, take me take, take me back home,
take me take me take, take me back home oh won't you..
