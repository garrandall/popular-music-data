Oh, my love, can't see no light shine through
It's dark out here and right now, I'm needing you
Wish I could hear the words that you'd say to me right now
Wish I knew where you were, you were here with me somehow

But you're somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)

Oh, my love, nothing's been making sense
I ask why is anyone listening?
Wish I could hear the words that you'd say to me right now
Wish I knew where you were, you were here with me somehow

But you're somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)

Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel)
Somebody's angel now (somebody's angel now)
