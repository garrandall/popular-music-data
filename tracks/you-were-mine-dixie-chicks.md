I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone


Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?


I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay


Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?


I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind?


Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?


I remember when you were mine
