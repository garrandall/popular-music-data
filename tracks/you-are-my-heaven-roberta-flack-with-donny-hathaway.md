An angel whispered to me when I woke this morning
That I would find heaven by my side
And there you were you angel, heaven in the morning
Laying in my arms and in my life

And I reached this decision, I love you, my religion
That is in my soul and in my heart
No one could ever change my mind, oh, no
'Cause I got you here right by my side

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
You are my love
Make me sing la di da

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take you away
(Won't let them take you away, take you, baby)

If angels whispered to you early every morning
It's really something wonderful and rare
I get up in the morning feeling that forever
I have all your love and all your care

If someone tries to tell that I do not love you
Tell them they must be out of their mind
I ain't gonna let them change my mind, oh, no
'Cause I got you here right by my side

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
You are my love
(You are my love)
Make me sing la di da

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take

Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take
Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take you away
(Won't let them take, take you, baby)

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
You are my love
(You are my love)
Make me sing la di da

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take you away
(Won't let them take)

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
You are my love
(You are my love)
Make me sing la di da

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
Darling, I, oh
I won't let them take you away
I won't let them take you

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven
You are my love
(You are my love)
Make me sing la di da

You are my love
(You are my love)
You are my heaven, oh
