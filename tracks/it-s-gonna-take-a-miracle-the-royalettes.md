Loving you so
I was too blind to see you letting me go
But now that you've set me free

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy letting me go
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Tho' I know I can't forget about you
I'm gonna try to show you how much you're turning me around
Destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore
You must realize you took your love and left me
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, it's gonna take a miracle
