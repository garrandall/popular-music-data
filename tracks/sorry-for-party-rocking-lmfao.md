Sorry for Party Rocking


Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and it's just called buffalo
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying turn it down!
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off ciroc, off patron, shit whatever's tasty!
We don't got no manners hanging of the rafters
Let's go drink for drink a hundred bucks she won't out last us
Check my style take a good look I'm fresh bitch in my whip with music so loud I'm deaf bitch
Getting brain at a redlight with people watching
Sorry for party rocking
If you show up already tore up this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you blacked out with your sack out this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in your ho's cup this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause your whiskey dick this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I don't give a fuck when I'm in the club, sippin bub, really drunk, and I see a fat booty
Gotta have it I'm a grab it, it's a habit automatic like uzi, with the sick flow
Make a chick go crazy and flash them ta-ta's it's redfoo the dude a true party rockaaaah

I'm true to the game too, it's called beerpong and I can't lose I got a bunch of bad bitches in the back
With ciroc on tap and a little bit of Grey Goose oooo
Oh yeah we killin shit with our money
We diligent so here's a sorry in advance no hard feelings bitch
Sorry for party rocking

People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying turn it down!
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking
