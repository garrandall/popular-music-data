Hey, pretty please now
Talk to me, baby
Sweet little girl
You're driving me crazy
Come on and tell me
What did I do to you

Girl, if you just sit there and cry
How am I ever gonna know why
Why you're mad at me
And how did I make you blue

Hey, pretty please now
Talk to me, baby
Hey, pretty please now
Talk to me, baby

Hey, pretty please now
Talk to me, baby
Open your heart
And, honey, then maybe
Something you say may
Give me a little clue

Now, before you drive me insane
Little girl, you gotta explain
Say anything but, baby
Don't say we're through

Did I forget your birthday
Did I forget to call
Girls get mad at such little things
How can a guy ever think of them all

Hey, pretty please now
Talk to me, baby
Sweet little thing
You're driving me crazy
Give me a break and
Do what I tell you to

I don't care
What I did that's wrong
Just come right here
Where you belong
And I'll find a way to
Make it all up to you

I gotta know right now
Come on talk to me, baby
You gotta say something, honey
Come on, come on, come on...
