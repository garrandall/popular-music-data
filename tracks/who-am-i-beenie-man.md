Yes nyah!
Cool nuh, Iyah
Hahaha
Who am I?
It's the girls dem sugar
Alright
Hear yah nuh


Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Beemer?
Who am I, the girls dem sugar
How can I, make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi the keys to my truck
Who am I, the girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to precious


You ever buck a gal weh deep like a bucket?
Draw fi your needle, and your needle can't stitch it
Draw fi your axe, and like a cow, you all a chop it
Draw fi your pick axe, and like a ground, you all a dig it
It's like a riverside, upon di banking you take it
It's like a bicycle, so you hold it, and dash it
Now you wash it, so you crash it, she a tell you say, "Your crabbit!"
Gyal, she a beg you and a bawl say fi, "stop it"
Badman plug in and mi a move off a electric
It's like a basketball, she take time-out fi vomit
Unuh listen to mi style, and unuh fi listen to mi lyrics
A Beenie Man deh yah, me a drop it (a say!)


Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Beemer?
Who am I, the girls dem sugar
How can I, make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi the keys to my truck
Who am I, the girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to precious


But anything she wants, I will give it unto she
I can't believe the day my friend dem tell me that she flee
I don't believe it's angry, and I don't believe it's grief
I don't believe it's Susan, or the other girls I breed
The love for me she have, that is the only thing I need
I don't think den right now, just to lose my main squeeze
Oh Guantanamera, you a killer!
Gyal, the way you hot, you have mi body under pressure
Man see your body, all a kill mosquito
Woman your body right, just fi know you got di power
But..


Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Beemer?
Who am I, the girls dem sugar
How can I, make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi the keys to my truck
Who am I, the girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to precious


Because!
I tell myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my guiding star, my shining light, I love you baby
But that day you leave and gone
I know that girls they're going crazy
I know the girls lump some, all of dem run
'Ccause di whole a dem want this baby
I told you and I told yuh twice
That I am the girls dem sugar
Now the girls dem attack me
And di girls dem a rush mi
Because dem a drive in a bimmer
A di girls dem flavour
I am no slaver I am the helper
No paper an a girl just watch
Yah a want unuh hear yah an listen weh di DJ seh


Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Beemer?
Who am I, the girls dem sugar
How can I, make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi the keys to my truck
Who am I, the girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to precious
