Late at night, body's yearning
Restless night, want to be with you
Someone's playing in the garden
So enticing, he's sure to take a bite
I don't know what's come over me, yeah

She's as heavy as a Chevy
Pure excitement, misled
When she touches, can't resist her
I'm a puppet when she's playing me
She's outgoing but I love her so misled
So I'm saying now

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place, you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Be misled, be for real

Thought I knew her, this lady
Opportunist, misled
Always searching for adventure
Like Pandora's box, misled
And I don't know what I'm gonna do without her

Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place, you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Be misled or be for real

I've got this feeling and it's blocking my way
But I love her just the same, just the same
Oh yes I do

Misled, heard you call my name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?
Misled, took me by the head
Misled, said I would understand

Misled, with a bomb of broken Venus
Misled, not a word is said
Misled, baby, that's your name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Misled, won't you be for real?

Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price If I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Hey misled, won't you be for real?

Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, ..
Misled, misled
Misled
I was misled by you
Misled
Misled
