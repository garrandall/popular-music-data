While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me


If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me


Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I want to buy ya everything
Except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
Because it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face


If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me


You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
Because everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again
When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you


If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever


If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me
