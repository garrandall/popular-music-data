Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
Let me lick up the cream
Cut the cake
Well, just a little piece
Baby you know what I mean
Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
A little lovin' on the side
Cut the cake
I need a little piece
Just to keep me satisfied

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
You got to cut it-down

Cut the cake
Just a little piece
Of your sweet love
Cut the cake
Don't you know that I
Can't get enough
Cut the cake
Want you to know that I
Ain't a greedy man
Cut the cake
Don't you know that I'll
Do the best I can

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
You got to cut it-down

Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
Let me lick up the cream
Cut the cake
Well, just a little piece
Baby you know what I mean
Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
A little lovin' on the side
Cut the cake
I need a little piece
Just to keep me satisfied

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Never knew you cooked the way you do
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Tastes so good don't pass the recipe around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme
