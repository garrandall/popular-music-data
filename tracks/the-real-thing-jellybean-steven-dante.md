(This is the real thing)
(This is the real thing)

They say that time is the only cure
To heal the hurt of a broken heart
I say you never can be sure
No no no
If I do, don't try to make a brand new start
In my mind love was just a dream
Like a fairytale
But you gave me the reason to believe that I should give it one more chance

There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing

You take me higher than I've ever gone
Yes you do
And in the way that makes me feel secure
Your love just warms me to the bone
Yes you do
And every day you give a little more
When I think about the love gone by
And what I've been through
I'm convinced that this one is right
Now girl there's nothing left to prove

There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing

Every minute, every hour
I can feel the power
This is the real thing
Love is not a fiction
Love is not a trick
This is the real thing

Oh, it's so easy now
Looking in your eyes yeah
When love comes so naturally
It's meant to be
Now I finally realise

Oh, do do do, do do do
I never knew, oh no, oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no

Do do do
I just don't, don't feel the same
I just don't, don't feel the same
I just don't, don't feel the same
Oh, woah, woah woah woah

When I think about the love gone by
And what I've been through
I'm convinced that this one is right
Now girl there's nothing left to prove

There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing (You've gotta believe)
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing (Now I know)

There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing (I wanna say it to you)

This is the real thing baby
Real thing
It's the real thing, real thing, oh
This is the real thing baby
Real thing (Did you hear what I'm saying to you girl?)
This is the real thing baby, real thing (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
This is the real thing baby, real thing (This is the real thing)
This is the real thing baby
