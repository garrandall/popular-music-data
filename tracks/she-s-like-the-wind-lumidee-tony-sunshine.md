Listen baby I've been around
I know that you like how I wear my crown
And I know that I'm something that is so profound
So far what I'm hearing look I like the sound
Everybody's talking about it
We would be talkin' why would you doubt it
Your palms are sweaty and your heart sounds poundin'
This is what you feeling tell me about it

She's like the wind
Through my tree
She ride all night... next to me
Like you won't believe... no...
She leaves me the moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
Damn it I believe she knows
She taking my heart
She doesn't know what she's done... baby please
I feel her breathe in my face (baby I can feel)
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league (she's out of my league oh)
Just a fool to believe she got everything I need
She's like the wind

If you can't conceive it muffin
Cuz you just let it be it's nothin'
Look we just hangin around
Sneaking a look
When I can just put you down

Girl I look in the mirror
And all I see
Is a young old man with only a dream
Am I just foolin' myself yeah
Thinkin' she'll stop the pain (Yes she will, yes she will)
Livin' without her... I'd go insane
Dam it I believe she knows
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league (she's out of my league oh)
Just a fool to believe she got everything I need
She's like the wind

Look I'm right here
C'mon toughin up
Boo get it together and just try your luck
Ever since I heard you got this lil crush I
Pass your way and its givin me a rush
So I peeped your style yes I'm inpressed
Always with the best put em other doods to the rest
So you ain't go to stress I got what you need
I could ease your pain and fulfil all your dreams

Just a fool to believe she got everything I need
I feel her breathe in my face
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
Shes out of my league
Just a fool to believe she got everything I need
She's like the wind

If you can't conceive it muffin
Cuz you just let it be it's nothin
Look we just hangin' around
Sneaking a look
When I can just put you down

She's like the wind
