Yea 
Yo 
Tony Sunshine 


Listen baby Iâve been around 
I know that you like how I wear my crown 
And I know that im something that is so profound 
So far what im hearing look I like the sound 
Everybodys talkin about it 
We could be talkin why would u doubt it 
Your plams are sweaty and your heart sounds poundin 
This is what u feeling tell me about it 


Shes like the wind 
Thru my tree 
(baby yea baby yea) 
Shes rides all night 
Next to me 
Like u wonât believe (No) 
She leaves me the moonlight 
Only to burn me wit the sun 
Damn it I believe she knows 
She takin my heart 
She doesnât know what shes done 
Baby please 

I feel her breath in my face (baby I can feel) 
Her bodys close to me (her body close to me) 
Canât look in her eyes (canât look in your eyes) 
Shes outta my league (shes outta my league oh) 
Just a fool to believe 
Shes got everything I need 
Shes like the wind 


If u cant conceive it muffin 
Cause u just let it be its nothing 
Look we just hangin around 
Sneakin a look 
When I can just put you down 


Girl I look in the mirror (what u see what u see) 
And all I see (tell me what u see girl, tell u I can feel this baby) 
Is a young old man with only a dream (ooo oh oh) 
Am I just fooling myself (yea) 
Thinkin she'll stop the pain (yes she will yes she will) 
Living without her 
I'd go insane 
Damn it I believe she knows 

Feel her breath on my face (baby I can feel) 
Her body close to me (her body close, yes I do) 
Can't look in her eyes (cant look in her eyes) 
She's outta of my league (shes outta my league oh) 
Just a fool to believe 
She got everything I need 
She's like the wind 


Look Iâm right here 
Come on toughin up 
Boo get it together and just try ur luck 
Ever since I herad u got this little crush i 
Pass ur way and its givin me a rush 
So I peeped ur style 
Yes Iâm impressed 
Always wit the best 
Put dem other dudes to rest 
So u aint got to stress cuz I got what u need 
I could ease ur pain and fulfill all ur dreams 

Just a fool to believe 
She got anything I need (take dat) 

I feel her breath in my face 
Her body close to me (clap yo hands) 
Canât look in her eyes, no (yea) 
Sheâs outta my league (move) 
Just a fool to believe (Move) 
She got anything I need 
Sheâs like the wind 


If u cant conceive it muffin 
Cause u just let it be its nothing 
Look we just hangin around 
Sneakin a look 
When I can just put you down 

If u cant conceive it muffin 
Cause u just let it be its nothing 
Look we just hangin around 
Sneakin a look 
When I can just put you down 

Move 
Tony Sunshine 
Yea 
Take dat 

Sheâs like the wind
