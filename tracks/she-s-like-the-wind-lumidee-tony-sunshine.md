Lumidee:
Listen baby i've been around
I know that you like how i wear my crown
And i know that im something that is so profound
So far what im hearing look i like the sound
Everybodys talking about it
We would be talkin why would you doubt it
Your palms are sweaty n your heart sounds poundin
This is what you feeling tell me about it

Tony Sunshine:
She's like the wind
Thru my tree
She ride all night... next to me
Like you won't believe... no...
She leaves me the moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
Dam it i believe she knows
She taking my heart
She doesnt know what shes done...baby please
I feel her breathe in my face(baby i can feel)
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
Shes out of my league(shes out of my league oohhh)
Just a fool to believe she got everything i need
Shes like the wind

Lumidee:
If you can't conceive it muffin
Cuz you just let it be itz nothin
Look we just hangin around
Sneaking a look
When i can jus put you down

Tony Sunshine:
Girl i look in the mirror
And all i see
Is a young old man with only a dream
Am i just foolin myself yea
Thinkin she'll stop the pain(Yes she will, yes she will)
Livin without her... i'd go insane
Dam it i believe she knows
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
Shes out of my league(shes out of my league oohhh)
Just a fool to believe she got everything i need
Shes like the wind

Lumidee:
Look im right here
Cmon toughin up
Boo get it together and just try your luck
Ever since i heard you got this lil crush i
Pass your way and its givin me a rush
So i peeped your style yes im inpressed
Always with the best put em other doods to the rest
So you ain't go to stress i got what you need
I could ease your pain and fulfil all your dreams

Tony Sunshine:
Just a fool to believe she got everything i need
I feel her breathe in my face
Her body's close to me
Can't look in her eyes
Shes out of my league
Just a fool to believe she got everything i need
Shes like the wind

Lumidee:
If you can't conceive it muffin
Cuz you just let it be itz nothin
Look we just hangin around
Sneaking a look
When i can jus put you down(x2)

Tony Sunshine(end):
Shes like the wind...
