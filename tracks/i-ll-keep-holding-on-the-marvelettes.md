I'll keep on holdin' on, oh yes I will, I'll keep on holdin' on
I know that you're the kind of guy, you've got too much pride
You're scared to love someone, run and hide
Each and every day, and each and every way
My love is growin' stronger
And I know that you can't hold on much longer
When there's no place left to hide
I'll still be by your side
'Cause I'll be, waiting, oh yes, sure 'nough
Looking for a chance, a chance to make you mine

I'll keep on holdin' on
I know you're braggin' to your friends that you can't be caught
Baby, you don't know, so it's time that you were taught
So love, you'd better plan to make your final stand
No matter where you run now
I'll hold on till my will to resist is gone
Till I get you where I want you
There, love, I'm gonna want you
Waiting, oh yes, sure 'nough
Looking for a chance, a chance to make you mine

I'll keep on holdin' on, No matter where you run, boy
I'll keep on holdin' on, No matter where you hide, boy
I'll keep on holdin' on, Oh you'll never get away, boy
I'll keep on holdin' on
