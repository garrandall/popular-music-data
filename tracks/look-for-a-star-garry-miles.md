When life doesn't seem worth the living
And you don't really care who you are
When you feel there is no one beside you
Look for a star

When you know you're alone and so lonely
And your friends have traveled afar
There is someone waiting to guide you
Look for a star

Oh everyone has a lucky star
That shines in the sky up above
If you wish on a lucky star
You're sure to find someone to love

A rich man man, a poor man, a beggar
No matter whoever you are
There's a friend whos waiting to guide you
Look for a star

A rich man, a poor man, a beggar
No matter whoever you are
There's a friend whos waiting to guide you
Look for a star.
