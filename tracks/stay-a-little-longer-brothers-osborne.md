Something like a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really shouldn't be

Give it one more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone and I'm picking up the phone

It's one more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's one more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

Stay a little longer

Wishing you could stay a little longer...
