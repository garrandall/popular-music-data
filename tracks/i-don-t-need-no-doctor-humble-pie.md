I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me


Yes I do, all I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
My prescription tell me that


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


All I need is my baby
Get back home, care for all my needs


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


Well, the doctor said I need rest
He put me on the critical list
Keeping me safe from harm
All I need is her sweet charm

He gave me a medicated lotion
That wouldn't do, oh yeah
My emotion, oh yeah


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Come on, hey
How do you feel?


Yeah, yeah
I don't need (No doctor)
I don't need (No doctor)
Yeah yeah yeah (No doctor)
Yeah yeah yeah (No doctor)


I don't need no doctor, yeah yeah
I don't need no doctor, yeah yeah
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


Had a good time
Had a good time
Had a good time
Had a good time
Had a good time
Had a good time, yeah yeah
I sure feel good
I sure feel good
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need it
I don't, I don't need it


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need
