Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine

Quiet thoughts come floating down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touch them and they burst apart with sweet memories

Faded photographs
Covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half
Memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love
Long ago
That didn't work out right
Traces of love

Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you

Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine

I close my eyes
And say a prayer
That in her heart she'll find
A trace of love still there
Somewhere

Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind (faded photographs)
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine (tickets torn in half)
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind (faded photographs)
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
