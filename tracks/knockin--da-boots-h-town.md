Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye all night long
Now I want that whole thing back
Make these moments once again go right
So won't ya, won't ya, uhhh, do it for us, babe

Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn
But oh, come on, a-come on
And turn the lights down, and let me get on it, yeah
‘Cause when I do, just me and you, it'll be so right

A-give me some good love

To makin' love to you, baby
All night long, baby, all night long, long, long, long


Good lovin', body rockin' all night long, oh, oh
Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn
But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down, and let me get on it, uh

So all you ladies go get your towels
You know what I'm sayin', ha

So let me make some sweet lovin', baby
