Nobody loves me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody hates me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Gee, I feel so low
(I feel so low)
I just think I'll go
(I think I'll go)
Out in the yard
And eat worms

Abby, let me tell you now

At a party or at a dance
I just don't feel loved
My mom and dad
They holler all the time
Everything I do is wrong

Dear Abby
Everything I do is wrong
Dear Abby

Nobody loves me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody hates me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Gee, I feel so low
(I feel so low)
I just think I'll go
(I think I'll go)
Out in the yard
And eat worms

Listen to me, Abby now

I've a problem
I'm all mixed up
So write to me right away
Gee, on second thought
What's the use
I know what you're gonna say

Yeah, yeah
I know what you're gonna say

Dear mixed up teenager
Gee, baby, you say
Nobody loves you
And everybody hates you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know, baby
For someone so low
I gotta suggest that
You do go on out in
That yard and eat worms
Yeah, worms

Squiggly little worms
Wiggly little worms
Dear Abby

Nobody loves me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody hates me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
