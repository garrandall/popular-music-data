Back about 1825
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been ridin' on the Tennessee Stud

I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean 
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

We drifted on down onto no man's land 
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and a gambler couldn't agree 
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud

Well, I got as lonesome as a man can be
Dreamin' about my girl in Tennessee
Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was dreaming of his sweetheart, too

We loped across to Arkansas
I whipped her brother and whipped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was ridin' on the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean 
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side 
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
On the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud

Now I've got a little baby on the cabin floor
A little horse colt playin' 'round the door
And I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
