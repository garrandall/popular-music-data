Oh, oh, oh...

I'm here to love you
Lay my heart on the line for you
Live and die for you

Sure as the sunrise, baby
You can bet that I'll be around
No way I'll go, I'll stay so close
I'll be there


I made a commitment of the heart
To keep this love together
I, I'll do whatever it takes
To make this love work out
I, I'm in this forever
I promise from the start, my baby

Commitment of the heart

I'll be right there beside you
Share the good and the bad times too
Pledge my soul only to you
And when you turn to me, baby
You can bet I won't turn away

I won't walk out, no way, no how
I'll be there



(To always love you)
I'm committed
(To always show you)
Show you all the love you need

(Nothing I won't do)
I'll do it all for you, baby
I'll be there

Committed to your heart, baby
Hoo, hoo, hoo



I made a commitment of the heart
To keep this love together
I, I'll do whatever it takes
To make this love work out
I, I'm in this forever

It takes so much love, baby, yeah
