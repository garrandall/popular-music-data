Come here boy
Awww baby
Girlfriend check it out
Hey, hey, hey,
Shape up girls

A cross between a movie star
And a hero in a book
Romeo comes struttin' in
And everybody looks
'Cause he's just got that
Special thang
That everybody needs
And everybody wants him
But not as bad as me

Hey, Romeo, where art thou
Get out here on the floor
I want to dance you darlin'
'Til you forget wherefore
Let's two step to a new step
We'll keep it all in line
And we'll call this the Romeo
'Cause your so mighty fine

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come
Dance with me

That sexy little body
Beats all I've ever seen
I ain't never seen a cowboy
Look that good in jeans
My temperature keeps risin'
Every time we meet
I may not be in love
But let me tell you,
I'm in heat

Romeo, Romeo, I just know
I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be
Your Juliet

So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away
From love
So don't step out on me

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with
The magic feet

Check, check, check, check
Check it out

So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away
From love
So don't step out on me

Romeo, Romeo, I just know
I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo,
Won't you be my Juliet
Romeo, Romeo,
Romeo, Romeo
