Someone up there
I wanna thank you so much
For sending her sweet love
To me, yeah

I been so alone
Never had a girl of my own

I wanna thank you

Said I wanna thank you
(Yeah, I wanna thank you)

Must have heard my prayer
She's loving and so good

And it's good that she's mine

Thanking you for the very best
That you give to me

And I promise you that I'm gonna
Take care of my sweet little girl
With everything that's in me
Hear me pray now

Someone up there
I wanna thank you so much
For sending her sweet love
To me, yeah, yeah

Never had a girl of my own
