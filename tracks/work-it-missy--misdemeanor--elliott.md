DJ, please pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive!

Come on! Come on!

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
If you got a big dick, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

I'd like to get to know ya so I could show ya
Put the pussy on ya like I told ya
Give me all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank, then call me ova
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or won't you
Go downtown and eat it like a vulture
See my hips and my tips, don't ya
See my ass and my lips, don't ya
Lost a few pounds and my waist for ya
This the kinda beat that go ra-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it, I need a glass of water
Boy oh boy, it's good to know ya

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
If you got a big dick, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

If you a fly gal get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-a
Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer
Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster
See the Belvedere playing tricks on you
Girlfriend wanna be like me, never
You won't find a bitch that's even better
I make you hot as Las Vegas weather
Listen up close while I take it backwards
I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want
I love your braids and your mouth full of floss
Love the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum
Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
You think you can handle this badonkadonk-donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights on so you see what I could do

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
If you got a big dick, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
Why-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Rock-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's 9 to 5 or shaking your ass
Ain't no shame, ladies do your thing
Just make sure you ahead of the game
Just cause I got a lot of fame super
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir
Picture black Sam, oh yes a massa
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man and Big Red could out last ya
Who is the best, I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matter
Why you act dumb like, uh, duh
So you act dumb like, uh, duh
As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom
Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabun

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
If you got a big dick, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

To my fellas, I like the way you work that
To my ladies, you sure know how to work that
