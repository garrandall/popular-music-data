I've come out of hiding by and by
(Been all alone)
Cause I've been immobilized for so long
(On my own)
Slowly emerging from the dark
(It's just day by night)
I feel like I've wasted so much time

I've been
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Finally decided on a change
(So take a chance)
No more cowards holding hands
(Tomorrow brings the unknown)
Well, I'm gonna break up all the rules
(Take 'em all by storm)
Tear down the barriers, on the loose

Cause I've been
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Oh, living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

We're part of all the story
Well, can't you see
That love has control?
Got no reason now to worry
Just count on me
Cause love has gotta take control
You can take hold

Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Living in the background 
Living in the background 
Living in the background 

Finally decided on a change
(So take a chance)
No more cowards holding hands
(Tomorrow brings the unknown)
Well, I'm gonna break up all the rules, rules
Living in the background 
Living in the background 
Living in the background 

Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true
Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true

Don't you go living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)
Living in the background (woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Living in the background (so true)

Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true
Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true

Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true
Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true

Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true
Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true

Woah-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
So true
